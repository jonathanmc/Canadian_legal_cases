    Allan and Jeff Kienapple (the “Employees”) worked for H. L. Staebler Company
    Limited.  They sold commercial insurance (property, casualty and automobile)
    to businesses.  On October 15, 2003, the Employees resigned and immediately
    began working in a similar capacity for Stevenson &amp; Hunt Insurance Brokers
    (KWC) Limited.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    of the Employees had written employment contracts with Staebler.  The contracts
    contained a restrictive covenant which stipulated that for two years after
    the termination of employment, they were not to “conduct business with any
    clients or customers of H. L. Staebler Company Limited that were handled
    or serviced by you at the date of your termination”.  The employment contracts
    also contained a liquidated damages clause.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Staebler
    sued the Employees for, among other things, breach of the restrictive covenant.  Stevenson
    &amp; Hunt Insurance Brokers (KWC) Limited and its affiliate Stevenson &amp;
    Hunt Insurance Brokers Limited (collectively “Stevenson &amp; Hunt”) were
    also named as defendants.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    October 29, 2003, Staebler obtained an injunction preventing the Employees
    and Stevenson &amp; Hunt from soliciting their customers.  By that date,
    approximately 118 clients had moved their business from Staebler to Stevenson &amp; Hunt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    a thirteen-day trial, Taylor J. found both the restrictive covenant and the
    liquidated damages clause in each of the employment contracts to be enforceable.  By
    judgment dated September 13, 2007 (the “Judgment”), he ordered the Employees
    and Stevenson &amp; Hunt (collectively the “appellants”) to pay Staebler
    approximately $2 million in damages.  He declined to make the punitive damages
    award which Staebler had also sought.</p>

    damages.</p>

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  Staebler
    is a large insurance broker that sells commercial, personal and group benefits
    insurance in the region of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Waterloo,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario.  It is well-established and has operated in the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Waterloo region for more than a century.  The Philpott family has owned Staebler
    since 1980 and is active in the business.  In 2003, Staebler had over fifty
    employees, at least 12,000 clients and $5.5 million in annual sales.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Messrs.
    Allan and Kienapple began employment with Staebler in 1982 and 1995 respectively.  Their
    role was no different than that of any other salesperson selling commercial
    insurance at Staebler.  They sold insurance according to Staebler procedures
    and earned income based on gross commissions received by Staebler on the
    annual renewal of policies.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    2003, Mr. Allan had between seventy-five and one hundred clients.  Half had
    been “gifted”
    to him and the other half was new business that he had developed.  Mr. Kienapple
    had one hundred clients.  Thirteen had been “gifted” to him by a retiring
    salesperson.  Of the balance, some were part of a book of business that he
    had sold to Staebler in 1995.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Salespeople
    in the insurance brokerage industry develop close relationships with their
    clients.  Staebler managed these relationships by assigning clients to salespersons
    and by deciding to whom clients would be “gifted” when a salesperson retired.  It
    also controlled the marketing, billing, client finances and relationships
    with insurance companies.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  At
    Staebler, a number of different employees would provide services to a commercial
    salesperson’s clients.  Customer service representatives dealt with clients
    on a frequent basis.  Commercial marketers negotiated clients’
    contracts with the insurance companies.  Sales staff at Staebler -- other
    than the Employees -- sold personal and group benefits insurance to the Employees’ commercial
    clients.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    early 2000, Stephen Philpott was President and Chief Executive Officer for
    Staebler.  He restructured the management team. He terminated the employment
    of the Vice President of Marketing and Underwriting and the Vice President
    of Finance.  He also demoted the Vice President of Sales.  He appointed his
    wife, Kim Philpott, to a newly created position which had essentially the
    same duties as those of the former Vice President of Sales.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Employees reported to Kim Philpott who, in turn, reported to Stephen Philpott.  They
    were not happy with the changes to the management team and were particularly
    unhappy with the appointment of Kim Philpott, whom they considered to be
    unqualified for the position that she filled.  Both had approached Steve
    Philpott about being considered for senior management positions and been
    told that would not happen.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    October 15, 2003, the Employees resigned and immediately began working at
    Stevenson &amp; Hunt as commercial sales agents.  Both entered into the Stevenson &amp; Hunt
    standard employment contract which contained the following restrictive covenant
    (the “Stevenson &amp; Hunt restrictive covenant”).  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>6.01 <u>Non-competition/Non-solicitation.</u> The
    Employee acknowledges that by reason of his employment with the Employer,
    he will or may develop a close working relationship with the Employer’s and/or
    its Affiliates’
    and/or its associates’ customers and clients, gain a knowledge of the Employer’s
    and/or its Affiliates’ and/or its associates’ methods of operation and acquire
    and be exposed to confidential materials and information, all of which would
    cause it irreparable harm and injury to the Employer and/or its Affiliates
    and/or its associates if made available to a competitor or used for competitive
    purposes.  Accordingly, the Employee agrees that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>                                                …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii) The Employee shall not, for any reason, directly
    or indirectly, without the prior written consent of the Employer, either
    during the term of this Agreement or for a period of eighteen (18) months
    following the termination of this Agreement, regardless of how that termination
    should occur,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>a) solicit or otherwise contact any client or customer
    or any potential client or customer (for purposes of this section 6.01 (2), “potential
    client or customer”, means         any individual, corporation, partnership,
    association or other entity which was, to the knowledge of the Employee,
    actively pursued by the Employer as a potential client or customer) of the
    Employer and/or its Affiliates and/or its associates who or which was a client
    or customer or potential client or customer of the Employer and/or its Affiliates
    and/or its associates in the twelve month period immediately proceeding [sic]
    the termination, for the purpose of selling any products or services to that
    client or customer or potential client or customer, or for the purposes of
    soliciting orders of any products or services from that client or customer
    or potential client or customer, or</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>b) provide any services or product to any client
    or customer or potential client or customer, of the Employer and/or its Affiliates
    and/or its associates who or which was a client or customer or potential
    client or customer of the Employer and/or its Affiliates and/or its associates
    in the twelve month period immediately proceeding [sic] the termination,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>where such products or services are the same as
    or substantially similar to or in any way competitive with the products or
    services sold by the Employer and/or its Affiliates and/or its associates
    at the time of the termination of this Agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Between
    October 15 and 29, 2003, as a result of being solicited by the Employees,
    118 of their clients transferred their business from Staebler to Stevenson &amp; Hunt.  Staebler
    claimed that by conducting business with these clients, the Employees were
    in breach of clause 10 of their employment contracts and that it was entitled
    to damages in accordance with its terms.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Clause
    10 reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>10. In the event of termination of your employment
    with the Company, you undertake that you will not, for a period of 2 consecutive
    years following said termination, conduct business with any clients or customers
    of H.L. Staebler Company Limited that were handled or serviced by you at
    the date of your termination.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The damages for any breach of this undertaking
    shall be a sum equal to 1 ½ times the commission income received by you or
    your subsequent employer on account of business conducted on behalf of persons
    or businesses that were clients/customers of H.L. Staebler Company Limited
    as at the time of your termination of employment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first paragraph of clause 10 shall be referred to as the “Restrictive Covenant”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Staebler
    obtained an injunction that lasted from October 29, 2003, to October 15,
    2005.  The injunction prevented the appellants from soliciting or accepting
    business from any Staebler client.<a href="#_ftn1"

    had a different restrictive covenant with five of its other commercial salespeople.  Under
    the terms of that covenant, the commercial salesperson was allowed to solicit
    and conduct business with Staebler clients so long as he or she did not operate
    within a 50 mile radius of the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Waterloo region for two years (the “50 mile radius clause”).   </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE TRIAL DECISION   </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    setting out the facts and issues, the trial judge referred to <i>Elsley Estate
    v. J.G. Collins</i> <i>Insurance Agencies Ltd</i>., [1978] 2 S.C.R. 916 for
    the governing principles.  In accordance with those principles, he first
    determined that the Staebler book of business was an asset which it owned
    and was entitled to protect.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thereafter,
    the trial judge considered whether the Restrictive Covenant was reasonable
    as between the parties.  He did this by asking whether it was reasonably
    required for Staebler’s protection.  He gave three reasons for concluding
    that it was. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first reason was that the Employees knew that they would not receive the
    benefit of “gifted” clients unless they signed employment contracts with
    Staebler.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second reason given for finding that the Restrictive Covenant was reasonably
    required for Staebler’s protection was based on the close personal relationship
    between the Employees and their clients.  This, the trial judge concluded,
    meant that a non-solicitation clause was not sufficient to protect Staebler’s
    proprietary interest.  In so reasoning, the trial judge expressed the view
    that the Restrictive Covenant was a “hybrid”
    clause.  At para. 23 of the reasons, he explained:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>By this I mean the covenant
    in question is a combination of a non-solicitation and a non-competition
    clause.  The clause prohibits the former employee from conducting business
    with any clients of Staebler that were handled or serviced by the employee
    at the date of his or her termination.  It does not prevent solicitation.  Nor
    does it stop the former employee from acting as an insurance broker selling
    commercial insurance, or accepting employment with a competing insurance
    brokerage, in the Region of Waterloo.  The former employee is at liberty
    to contact other Staebler clients, not handled or serviced by him or her,
    with a view to enticing those clients to transfer their insurance business
    from Staebler.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    third reason was that the trial judge found the Restrictive Covenant to be
    less restrictive than the Stevenson &amp; Hunt restrictive covenant because
    the latter prohibited solicitation of anyone who was a client or customer
    or potential client or customer of Stevenson &amp;
    Hunt in the twelve month period preceding termination of employment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thereafter,
    the trial judge considered whether the Restrictive Covenant was reasonable
    with reference to the public interest.  He concluded that it was reasonable
    because: (1) it did not prevent the Employees from obtaining lucrative new
    employment and the new employment was not contingent on the Employees bringing
    clients with them; and, (2) the Restrictive Covenant’s two-year duration
    fell within the industry norm, which he found was between eighteen months
    and three years.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Paragraph
    10 of the employment contracts also provided that the damages suffered by
    Staebler would equal 1.5 times the commission earned by the new employer
    on account of business from the clients who transferred their accounts as
    a result of a breach of the Restrictive Covenant.  The trial judge found
    that the actual damages suffered were less than the amount calculated using
    the damages clause.  However, because he found that the stipulated amount
    was not extravagant and unconscionable when compared with what the actual
    loss could possibly have been, the trial judge ordered the appellants to
    pay the stipulated amount in accordance with the penalty clause.  </p>

    the Employees; (2) Stevenson &amp; Hunt was aware of the existence of these
    contracts; (3) Stevenson &amp; Hunt intended to and did encourage the Employees

    Staebler unprepared to respond quickly, the trial judge did not find the
    conduct to be vindictive, reprehensible, malicious or sufficiently oppressive
    and high-handed so as to offend the court’s sense of decency.  In his view,
    Stevenson &amp;
    Hunt made a business decision based on its view that the Restrictive Covenant
    was unenforceable.  He also found that the appellants had litigated appropriately.  In
    declining to award punitive damages, the trial judge was also influenced
    by the fact that the amount ordered as damages pursuant to the liquidated
    damages clause in the employment contract was in excess of the actual loss

    is no dispute about the legal principles that apply when determining whether
    a restrictive covenant in an employment contract is enforceable, as those
    principles have long been settled.  Several decades ago in <i>Elsley</i>,
    the seminal Canadian case on this matter, Dickson J. described the principles
    as “well-established”.<a

    test reflects the competing principles that must be balanced when a court
    is called on to decide the validity of such a covenant.  On the one hand,
    there is the
    “important public interest in discouraging restraints on trade, and maintaining
    free and open competition unencumbered by the fetters of restrictive covenants”.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[4]</span></span></span></a>  Open competition benefits both society and the
    affected employees.  Society benefits from having greater choice and employees
    benefit as they have greater employment opportunities.  On the other hand,
    however, “the courts have been disinclined to restrict the right to contract,
    particularly when that right has been exercised by knowledgeable persons
    of equal bargaining power”.<a href="#_ftn5"

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    an overly broad restraint on an individual’s freedom to compete will generally
    be unenforceable, the courts must recognize and afford “reasonable protection
    to trade secrets, confidential information, and trade connections of the
    employer.”<a href="#_ftn6"

    is the mechanism by which a court decides whether a covenant is “overly broad” or
    is only that which is reasonably required for the employer’s protection.  But
    how is a court to determine whether any given restrictive covenant is
    “reasonable”?  <i>Elsley</i> offers a framework for making such a determination.  The
    starting point is “an overall assessment of the clause, the agreement within
    which it is found, and all of the surrounding circumstances”.<a href="#_ftn7"

    did the employer have a proprietary interest entitled to protection?  Second,
    are the temporal or spatial features of the covenant too broad? And, third,
    is the covenant unenforceable as being against competition generally, and
    not limited to proscribing solicitation of clients of the former employer?<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span

    turning to an assessment of the Restrictive Covenant and a consideration
    of the three factors, two additional principles that operate in this area
    warrant mention.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first such principle relates to the nature of the restrictive covenant.  A
    restrictive covenant may restrain either competition or solicitation.  A
    non-competition clause restrains the departing employee from conducting business
    with former clients and customers whereas a non-solicitation clause merely
    prohibits the departing employee from soliciting their business.      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <i>Lyons</i><i> v. Multari</i> (2000), 50 O.R. (3d) 526 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) at para. 31, MacPherson J.A. explained the difference between the two types
    of clauses in these terms:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The non-competition clause is a more drastic weapon
    in an employer’s arsenal.  Its focus is much broader than an attempt to protect
    the employer’s client or customer base; it extends to an attempt to keep
    the former employee out of the business.  Usually, non-competition clauses
    are limited in terms of space and time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Elsley</i> makes
    it clear that a non-solicitation clause is normally sufficient to protect
    an employer’s proprietary interest and that a non-competition clause is warranted
    only in exceptional circumstances.  At pages 925 and 926 of <i>Elsley</i>,
    Dickson J. wrote:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The next and crucial question is whether the covenant
    is unenforceable as being against competition generally, and not limited
    to proscribing solicitation of clients of the former employer.  In a conventional
    employer/employee situation the clause might well be held invalid for that
    reason. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>                                                …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Nevertheless, <i>in exceptional cases</i>, of which
    I think this is one, the nature of the employment may justify a covenant
    prohibiting an employee not only from soliciting customers, but also from
    establishing his own business or working for others so as to be likely to
    appropriate the employer’s trade connection through his acquaintance with
    the employer’s customers.  This may indeed be the only effective covenant
    to protect the proprietary interest of the employer.  A simple non-solicitation
    clause would not suffice.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly,
    at para. 33 of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    <i>Lyons</i>, MacPherson J.A. states, “Generally speaking, the courts will
    not enforce a non-competition clause if a non-solicitation clause would adequately
    protect an employer’s interests”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In

    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Lyons</i><i> </i>is that a non-solicitation clause -- suitably restrained
    in temporal and spatial terms -- is more likely to represent a reasonable
    balance of the competing interests than is a non-competition clause.  An
    appropriately limited non-solicitation clause offers protection for an employer
    without unduly compromising a person’s ability to work in his or her chosen
    field.  A non-competition clause, on the other hand, is enforceable only
    in exceptional circumstances.  </p>

    will be recalled that the trial judge found that the Restrictive Covenant
    was a “hybrid” clause.  I disagree.  On a plain reading of the Restrictive
    Covenant, it is a non-competition clause.  It does not purport to merely
    restrain the Employees from soliciting the clients and customers they had
    served when they worked at Staebler, it prohibits the Employees from “conduct[ing]
    business” with any such clients or customers.          </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    has been mentioned, <i>Elsley </i>indicates that an assessment of the clause

    the character of the employee’s position.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span

    (2) the Employees enjoyed close personal relationships with their clients. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, neither finding justifies the trial judge’s conclusion that the
    Restrictive Covenant was reasonable.  The findings indicate only that an
    employment contract with some type of restrictive covenant was warranted.  They
    do not, on their own, provide evidence of “exceptional” circumstances that
    would justify a non-competition clause nor do they speak to the reasonableness
    of the limits of the Restrictive Covenant.  In order to decide those matters,
    the three factors enunciated in <i>Elsley </i>must be considered.  I turn
    to a consideration of those factors now. </p>

    MacPherson J. A. noted in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    <i>Lyons</i>, non-competition clauses are generally limited in space and
    time.  While the Restrictive Covenant has a two-year time limit, it has no
    geographical limit – it prohibits the Employees from conducting business
    with former clients no matter where the Employees are located.  Thus, unlike
    the 50 mile radius clause which Staebler had with other of its commercial
    salespeople, the Employees could not do business with their former clients
    even if they relocated outside of the 50 mile radius.  By the terms of the
    Restrictive Covenant, the Employees were prohibited from doing business with
    their former clients even if they relocated to the far reaches of
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario or, for that matter, elsewhere in
    <st1:place w:st="on">

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore,
    there is no limit in the Restrictive Covenant on the type of work which the
    Employees are prohibited from conducting: the prohibition is against doing “business” with
    their clients and customers.  Thus, had Messrs. Allan and Kienapple chosen
    to leave the field of commercial insurance and undertaken any other type
    of work, including work which in no way competed with Staebler, the breadth
    of the Restrictive Covenant is such that they would have been precluded from
    conducting business with their clients.  To preclude the Employees from conducting
    business of any sort with their clients goes well beyond protecting Staebler’s “trade
    connections”.  In this regard I disagree with the trial judge who found that
    the broad prohibition against “doing business” did not taint the reasonableness
    of the Restrictive Covenant.      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    also disagree with the trial judge’s conclusion that the Restrictive Covenant
    was reasonable because it was less restrictive than was the Stevenson &amp; Hunt
    restrictive covenant.  The trial judge was entitled to consider the Stevenson &amp; Hunt
    restrictive covenant when assessing the reasonableness of the Restrictive
    Covenant:  see <i>Ash Temple Limited v. Croney </i>at para. 33.  However,
    the Restrictive Covenant is a blanket non-competition clause whereas the
    Stevenson &amp; Hunt covenant is limited to prohibiting solicitation and
    provision of competing services and products.  As an unlimited prohibition
    on conducting business places a greater restraint on an individual, <i>prima
    facie</i>, the Restrictive Covenant is more restrictive than is the Stevenson &amp; Hunt
    clause, even though the latter clause encompasses a wider class of people.  Furthermore,
    the Restrictive Covenant is for a substantially longer period of time (two
    years as opposed to eighteen months).  In any event, as the validity of the
    Stevenson &amp; Hunt clause has not been determined, its usefulness is constrained
    to being some evidence of industry standards.       </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    absence of a geographical limit combined with the blanket prohibition on
    conducting business renders the Restrictive Covenant “overbroad”
    and unenforceable.  It unreasonably restricts the Employees’ economic interests
    and goes beyond that which is reasonably necessary to protect Staebler’s
    proprietary interest.  Accordingly, I find it unnecessary to deal with the
    appellants’ submission that the two-year duration of the covenant was excessive
    in the industry and imposed an unreasonable restriction on the Employees.    </p>

    salespeople that worked for Staebler.  They did not play an exceptional role
    in the Staebler business – they were ordinary salespeople.  They were not
    managers, directors or key employees.  They did not stand in a fiduciary
    relationship with Staebler.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the Employees had close personal relationships with their clients, that is
    the industry norm.  Those relationships were not exclusive; other Staebler
    employees served the clients in various capacities.  This is an important
    difference between the role that the Employees played at Staebler and that
    of Mr. Elsley who “was the business”.<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span

'>[14]</span></span></span></a>  Furthermore, and again in contradistinction
    to <i>Elsley</i>, there was an imbalance of bargaining power between the
    Employees and Staebler when the employment contracts were negotiated whereas
    Mr. Elsley bargained as an equal when selling his business and then carried
    on as its general manager.          </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    50 mile radius clause which Staebler had with five of its other commercial
    salespeople is significant.  Under its terms, those employees could solicit
    their clients and customers and conduct business with Staebler clients so
    long as they did so outside of a 50 mile radius of the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place

    among Staebler’s commercial insurance salespeople which leads me to conclude
    that Staebler itself viewed the 50 mile radius clause as sufficient protection
    of its interest.  Clearly, the terms of the Restrictive Covenant are far
    more restrictive than are those of the 50 mile radius clause.<a

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>DISPOSITION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I would allow the appeal and set aside paras. 2 and 3 of the Judgment.  I
    would dismiss the cross-appeal.  The appellants are entitled to costs of
    the appeal and cross-appeal which I would fix at $44,000.00, inclusive of
    disbursements and G.S.T.  In light of the result on appeal, they are also
    entitled to their costs of the trial.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge indicated that he would deal with the matter of trial costs when
    he dealt with damages arising from the injunction.  I accept counsel’s joint
    submission that in view of that, the quantum of trial costs should be left
    to be determined by the trial judge.  However, I would note that, in light
    of the submissions this court has heard on the “hard ball” tactics that may
    have been used by the respondent, the scale of such costs is a live issue.  </p>
