style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    is an appeal from the order of Lederman J. (the motion judge) dismissing
    the defendants’ (appellants’) motion for an order dismissing or staying the
    action brought against them by the respondent (plaintiff).  The order further
    provided that the <i>ex juris</i> service on the non-Ontario defendants was
    valid under Rule 17.02(h).  The non-Ontario defendants also appeal this order.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    order staying or dismissing the action was sought first on the basis that
    the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario court had no jurisdiction over the non-Ontario defendants and, second,
    on the basis that even if the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario court had jurisdiction, it was not the <i>forum conveniens</i> for
    the trial of the action.  In addition, the non-Ontario defendants argued
    that the <i>ex juris</i> service should be set aside on the basis that the
    plaintiff did not allege damages suffered in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario as a consequence of the defendants’ misconduct.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants contend that the motion judge erred in law in holding that an
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario court could assume jurisdiction over the non-Ontario defendants.  They
    further argue that even if the finding that
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario had jurisdiction did not constitute an error in law, the motion judge
    erred in holding that
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario was an appropriate forum in which to litigate the claims.  Lastly,
    the non-Ontario defendants argue that the trial judge misapplied Rule 17.02(h)
    when he concluded that it authorized <i>ex juris</i> service in respect of
    these claims.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    would dismiss the appeals substantially for the reasons given by the motion
    judge, although I arrive at the same result on the jurisdictional question
    by a somewhat different route.</p>
  <h2>II.        BACKGROUND</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    reasons of the motion judge are reported at [2008] O.J. No. 1236.  I will
    not repeat his careful summary of the factual background.  These reasons
    should be read in conjunction with the motion judge’s reasons.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    are nine defendants, seven of which are not
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario residents (one of the non-Ontario residents is effectively controlled
    by one of the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario defendants).  None of the non-Ontario defendants are present in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario and none have attorned to this jurisdiction.  Assumed jurisdiction
    is the only potential basis upon which an
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario court has jurisdiction over the non-Ontario defendants.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    plaintiff alleges that it hired the
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    Ontario defendant, Gregory Peebles, and his company, Haviland Management
    Inc., to procure financing to develop certain mining projects in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Peru</st1:country-region>
    .  The plaintiff claims that the
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    Ontario defendants then solicited the assistance of Gregory Charles Smith,
    a Texan, and his companies to secure the necessary financing through sources
    in the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">United Kingdom</st1:country-region>
    .  According to the plaintiff, Peebles and his company were to work with
    Smith and his companies to procure the financing.  The plaintiff understood
    that Peebles and Smith would receive shares in the plaintiff’s
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario corporation as compensation for their efforts on the plaintiff’s
    behalf.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    plaintiff contends that Peebles and his company, and Smith and his companies,
    owed a fiduciary duty and a duty of confidentiality to the plaintiff.  The
    plaintiff further contends in his claim that, through a series of events
    and transaction, Peebles, Smith and various corporate entities controlled
    by them breached those duties, allowing Smith and companies he controlled
    eventually to take the mining opportunities in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Peru</st1:country-region>
    for themselves to the exclusion of the plaintiff.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    characterization of the plaintiff’s claim was an important step in the determination
    of whether the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario court had jurisdiction.  The appellants argued on the motion and
    again on appeal, that the plaintiff’s claims, in their essence, alleged breaches
    of a series of agreements between the plaintiff and various defendants.  Many
    of those agreements contained provisions giving the English courts exclusive
    jurisdiction over disputes arising out of the agreements.  The appellants
    argued that these exclusive-jurisdiction provisions applied to the plaintiff’s
    action.  On the appellants’ submissions, the exclusive jurisdiction provisions
    provided a strong argument both against the assumption of jurisdiction and,
    if jurisdiction was taken, the further determination that
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario was the most appropriate forum:  see <i>Z.I. Pompey Industrie v.
    E.C.U.-Ligne N.A.</i>, [2003] S.C.J. No. 23 at para. 20.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    characterization of the claims depends in large measure on the contents of
    the statement of claim.  That document is long and in some respects unclear.  The
    motion judge reviewed the claim and the additional material filed on the
    motion.  He did not accept the appellants’ contention that the plaintiff’s
    lawsuit was in essence a series of claims based on alleged breaches of the
    contracts.  He characterized the claim in this way at paras. 19-20:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>I accept the
    plaintiff’s characterization <u>of this claim as, in pith and substance,
    centering on the fiduciary relationship between PMCC and Peebles and Smith.  The
    allegation is that the two deliberately orchestrated events to put PMCC at
    a disadvantage, to ultimately pursue the Peruvian opportunities in their
    own interests.</u>  The objects of an agency relationship should not be the
    sole determinant of that relationship’s character.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>This alleged
    orchestration included improprieties in preparing and executing the loan
    advance documents and the Asset Purchase Agreement.  <u>However, this case
    is not about Smith’s loans to PMCC or the Asset Purchase Agreement: it is
    about an allegedly abusive course of conduct by fiduciaries.  The suit is
    not contractual in substance.</u>  Although PMCC has specifically pleaded
    a breach of the Asset Purchase Agreement, on a review of the Amended Statement
    of Claim as a whole, <u>I am satisfied that the references to the loan advances
    and Asset Purchase Agreement serve as illustrations or iterations of the
    defendants’ breaches of their duties of confidence, loyalty and good faith
    and as part of a broader narrative of abusive conduct.</u> [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    agree with the motion judge’s characterization of the claim.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    other significant feature of the claim for jurisdictional purposes arises
    out of the remedies sought by the plaintiff.  In essence, the plaintiff seeks
    orders in the nature of disgorgement of the profits the defendants gained
    as a result of the alleged breaches of their duties to the plaintiff.  The
    disgorgement takes the form of a constructive trust over any interest any
    of the defendants have in the Peruvian properties, or a constructive trust
    over the shares in various foreign corporate defendants.  </p>
  <h2>III.       THE JURISDICTIONAL QUESTION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge set out his reasons for holding that the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario court had jurisdiction with his usual clarity.  He approached the
    jurisdictional question in two stages.  First, he determined whether the
    Ontario court had jurisdiction to grant the remedies sought by the plaintiff
    even though those remedies potentially affected property (shares and land)
    in foreign jurisdictions (paras. 22-34).  At this stage of the inquiry, he
    considered and applied the four-part test set out in <i>Catania v. Giannattasio</i> (1999),
    174 D.L.R. (4th) 170 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  He concluded that the remedies sought did not preclude the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario court from taking jurisdiction.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Having
    determined that the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario court had jurisdiction over the remedies, the motion judge turned
    to the question of whether the court should assume jurisdiction over the
    non-Ontario defendants (paras. 35-53).  In making that determination, he
    considered and applied the factors identified in <i>Muscutt v. Courcelles</i> (2002),
    60 O.R. (3d) 20 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  The motion judge concluded that the action did have a real and substantial
    connection to
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario warranting the assumption of jurisdiction by an
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario court.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    take a somewhat different approach to the jurisdictional question, but arrive
    at the same result.  I do not favour the two-stage analysis engaged in by
    the motion judge in which he first considered jurisdiction based on the nature
    of the remedy sought and then turned to the broader question of the sufficiency
    of the connection of the action to Ontario to justify the assumption of jurisdiction
    over non-Ontario defendants.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Catania</i> was not a case of assumed jurisdiction.  The respondents in
    <st1:City w:st="on">

    <st1:City w:st="on">

    the efforts began in <i>Morguard Investments Ltd. De Savoye</i>, [1990] 3
    S.C.R. 1077 to bring various jurisdictional rules together within the real
    and substantial connection framework.  Where an
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario court is asked to assume jurisdiction over a non-Ontario defendant,
    the real and substantial connection inquiry should be the exclusive means
    used to determine jurisdiction.  </p>

line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    nature of the remedy sought in the action, particularly if the remedy relates
    to a foreign immovable such as land, will play an important and sometimes
    even determinative role in the application of the real and substantial connection
    test.  However, remedy related considerations, such as those identified in
    the four-part test in <i>Catania</i>, should be considered within the broader
    context of the various factors identified as relevant to the real and substantial
    connection test: see <i>Khan Resources Inc. v. W.M. Mining Company</i> (2006),
    79 O.R. (3d) 411 at paras. 7-10 (

    see no analytical advantage, where as in this case and
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <i>Catania</i> <i>in personam</i> jurisdiction is asserted, in conducting
    a discrete jurisdictional inquiry based upon the nature of the remedy sought.  Furthermore,
    treating the criteria in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <i>Catania</i> as distinct from the broader jurisdictional inquiry mandated
    by the real and substantial connection test creates a problem.  The first
    of the four criteria set down in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    <i>Catania</i> provides:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>The court must

    <i>Catania</i> factors, there is no reason to think that his analysis would

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Catania</i>.  In challenging his conclusion that the remedies sought did
    not preclude the assumption of jurisdiction in Ontario, the appellants contended
    that an Ontario court would have no ability to supervise the execution of
    the judgment, as that judgment related to the transfer of foreign shares
    or foreign land to the plaintiff.  Like the motion judge, I do not agree
    that the assumption of <i>in personam</i> jurisdiction depends on the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario court’s actual ability to order the transfer ownership of foreign
    property.  The motion judge put it correctly at para. 29:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>There is no barrier
    to this court’s supervising the execution of the judgment.  It bears emphasizing,
    in light of the defendants’ arguments, that this factor does not require

    must be carried out according to the requirements of foreign law, whatever

    also see no error in the motion judge’s analysis of the <i>Muscutt</i> factors.  I
    would, however, make one observation, that in my view fortifies the correctness
    of the decision reached by the motion judge.  At para. 38 of his reasons,
    the motion judge described Smith’s connection with
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario as “more tenuous”.  There can be no quarrel with this description
    insofar as it compares Smith’s connection to
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario with that of Peebles.  I do not, however, think that this comparison
    is particularly germane to the jurisdictional inquiry.  </p>

    had a potentially significant connection to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario.  On the plaintiff’s allegations, he received confidential information
    from the plaintiff, an

    only if by clearly establishing that some other jurisdiction, presumably
    England, was a more appropriate forum than Ontario, the forum chosen by the
    plaintiff:  <i>Achem Products Inc. v. British Columbia (Workers’ Compensation

    surprisingly, the appellants’ submissions in support of their <i>forum</i> <i>non</i> <i>conveniens</i> argument
    track some of their jurisdictional arguments.  The appellants placed considerable
    reliance on the submission that the motion judge mischaracterized the plaintiff’s
    action when he failed to appreciate that, in essence, it involved an allegation
    of breaches of a number of contracts, most of which contained provisions

    of these breaches are made manifest in various documents, including some
    of the agreements relied on by the appellants.  The exclusive jurisdiction
