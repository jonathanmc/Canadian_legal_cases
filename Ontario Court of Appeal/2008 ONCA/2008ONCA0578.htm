    offences arising out of three vicious sexual assaults that occurred between
    October 1998 and February 1999.<a href="#_ftn2"

'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  There were a number of similarities among the
    three assaults and forensic DNA comparisons established that the same person
    committed all three crimes.  In all three
    attacks, the female victims were abducted by a young black stranger who forced
    them into a van.  He drove the van a
    short distance, sexually assaulted the victims and then released them.  In all three cases, the victims were
    threatened with death, strangled and sexually violated in various ways.  The attacks demonstrated a level of brutality
    and callousness towards the victims that was remarkable even in the context of
    a serious sexual assault.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Identity was the sole issue at trial.  The Crown relied on expert evidence comparing
    the appellant’s DNA retrieved from a saliva sample he had given to the police with
    DNA retrieved from vaginal swabs taken from each of the three victims.  The Crown relied on similar evidence comparing
    the appellant’s DNA sample with DNA found in semen samples taken from two of
    the three stolen vans.  The expert
    evidence led by the Crown comparing these samples offered potentially very
    strong evidence that the appellant committed the assaults.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Crown also led circumstantial evidence
    capable of connecting the appellant to one or more of the attacks.  I do not need to review this evidence.  While that evidence was not overwhelming, it
    did have potential probative value on the issue of identification.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant did not testify and did not call
    any evidence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Following the appellant’s convictions, the Crown
    received the Attorney General’s consent to proceed with an application under
    Part XXIV of the <i>Criminal Code</i> to
    have the appellant declared a dangerous offender.  During interviews with a psychiatrist
    conducted for the purposes of the dangerous offender application, the appellant
    admitted that he had attacked and sexually assaulted the three victims.  After a 23-day hearing, it was common ground
    among the experts that the appellant met the criteria to be found a dangerous
    offender.  The dispute turned on whether,
    despite the fact that the appellant met the relevant criteria, the trial judge
    should exercise his discretion and decline to find that the appellant was a
    dangerous offender.  Counsel for the
    appellant argued that other sentencing alternatives, such as a finding that the
    appellant was a long-term offender, were more appropriate in the
    circumstances.  The trial judge
    ultimately determined that the appellant was a dangerous offender and imposed
    an indeterminate sentence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant appeals from his convictions and
    the finding that he is a dangerous offender.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On the conviction appeal, the appellant raises
    two grounds.  First, he contends that his
    saliva sample was obtained in a manner that breached his rights under the <i>Charter</i>.  The appellant argues that the sample and all evidence derivative of that
    sample, including the expert evidence, should have been excluded from evidence pursuant
    to s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.  The appellant submits that without the DNA
    evidence, the Crown’s evidence was incapable of establishing beyond a
    reasonable doubt that he was the perpetrator of the offences.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The second argument on the conviction appeal
    arises out of the trial judge’s instructions with respect to the content of the
    expert DNA evidence called by the Crown.  The appellant submits that the trial judge did not adequately review the
    evidence, particularly the part of the cross-examination that the appellant
    submits significantly undermined the potential probative force of the expert’s
    testimony.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On the appeal from the finding that the appellant
    is a dangerous offender, the appellant submits that this court should revisit
    its interpretation of the word “satisfied” in s. 753.1 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> as set out in the recent
    decision of <i>R. v. F.E.D.</i> (2007), 222
    C.C.C. (3d) 373 (Ont. C.A.).  The
    appellant also takes issue with the trial judge’s findings of fact,
    particularly as they reflect his preference for the evidence of the Crown
    expert over that proffered by the defence expert.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I would not give effect to any of the arguments
    raised by the appellant.  I would dismiss
    the appeal from the convictions and from the finding that the appellant is a
    dangerous offender.  </p>
  <h1><span style='"Times New Roman"'>II.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>THE CONVICTION APPEAL</h1>
  <h3><b>(A)  The <i>Charter</i> Claim</b></h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant maintains that the saliva sample
    he gave to the police, which they used for DNA comparison purposes, was
    obtained in violation of his rights under s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>.  The appellant also
    argues that even if he gave a valid waiver of his s. 8 rights, the saliva
    sample was obtained in a manner that breached his right to counsel under s.
    10(b) of the <i>Charter</i>.  The appellant contends that the saliva sample,
    and all derivative evidence, fall within the reach of s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.  He submits that the sample and the derivative evidence are conscriptive evidence,
    that their admission into evidence rendered his trial unfair, and that the
    evidence should therefore have been excluded pursuant to s. 24(2).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Crown responds that the appellant gave his express,
    voluntary and informed consent to the taking of the saliva sample by the police.  The Crown argues that this consent takes the
    obtaining of the sample outside of the ambit of s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Crown accepts the trial judge’s finding that
    the police breached the appellant’s s. 10(b) rights before he consented to the
    taking of the saliva sample.  The Crown
    submits, however, that in the circumstances, the express informed waiver given
    by the appellant effectively severed any connection between the earlier breach
    of s. 10(b) and the subsequent giving of the saliva sample.  The Crown submits that the sample was obtained
    in a manner that did not breach the appellant’s s. 10(b) rights.</p>

    attacks that ultimately became the subject of these charges against the
    appellant caused the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    York
    and Metro Toronto police forces to form a joint task force (the “Task
    Force”).  On February 5, 1999, about two
    weeks after the third attack, the Task Force received a tip from an unidentified
    source indicating that the appellant was the perpetrator of the attacks.  The Task Force had received similar tips
    naming other individuals.  When the Task
    Force received these tips, it took steps to either eliminate the person named
    in the tip as a suspect or to establish his potential connection to the
    crimes.  One way of doing so was to
    obtain a sample of that person’s DNA and compare it to the DNA  believed to have come from the perpetrator.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On February 8, 1999, members of the Task Force decided
    to take up physical surveillance of the appellant.  The officers hoped to obtain a “throw away”
    sample of the appellant’s DNA for comparison purposes.  By a “throw away” sample, the police meant a
    sample retrieved from some item, such as a coffee cup, discarded by the
    appellant.  The physical surveillance began
    on February 9 at the appellant’s high school.  Shortly before noon, the appellant was seen entering
    a van that the police quickly determined had been stolen.  The surveillance team lost contact with the
    appellant after he drove away in the stolen van.  The officers returned to the appellant’s school
    later that afternoon, found the appellant, and arrested him on a charge of
    possession of a stolen motor vehicle.  </p>

    counsel under s. 10(b) of the <i>Charter</i> and cautioned in respect of the charge of possession of stolen property.  The police took the appellant to 32 Division,
    arriving there at 3:06 p.m.  He was once again
    given his rights under s. 10(b) of the <i>Charter</i> in respect of the possession of stolen property charge.  </p>

    in the sexual assaults investigation.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The members of the Task Force did not have reasonable
    grounds to arrest the appellant on any charge arising out of the sexual
    assaults.  They did have their suspicions
    based on the tip and the appellant’s possession of a stolen van on the day of
    his arrest.  Stolen vans had been used in
    all three sexual assaults.  In addition, the
    appellant matched the very general description of the perpetrator.  According to that very general description,
    the perpetrator was a young black male.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At about 3:15 p.m., some ten minutes after the
    appellant arrived at the police station, the police, at the appellant’s
    request, contacted duty counsel on his behalf.  The appellant was placed in the cells until about 5:15 p.m. when he
    spoke to duty counsel for about five minutes.  There does not appear to have been any attempt to take a statement from
    the appellant before he had the opportunity to speak to duty counsel.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At the time he spoke to duty counsel, the
    appellant was under arrest on the charge of possession of the stolen van.  The police had not said anything to him about
    their investigation into the sexual assaults or their interest in him as a
    suspect in those attacks.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At 5:20 p.m., after the appellant had spoken
    with duty counsel, Officers Conroy and Grinton took the appellant into an
    interview room for questioning.  The
    officers, who were not on the Task Force, wanted to find out where the
    appellant had left the stolen van he had been seen driving earlier that
    day.  Conroy and Grinton had spoken with
    the Task Force officers before commencing the interview.  They were not asked to question the appellant
    in connection with the matters being investigated by the Task Force.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Very shortly after the interview started, one of
    the officers invited the appellant to “help yourself” by telling them where he
    had left the stolen vehicle.  Crown counsel
    at trial conceded that this was an inducement rendering the rest of the
    statement involuntary and inadmissible.  The appellant then told the police where he had left the vehicle.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Conroy and Grinton terminated the interview and spoke
    with members of the Task Force.  Officers
    went to the location where the appellant said he had left the van.  They found the van at that location and
    impounded it for further investigation by the Task Force.  The appellant remained detained at 32
    Division.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The chronology now comes to the crucial
    interview.  At about 8:25 p.m., the
    appellant was moved to a different interview room.  At 8:40 p.m., Constable Hall and Constable
    Wilcox, members of the Task Force, entered that room.  They wanted to obtain the appellant’s consent
    to the taking of a saliva sample from which the police could obtain his DNA for
    the purpose of comparing it with the DNA of the perpetrator.  These officers had no interest in the stolen van
    charge on which the appellant had been arrested and was being held in custody.  When Hall and Wilcox began their interview
    with the appellant, they did not tell the appellant that he was a suspect in
    the Task Force’s investigation or that they were interested in obtaining a DNA
    sample.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This interview with the appellant was videotaped
    and a transcript of the interview is available.  I will refer to the transcript pages in describing various parts of the
    interview.  The interview with Officers
    Hall and Wilcox lasted about an hour.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When the interview began at 8:40 p.m., the
    officers did not tell the appellant that they were investigating the sexual
    assaults.  Nor did the officers advise
    the appellant of his right to counsel under s. 10(b) in connection with the sexual
    assaults.  There is no mention of the
    sexual assaults in the first 24 pages of the transcript.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The police began their interview by advising the
    appellant of the videotape procedure they were using and the reasons for
    videotaping statements given by persons in custody.  The officers next confirmed that the appellant
    had spoken to duty counsel, again without mentioning that the focus of their questioning
    would not be on the stolen van but rather on the sexual assaults.  The officers then confirmed that the
    appellant had been treated properly since his arrest, gave him the usual
    secondary caution and reviewed his personal, academic and employment history.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Officers Hall and Wilcox introduced the topic of
    the Task Force investigation of the sexual assaults at p. 25 of the
    transcript.  Officer Wilcox gave the
    appellant a copy of a “public notice” the Task Force had circulated soliciting public
    assistance in their investigation.  The
    document identified the dates of the assaults, described their location, and
    indicated that one of the assaults involved an abduction of the victim in a
    van.  The “public notice” described the
    assailant and requested public assistance.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After the appellant had read the brochure, Officer
    Hall said to him:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>We’re not talking about the vans anymore that
    anything we talk about this or anything you say about this okay is going to be
    recorded on the tapes.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In his reasons ([2000] O.J. No. 2839 (S.C.J.)),
    the trial judge found that the appellant read the notice and became aware that
    the focus of his interrogation had changed from the stolen van to the sexual
    assaults.  The trial judge said at para.
    25:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>There is no question in my mind, that the accused,
    upon reading this public notice must have immediately become aware that the
    focus of the interview had changed and that the interviewers no longer were addressing
    the question of stolen vans, but rather, were addressing their investigation in
    the aforementioned sexual assaults.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I accept the trial judge’s finding that the
    appellant knew from the time he read the notice that the police questioning would
    relate to the sexual assaults and not to the stolen van.  It is important, however, to appreciate that
    even after the appellant understood that the focus of the police interrogation had
    shifted to the sexual assaults, and after he was cautioned in respect of those
    assaults, he was still not advised of his s. 10(b) rights in respect of the sexual
    assaults.  Instead of advising him of his
    rights to counsel as it related to the sexual assaults, the officers confirmed
    that he had spoken to a lawyer after his arrest.  However, as the officers well knew, that
    communication with duty counsel occurred when the appellant understood he was
    facing charges related to the stolen van and not questioning in respect of the
    much more serious charges arising out of the Task Force investigation.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Having told the appellant that the subject
    matter of their interview was the sexual assaults, while at the same time not having
    advised him of his right to counsel in respect of those matters, Officers
    Wilcox and Hall carried on with their questioning. At p. 29 of the transcript,
    Officer Hall asked the appellant directly whether he had committed the sexual
    assaults.  The appellant said that he did
    not commit those offences.  Officer Hall asked
    “should we believe you when you tell us that?”  There followed a two-page exchange in which the officers presented some
    of their evidence to the appellant and he offered explanations for that
    evidence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At p. 31 of the transcript of the interview,
    Officer Hall again asked the appellant whether he had committed the sexual
    assaults.  The appellant again denied any
    involvement in the assaults.  The
    officers asked the appellant how he had become aware of the assaults and the
    appellant offered an explanation. Officer Hall then asked the appellant for a
    third time whether he had any knowledge of or involvement in the assaults.  For a third time, the appellant denied any
    involvement.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At p. 36 of the transcript, the officers
    introduced the possibility of the appellant providing a sample of his saliva
    for DNA purposes.  Officer Hall asked:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>What would you be prepared to do to like show us
    that you have no involvement in that?</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The officers provided a brief description of the
    procedures used to obtain a saliva sample.  They told the appellant that providing the sample was “strictly
    voluntary”.  There had still been no
    mention of the appellant’s right to counsel in the context of the sexual
    assaults investigation.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At p. 37 of the transcript, Officer Wilcox left
    the interview room and returned a short time later with a consent form and the paraphernalia
    used to obtain the saliva sample.  She
    read the entire consent form to the appellant.  The form began by referring to the three sexual assaults and the dates
    on which they had occurred.  The second
    paragraph of the form indicates:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>We’re seeking permission from you to obtain bodily
    samples … for scientific testing, including DNA analysis.  <u>The samples obtained from you will be
    scientifically tested and analyzed and compared with other evidence.  The purpose of the analysis and comparison is
    to enable investigators to attempt to positively identify the person
    responsible for the above sexual assaults and also to enable the investigators
    to eliminate persons as possible suspects.</u>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The final paragraph as read to the appellant
    contains the following:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><u>You’re not required to give us these samples.  You may refuse to provide these samples.</u>  If you agree to provide samples for analysis,
    the results of the analysis may be used against you in criminal proceedings.  <u>You may discuss this request with anyone,
    including a lawyer and you are free to do so now.</u>  [Emphasis added.]  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After reading the entire form to the appellant, Officer
    Wilcox confirmed that the appellant had spoken to duty counsel earlier in the
    day.  The appellant said that he had
    spoken to duty counsel, but not “about this stuff”.  He asked Officer Wilcox whether he should
    speak to a lawyer before giving a sample.  She responded:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><u>It’s completely up to you.  If, if you’re telling me you didn’t do this
    it’s, it’s completely up to you but you have, you know you have the right to
    speak to a lawyer right now if you wish okay.</u>  And if, we’ll just put in here the answer to
    the questions.  Do you understand what
    I’ve just read and do you have any questions?  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant confirmed that he understood what
    he had been told and that he did not have any questions.  He then asked whether he could speak to a lawyer
    after he signed the consent.  An exchange
    followed about the availability of a Legal Aid lawyer and who that lawyer might
    be.  Officer Wilcox then told the
    appellant:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I mean you’re an adult you have freedom of choice
    right now, okay.  <u>Like I say I want to
    make sure it’s, it’s fully, you consent to this.  I’m not, we’re not trying to coerce you if
    you don’t, you know if you have a problem with it let me know.</u>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant then asked, “what happens if I
    don’t do it?” The officer replied, “you don’t do it.  You, you’re not cleared though, we want to
    clear you as a suspect.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant signed the consent and Officer
    Wilcox took the saliva sample.  Officer
    Wilcox asked the appellant if he had any questions and he replied that he did
    not.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The interaction between the appellant and the
    police following the taking of the saliva sample does not require a detailed
    review.  Officers Wilcox and Hall continued
    to question the appellant.  Among other
    things, they asked him about his whereabouts at the times of the sexual
    assaults.  At 9:40 p.m., Detective Paul
    Lobsinger, the officer in charge of the Task Force, joined the interview.  He questioned the appellant vigorously for
    about 50 minutes.  At one point during the
    interrogation, the appellant asked Lobsinger why he would give a sample of his
    saliva to the police if he had committed the sexual assaults.  By the end of the interview, Lobsinger believed
    that the appellant was not the perpetrator.  Sometime after the interview with Lobsinger, Wilcox and Hall ended, the appellant
    spoke briefly with Officers Grinton and Conroy.  The appellant initiated this discussion with the officers while they were
    doing their paperwork.  The content of the
    conversation is not important.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant did not testify and did not call

style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At trial, the appellant challenged the voluntariness
    of the statements.  The trial judge found
    that the comments made in the initial interview with Grinton and Conroy after
    the officers’ inducement, were involuntary and inadmissible.  He ruled that the Crown had proved that all
    of the other statements were voluntary:  <i>R. v. Simon</i> (2000), WL 33297166 (Ont. S.C.J.).  I do not understand the Crown to rely on the
    contents of the statements.  Voluntariness
    is not an issue on appeal.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On the <i>Charter</i> motion, the trial judge held that Constables Hall and Wilcox were
    constitutionally obliged to tell the appellant that the focus of the
    questioning had changed from the stolen van to the sexual assaults.  The trial judge also held that the police
    were constitutionally obliged to advise the appellant of his s. 10(b) rights in
    the context of their investigation of the sexual assaults.  The trial judge ruled that any of the
    appellant’s statements up to p. 27 of the transcript of the interview with
    Constables Hall and Wilcox, the point at which he became aware that the focus
    of the investigation had changed, were inadmissible pursuant to s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>:  <i>R. v. Simon</i>,
    [2000] O.J. No. 2839 at para. 34 (S.C.J.).  The Crown does not take issue with that ruling.  As indicated above, the admissibility of the
    appellant’s statements is not the issue.  The real target of the <i>Charter</i> motion and this ground of appeal is the appellant’s saliva sample and the
    evidence derivative of that sample.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge held, at para. 37, that the appellant
    had given an express, informed and voluntary waiver of his <i>Charter</i> rights before agreeing to provide a sample of his saliva to
    the police for DNA comparison purposes:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I have had an opportunity to observe the accused
    during these lengthy proceedings and I also had an opportunity to see and hear
    him in the course of the many videotaped statements that were produced on those <i>voir dires</i>.  I have had an opportunity to review the agreed
    statement of facts revealing a very lengthy experience the accused has with the
    minions of the law.  <u>I have formed an
    opinion that he is a very highly intelligent and articulate individual and I am
    more than convinced that the Crown has discharged its onus in satisfying me
    that “the accused had decided to relinquish his constitutional right with full
    knowledge of their existence and full appreciation of the consequences of
    waiving those rights”.</u>  I am more
    than satisfied that “he exercised a right to choose voluntarily and that his
    decision was informed and that he made a valid and effective choice”.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <h3><b><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></b><b>Analysis</b></h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There are two distinct but related <i>Charter</i> claims that must be
    addressed.  The first turns on whether
    the appellant effectively waived his rights under s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i> before providing his saliva
    sample to the police.  The second
    argument turns on whether in the circumstances that waiver, which was made with
    full knowledge of the right to speak to counsel before giving the waiver,
    severed any connection between the providing of the sample by the appellant, and
    the prior breach of his s. 10(b) rights so that it could not be said that the
    sample was obtained in a manner that infringed s. 10(b).  </p>
  <h3><b>(a)  The Section 8 Claim</b></h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section 8 of the <i>Charter</i> protects individuals against unwarranted state intrusions
    upon their privacy interests.  One of the
    values animating the right protected by s. 8 is personal autonomy.  Personal autonomy, however, also dictates
    that an individual must be able to waive his or her right to be left alone by
    the state and to consent to what, absent that consent, would be an unreasonable
    state invasion of personal privacy.  If
    an individual provides that consent, what would otherwise be a search or seizure,
    is no longer a search or seizure.  The
    reasonableness standard mandated by s. 8 has no application where the
    individual has consented to the state intrusion upon his or her privacy:  <i>R. v.
    Dyment</i> (1988), 45 C.C.C. (3d) 244 at 257 (S.C.C.);  <i>R. v. Borden</i> (1994), 92 C.C.C. (3d) 404 (S.C.C.);  <i>R. v. Wills</i> (1992), 70 C.C.C. (3d) 529 at

style='"Times New Roman"'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The quality of a purported s. 8 waiver must be commensurate
    with the importance of the right being relinquished.  Courts will be slow to infer a waiver, particularly
    where the individual who is said to have waived his or her s. 8 rights is detained
    and is the target of a criminal investigation.  The Crown bears the burden of demonstrating that any waiver relied on by
    the Crown is in all of the circumstances an effective and informed waiver of an
    individual’s s. 8 rights.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The validity of a waiver is a fact-bound
    inquiry.  The factors to be considered
    have been reviewed in a number of authorities: see, e.g., <i>R. v. Wills</i>, <i>supra</i>, and <i>R. v. Borden</i>, <i>supra</i>.  The trial judge was
    alive to these authorities.  The appellant
    does not suggest that the trial judge misstated the law as it applies to waivers
    of s. 8 rights.  I do not propose to restate
    the principles to be derived from those well-known authorities.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge found that the appellant’s waiver
    of his s. 8 rights met the high standard required by the case law.  The appellant has not convinced me that the
    trial judge made any reversible error in coming to that conclusion. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I start with the obvious.  The appellant gave an express written consent
    to the taking of the sample.  This is not
    a case where the trial judge was asked to infer consent from conduct or to rely
    on an unrecorded oral waiver.  There is nothing
    ambiguous in the language of the written document.  Nor did the police say or do anything that could
    qualify the contents of the document or render its subject matter ambiguous or
    unclear.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The consent was also voluntary in the sense that
    it was the product of the appellant’s own free will.  He chose to give the consent.  There was no unfair or oppressive police
    conduct that could negate the appellant’s exercise of his own free will.  He knew, because he was repeatedly told, that
    he did not have to give the sample and he chose to give it.  </p>

    in all meaningful ways.  He knew he was a
    suspect in the investigation of three serious sexual assaults.  He knew the police would use the sample by
    comparing it with the samples connected to the crimes.  He knew that if the samples “matched”, they
    would provide strong evidence that he committed the sexual assaults and that if
    they did not match, he would be eliminated as a suspect.  The appellant was also told exactly how the
    police proposed to take the sample.  In
    short, the appellant knew what the police wanted, why they wanted it, the jeopardy
    to which he was exposed, and how the police proposed to take the sample.  </p>

    relates to s. 8 is directed not at the trial judge’s statement of the
    applicable legal principles, but rather at the trial judge’s assessment of the
    evidence.  The appellant submits that the
    trial judge inferred a valid consent based on the trial judge’s observations of
    the appellant on the videotape, and his familiarity with the criminal
    investigative process based on his prior experience.  The appellant submits that the trial judge
    should not have drawn these inferences from the appellant’s conduct on the
    videotape in the absence of any testimony from the appellant.  </p>

    judge’s reasons.  The trial judge relied
    on what he saw on the videotape to form certain impressions of the appellant.  Those impressions were, however, only part of
    the total evidentiary picture.  The
    evidence that was most germane to the validity of the waiver was not in
    dispute.  That evidence came from the actual
    exchanges between the police and the appellant as captured on the videotape and
    the contents of the document that the appellant signed.  The real factual dispute arose over whether
    on the undisputed evidence, the appellant’s apparent consent was in reality a
    valid and effective consent to the taking of the saliva sample.  </p>

    use videotaping when questioning suspects.  One of the values of videotaping is that it gives trial judges the
    opportunity to see exactly what happened when statements were made and to see
    the interaction between the police and the suspect.  The videotape provides valuable insights that
    no mere verbal description of the encounter could provide.  I see no reason to limit the use of the
    potentially valuable insights gained from the videotape to cases in which an
    accused chooses to testify on the <i>voir

    certain impressions of the appellant and he did use those impressions in coming
    to his conclusion that the waiver was valid.  Indeed, I think he would have fallen into serious error had he not taken
    into account what he saw on the videotape and the reasonable inferences about
    the appellant available from looking at the videotape.  The trial judge’s findings that the appellant

    p.m. that the focus of the questioning was shifting from the stolen van to the
    sexual assaults and that the appellant had a right to speak with counsel before
    being questioned about the sexual assaults:  see <i>R. v. Evans</i> (1991), 63
    C.C.C. (3d) 289 at 306-307 (S.C.C.);  <i>R. v. Sawatsky </i>(1997), 118 C.C.C. (3d)

    did neither.  Although they eventually
    made it clear to the appellant that they were concerned with the sexual
    assaults and not the stolen van, they never expressly told him that he had a
    right to speak to a lawyer before being questioned about the sexual assaults.  </p>

    appellant’s effective waiver of his s. 8 rights prior to giving the saliva
    sample rendered the sample admissible.  The trial judge did not consider the impact of the prior breach of s.
    10(b) on the admissibility of the sample.  On the controlling jurisprudence, he was obligated to determine whether there
    was a sufficient connection between the appellant’s giving of the saliva sample
    and the s. 10(b) breach to render the sample potentially inadmissible under s.
    24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>:  see <i>R.

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is helpful to begin with the relevant words
    of s. 24(2):</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Where … a court concludes that evidence <u>was
    obtained in a manner that infringed or denied any rights or freedoms guaranteed
    by this <i>Charter</i></u>, the evidence
    shall be excluded if it is established that having regard to all the

    administration of justice into disrepute.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Evidence is potentially inadmissible under s.
    24(2) only if it was obtained “in a manner” that infringed a right or freedom
    guaranteed by the <i>Charter</i>.  If the threshold requirement is met, the
    ultimate determination of admissibility turns on whether the admission of the
    evidence could bring the administration of justice into disrepute.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Since <i>R.
    v. Strachan</i> (1988), 46 C.C.C. (3d) 479 (S.C.C.), the courts have taken a
    generous view of the kind of connection needed between the <i>Charter</i> breach and the evidence to satisfy the threshold
    requirement in s. 24(2).  The connection
    may be temporal, causal, contextual, or a combination of the three:  <i>R. v.
    Wittwer</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para. 21.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On the generous approach favoured in the case
    law, there is something to be said for the appellant’s submission that the s.
    10(b) breach was sufficiently connected to the sample to bring the sample within
    the reach of s. 24(2).  There was a very
    close temporal connection between the breach and the giving of the sample.  Both occurred in the same interview which, by
    the time the sample was given, had gone on for about 40 minutes.  That interview which encompassed both the <i>Charter</i> breach and the giving of the
    sample was conducted by the same officers in the same place.  The officers had the same agenda throughout
    the interview.  They were investigating
    the sexual assaults and they wanted to obtain the appellant’s consent to the
    giving of a saliva sample.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The s. 10(b) breach and the giving of the sample
    must be regarded as part of the “same transaction or course of conduct”:  see <i>R.
    v. Wittwer</i>, <i>supra</i>, para. 21.  I think that unless something occurred during
    that course of conduct which clearly severed the s. 10(b) breach from the
    taking of the sample, s. 24(2) would be engaged when the Crown sought to
    introduce the saliva sample and the evidence derivative of that sample.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I would add that despite the close temporal and
    contextual connection, I see no causal connection.  Nothing said or done by the police in the
    course of their interview subsequent to the s. 10(b) breach affected the appellant’s
    ultimate decision to provide the saliva sample.  Unlike in <i>R. v. Wittwer</i>, <i>supra</i>, at para. 26, there is no evidence
    that the police knowingly and deliberately used constitutionally tainted
    information to obtain the appellant’s consent to the giving of the saliva
    sample.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ultimately, the sufficiency of the connection between
    the <i>Charter</i> breach and the subsequent
    obtaining of the evidence for the purposes of engaging s. 24(2) can only be
    determined by a case-specific factual inquiry:  see <i>R. v. Plaha</i>, <i>supra</i>, para. 47.  As Fish J. noted in <i>R. v. Wittwer</i>, <i>supra</i>, at
    para. 3, the police can, where an interrogation is tainted by a <i>Charter</i> breach, make a “permissible
    fresh start” by clearly severing their subsequent interrogation from the effect
    of the earlier <i>Charter</i> breach.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The facts of this case present a somewhat
    different scenario than the other cases referred to by counsel.  Here, the significant evidence is not a
    statement made by the appellant after a belated police compliance with s.
    10(b), but is rather a saliva sample obtained from the appellant under the
    authority of the appellant’s express consent to the taking of the sample.  That consent was given after the appellant
    was told, both orally and in writing, that he was not required to provide the
    sample and that he could speak to a lawyer right away and before he made any
    decision.  On the unchallenged evidence,
    the officers administered a focussed and powerful antidote to their earlier s.
    10(b) breach.  That antidote targeted a
    single piece of evidence – the saliva sample.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A determination of whether the police conduct
    surrounding the waiver effectively disconnected the prior s. 10(b) breach from
    the giving of the saliva sample requires a consideration of the impact of that
    police conduct on the purposes underlying the rights created by s. 10(b).  The right to counsel exists in large measure
    to ensure that detained persons are treated fairly.  A detained person must be made aware of his
    or her right to counsel before being questioned by the police so that the
    detained person might make an informed decision as to whether to speak to
    counsel and obtain legal advice before potentially incriminating him or herself
    in response to police questioning.  Access
    to counsel protects detained persons against uninformed self-incrimination.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Insofar as providing the saliva sample is concerned,
    the purposes underlying s. 10(b) were fully served by the information provided
    to the appellant before he chose to consent to the giving of the sample.  The appellant knew the nature and extent of his
    jeopardy when he agreed to give the sample.  He appreciated the potential for
    self-incrimination and his entitlement to either refuse outright to provide the
    sample or to speak to a lawyer before making that decision.  Whatever may be said about the appellant’s
    understanding of his circumstances in the broader context of any statements he
    may have made to the police, when he consented to the taking of the saliva sample,
    he had a full appreciation of his right to counsel in regard to the taking of
    that sample and the potential value of that right to him.  The appellant chose to go ahead without
    speaking to counsel.    </p>

    of his s. 10(b) rights as they related to the providing the sample, drives a
    wedge between the giving of the sample and the earlier breach of s. 10(b).  The informed consent effectively disconnected
    the decision to give the sample from any potential effect of the prior s. 10(b)
    breach.  It cannot be said that the
    sample was obtained in a manner that violated the appellant’s rights under s.
    10(b) of the <i>Charter</i>.  Consequently, the evidence does not pass the
    threshold inquiry required under s. 24(2) and the s. 10(b) breach cannot

    jury that it should “not be bowled over” by the opinion of the expert.  The trial judge went so far as to tell the
    jury that it was not “safe” to convict on the evidence of an expert alone.  All of these instructions inured to the

    trial, stems from the trial judge’s decision not to review the evidence of the
    expert concerning the statistical likelihood of a coincidental match like the
    match he had found.  No doubt, the trial
    judge was concerned that the numbers attached to the possibility of a
    coincidental match by the expert (more than six billion to one) could overwhelm
    the jury and prejudice the appellant.</p>

    cross-examination of the expert.  He
    submits that the cross-examination provided a basis upon which the jury could
    infer that the chances of a coincidental match between the appellant’s sample
    and those of the perpetrator were far greater than the virtually non-existent
    possibility that the expert had suggested during his examination-in-chief.  The appellant submits that the trial judge was
    required to review this part of the cross-examination with the jury in the
    context of assisting the jury in evaluating the probative value of the expert’s
    evidence that the sample taken from the appellant “matched” the samples left by
    the perpetrator.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Trial judges do not and should not reargue cases
    for the Crown or the defence.  They are
    not obliged in their closing instructions to marshal all of the evidence or all
    of the arguments that could assist one side or the other.  The appellant’s complaint has merit only if a
    review of the relevant part of the cross-examination was crucial to a jury’s
    proper understanding of the defence position.</p>

    cross-examination had the potential dramatic effect suggested by the
    appellant.  The expert, whose evidence
    was unchallenged by any other expert, made it abundantly clear that the
    comparison presented to him by counsel on cross-examination represented an
    entirely different kind of comparison than the one he had made.  His was random; the one used by counsel was
    not.  As far as the expert was concerned,
    counsel was comparing “apples to oranges”.  The expert explained at some length why the comparison brought up on
    cross-examination was of no assistance in evaluating the chances that the matches
    he identified were coincidental.  </p>

    area of the evidence with the jury, he would have had to canvass the entirety
    of the expert’s evidence as it related to this topic, including his evidence as
    to the invalidity of the comparison relied on by counsel.  As there was no expert evidence contradicting
    the Crown’s expert’s explanation for the invalidity of the comparison, it seems
    doubtful that the jury would have rejected the expert’s explanation for the
    invalidity of the comparison.  This part
    of the cross-examination was simply one feature of the evidence.  The trial judge could have reminded the jury
    of this evidence, but his failure to do so does not come close to reversible
    error.</p>

    that there was an onus on the Crown to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that
    there was no reasonable possibility for eventual control of the risk posed by
    the offender.  She did not read the
    section as imposing an onus on either party stating at para. 50:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In the context of a dangerous offender application,
    the issue is whether the sentencing judge should exercise the discretion not to
    declare an offender dangerous after the sentencing judge has found that the
    offender satisfies the statutory criteria for that designation.  As I have explained, the sentence judge may
    exercise that discretion where he or she is satisfied that the public threat
    can be reduced to an acceptable level through either the long term offender
    provisions or a determinate sentence.  This is not an issue that requires either party to satisfy a burden of
    proof; rather, it is an issue for the sentencing judge concerning whether to
    exercise his or her discretion based on the whole of the evidence adduced …</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The <i>stare
    decisis</i> doctrine imposes important judicial discipline, especially on a large
    intermediate appellate court that sits in panels of three judges.  Mere disagreement with the analysis or the
    legal conclusion reached by another panel in an earlier case cannot justify
    overruling that earlier decision.  Where
    a party seeks to have this court overrule an earlier decision of the court, that
    party must go beyond the merits of the particular decision and demonstrate
    cogent policy reasons for departing from the <i>stare decisis</i> principle.  The
    appellant has offered no reason for this court to reconsider a decision
    rendered only a year ago.  In any event,
    I agree with and adopt the reasoning of Simmons J.A. in <i>R. v. F.E.D.</i></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On the authority of <i>R. v. F.E.D.</i>, the trial judge did not err in his application of s.
    753.1.  He was clearly not “satisfied
    that the very real risk posed by the appellant could eventually be controlled
    in the community”.  This finding finds
    ample support in the opinion of Dr. Woodside and the conduct of the appellant.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The remaining arguments advanced on this aspect
    of the appeal challenge the trial judge’s preference for the evidence of Dr.
    Woodside over that of Dr. Federoff in the areas where their evidence
    conflicted.  Both doctors are recognized
    experts.  This court must defer to the
    trial judge’s assessment of their opinions absent clear and material factual
    errors or an unreasonable determination.  Neither occurred here.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge was alive to the differences in
    the opinions the two experts advanced and carefully considered those
    differences.  For example, while both
    doctors diagnosed the appellant as suffering from an anti-social personality
    disorder, Dr. Woodside also opined that he was a sexual sadist with a
    preference for a non-consenting course of sexual activity.  Dr. Federoff was uncertain about whether the
    evidence demonstrated that the appellant was a sadist or had a preference for
    non-consenting sexual activity.  Their
    difference of opinions stemmed in large measure from their somewhat different
    interpretations of the facts underlying the predicate offences.  The trial judge spent some 30 paragraphs
    outlining the differences in the doctors’ opinions and examining the evidence
    underlying those opinions.  His reasons
    provide ample support for his preference for Dr. Woodside’s diagnosis insofar as
    it related to sexual sadism and the appellant’s demonstrated preference for
    non-consensual sexual activity.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I will refer to two additional submissions made
    on the appellant’s behalf.  He argues
    that because he had never undergone or rejected psychiatric treatment prior to
    the dangerous offender proceedings, that Dr. Woodside’s opinion that he was
    untreatable must be taken to be unreasonable.  The appellant refers to authorities that he says support the contention
    that failed or refused treatment is a prerequisite to a finding that a person
    is essentially untreatable:  see <i>R. v. Ryan</i>, [2004] N.J. No. 2 at para.
    49 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    );  <i>R. v.
    D.L.S.</i>, [2002] B.C.J. No. 2569 at para. 92 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region

    ).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Nothing in the language Parliament used in the
    dangerous offender provisions suggests that failed or refused treatment is a
    precondition to a dangerous offender designation.  The trial judge thoroughly canvassed the
    evidence relevant to the appellant’s treatment prospects.  He was alive to the fact that the appellant
    had not undergone a previous treatment regime aimed at the problems identified
    by Drs. Woodside and Federoff.  He noted
    the absence of prior treatment (para. 244) when summarizing Dr. Woodside’s
    evidence to the effect that the appellant posed a substantial risk to the safety
    of the community that could not be controlled within the community.  Like the trial judge, I see the absence of
    prior treatment efforts as relevant to, but in no way determinative of, the
    assessment that the trial judge had to make.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant also submits that in preferring
    the evidence of Dr. Woodside, the trial judge improperly focussed on the
    treatability of the appellant rather than the controllability of the appellant in
    the community at some future time.  The
    two concepts seem to me to be inextricably linked.  Absent some kind of effective treatment – and
    of course I do not suggest a “cure” – it is difficult to see how the appellant
    could be safely controlled in the community absent what would amount to the
    equivalent of incarceration.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant’s treatment prospects were
    addressed at length in the evidence and in counsel’s submissions.  The attention paid to his treatment prospects
    indicates that all parties saw those prospects as a key consideration in
    determining whether the appellant could eventually be controlled within the
    community.  The trial judge analyzed the
    future controllability of the appellant in the community in the same terms that
    it was presented to him in the evidence and the argument.  The appellant’s treatability played a key
    role in this assessment.  The trial judge
    did not err in focusing on treatability when considering the possibilities of
    effectively controlling the appellant within the community at some future point
    in time.</p>

    situation like that presented in this case,  one could accept that any evidence following the s. 10(b) breach was
    obtained in a manner that breached s. 10(b) thereby bringing it within s.
    24(2).  The subsequent compliance with s.
    10(b) before the sample was given would be relevant to the question of whether
    the admission of the sample into evidence would render the trial unfair by
    virtue of the conscriptive nature of the evidence despite the fact that by the
    time the appellant provided the sample, he was aware of his right to
    counsel.  I think there is much to be
    said for this approach, but at least at present, it seems foreclosed by binding
    authority:  see <i>R. v. Wittwer</i>, <i>supra</i>.</p>
