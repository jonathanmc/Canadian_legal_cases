    Crown appeal from the respondent’s acquittal on drug and related charges
    by Sheppard J. raises issues concerning the use of the investigative detention
    power.  In this case, rather than staying to answer questions from the police
    officer, the respondent ran away and took other evasive actions in an attempt
    to avoid questioning.  The police gave chase and the respondent threw his
    knapsack away during the chase.  The trial judge found that since the officers
    had no grounds to detain the respondent when he fled, all of their subsequent
    actions in chasing the respondent, apprehending him and retrieving and opening
    the knapsack, which contained contraband, violated his rights under the <i>Canadian
    Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>.  The trial judge accordingly excluded
    all of the evidence found by the police and the respondent was acquitted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the following reasons, it is my view that the trial judge erred in law in
    finding that the respondent’s rights were violated.  While I agree with the
    trial judge that the police did not have grounds to detain the respondent
    when they initially encountered him, at that point he was not detained.  The
    respondent’s subsequent actions gave the officers grounds to detain, if not
    arrest, him.  Finally, by throwing his knapsack away, the respondent abandoned
    any reasonable expectation of privacy in the knapsack and its contents.  The
    police therefore did not violate the respondent’s rights by opening the bag
    and discovering the contraband inside it.</p>

  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'>THE FACTS</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Around
    11:00 p.m. on January 28, 2006, six police officers working on a strategy
    referred to as the Toronto Anti-Violence Intervention Strategy (TAVIS) went
    to an apartment complex in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Scarborough.  The officers described the complex as one plagued by drug use,
    drug sales, robberies, guns and gang violence.  The purpose of TAVIS is to
    reduce violence and increase safety.  The officers understood that they had
    the consent of the landlord to attend at the complex to enforce the <i>Trespass
    to Property Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. T.21.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    they arrived, the officers split into three teams with each team walking
    up one of the three stairwells.  The incident involved in this case began
    on the north stairwell.  The two officers in that stairwell testified that
    they immediately detected a strong odour of freshly smoked marijuana.  When
    the officers reached the 9<sup>th</sup> floor landing, the landing door opened
    and the respondent entered.  The respondent seemed surprised when he saw
    the officers and immediately very tightly clenched the knapsack that he was
    carrying.  One of the officers asked the respondent, “Hey buddy, what are
    you doing?”  The respondent replied, “Oh shit”, turned around, opened the
    door and began to run.  The officers ran after him across the 9<sup>th</sup> floor.  On
    the way, the respondent grabbed a shopping cart and attempted to knock it
    over in front of one of the pursuing officers.  The pursuing officers were
    repeatedly yelling:  “Stop, police.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent ran to the west stairwell and proceeded downstairs.  As he ran
    down the stairs the respondent threw the knapsack to the ground where it
    was retrieved by one of the two other officers who had been patrolling the
    west stairwell.  His partner chased the respondent on to the 7<sup>th</sup> floor,
    eventually caught up to him and tackled him to the ground.  One of the original
    pursuing officers then took the knapsack and opened it.  Inside, the officer
    found a quantity of cocaine (680 grams), two digital scales and three cell
    phones.  The officer detaining the respondent thereupon put the respondent
    under arrest for possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking.  The
    officer searched the respondent and found $1,720 in cash.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent was charged with possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking,
    possession of the proceeds of crime and failing to comply with the terms
    of a recognizance.</p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'>THE TRIAL JUDGE’S RULING</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge made two sets of findings that were critical to his holding that
    the respondent’s rights were violated.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first findings related to the initiation of the pursuit.  The trial judge
    found that none of the officers were able to provide an articulable cause
    for the “attempt to detain the accused” by uttering the words, “stop, police”.  This
    utterance was clearly a command with which the officer expected the respondent
    to comply.  The fact that it was a high crime area, that the officers smelled
    marijuana, and that the respondent appeared startled, swore and then ran,
    while suspicious, did not constitute “articulable cause to believe any crime
    had occurred or was just in the process of [occurring]”.  The trial judge
    held there was no justification for the chase and the ultimate tackle of
    the respondent.  Since the attempt to detain the respondent was based on
    suspicion and hunch and not articulable cause, the respondent’s right under
    s. 9 of the <i>Charter of Rights and Freedoms </i>to protection against arbitrary
    detention was violated.  The trial judge also held that there were no grounds
    to arrest the respondent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second set of findings relate to the knapsack.  The trial judge held that “there
    were no extrinsic circumstances to warrant the opening of the knapsack”.  He
    also stated that the officers “knew they were not dealing with lost property
    or abandoned property in the classic sense that someone puts something out
    curbside for the garbage”.  The search of the backpack was therefore a violation
    of the respondent’s right to protection against unreasonable search and seizure
    under s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    found violations of the respondent’s rights under ss. 8 and 9, the trial
    judge turned to s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter.</i>  He held that the violations
    were “so fundamental that they leave this court with concerns that the extraordinary
    measures of an Anti-Violence Task Force somehow [were] allowed to supersede
    normal constitutional and <i>Charter</i> protections”.  He also had doubt
    as to the good faith of the officers.  In his view, the administration of
    justice would be brought into disrepute if the evidence was not excluded.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Without
    the evidence of the cocaine and the cash, the Crown’s case collapsed and
    the respondent was acquitted of all charges.</p>

line-height:normal;page-break-after:avoid'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R.
      v. Mann </i>(2004)<i>, </i>185 C.C.C. (3d) 308<span lang=EN> at para. 16,
      the Supreme Court of Canada noted that “police officers must be empowered
      to respond quickly, effectively, and flexibly to the diversity of encounters
      experienced daily on the front lines of policing”.  This is a classic case
      of police officers faced with a rapidly evolving situation to which they
      attempted to respond quickly and effectively.  In <i>Mann</i>, the court
      recognized a limited power of investigative detention to assist police
      in carrying out their duties in circumstances such as this.  A police officer
      may briefly detain an individual for investigative purposes “if there are
      reasonable grounds to suspect in all the circumstances that the individual
      is connected to a particular crime and that such a detention is necessary”:
      at para. 45.  Such a detention will not violate s. 9.  In this case, the
      trial judge found that when the police initiated the chase and gave the
      respondent the command to stop, they did not have the requisite reasonable
      grounds to detain and therefore violated his rights.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN>In
      my view, the trial judge erred in failing to consider whether the respondent
      was detained when the chase began.  As I read his reasons, the trial judge
      never found that the respondent was detained until he was tackled by one
      of the officers.  Prior to that, the trial judge spoke in terms of an attempt
      to detain.  Until the respondent was detained, his s. 9 rights were not
      triggered.  The courts have recognized that an individual can be detained
      within the meaning of s. 9 either because the person has been physically
      detained or subject to psychological detention.  When the police chase
      began, the respondent was not physically detained.  Nor, in my view, was
      he psychologically detained. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN>In <i>R.
        v. Grant</i> (2006), 209 C.C.C. (3d) 250 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) at para. 28, Laskin J.A. explained that psychological detention includes
    three elements:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>a
      police direction or demand to an individual; <i>the individual's voluntary
      compliance with the direction or demand, resulting in a deprivation of
      liberty</i> or other serious legal consequences; and the individual’s reasonable
      belief that there is no choice but to comply. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, while there was a demand:  “Stop, police”, the element of compliance
    with the demand was missing.  Far from complying, the respondent made it
    abundantly clear that he had no intention of being detained.  While the police
    obviously intended to detain the respondent after he began to flee, as the
    court said in <i>R. v. Clayton</i> (2007), 220 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (S.C.C.) at
    para. 48: “Intention alone does not attract a finding of unconstitutionality.”  Thus,
    there was no detention at the start of the pursuit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the respondent was not detained until he was tackled at the end
    of the chase.  The validity of that detention had to be measured by the facts
    known to the police at that time.  Those facts included the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent had immediately bolted when he saw the uniformed officers.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>He
    used some force in an attempt to impede the officers’ progress by throwing
    a shopping cart in their way.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>He
    threw away a knapsack that he had been tightly holding up until then.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    was late at night, and the respondent was in the stairwell of a building
    known to be a high-crime area.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    constellation of factors was sufficient to give the police officers reasonable
    grounds to suspect that the respondent was involved in criminal conduct.  These
    were not the actions of a mere trespasser. While the court in <i>Mann</i> speaks
    of reasonable grounds to suspect that the individual is connected to “a particular
    crime”, in my view, it is not necessary that the officers be able to pinpoint
    the crime with absolute precision.  Given the respondent’s behaviour in relation
    to the knapsack and the desperation with which he fled the police, the police
    could reasonably suspect that he was in possession of contraband: either
    drugs or weapons or both.  They were therefore entitled to detain him for
    investigation in accordance with <i>Mann.</i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    leaving the detention issue, I note that there is one possible gap in the
    evidence.  None of the police officers actually articulated in their evidence
    why they detained the respondent.  Perhaps they thought it was obvious given
    the rapid unfolding of events: the pursuit and the almost simultaneous discovery
    of the contraband in the knapsack.  In <i>R. v. Storrey</i> (1990)<i>,</i> 53
    C.C.C. (3d) 316 (S.C.C.) at 324, the court held that for an arrest to be
    valid the officer must have both a subjective belief in reasonable and probable
    grounds to arrest and those grounds must be objectively established.  It
    may be that the same form of analysis should apply to a <i>Mann</i> investigative
    detention: see <i>R. v. Simpson</i> (1993), 79 C.C.C. (3d) 482 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>

line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, I have found that the officers objectively had reasonable grounds
    to detain the respondent, even though none of them articulated their subjective
    belief as to the grounds.  While it would have been helpful had the officers
    expressly testified to their grounds for detaining the respondent, the court
    is entitled to draw reasonable inferences from the circumstances.  In my
    view, it is apparent that the officers believed that they had grounds to
    detain the respondent by the time the chase ended.  </p>

    trial judge held that the seizure and opening of the knapsack without a warrant
    was an unreasonable search and seizure contrary to s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>.  In
    my view, however, the trial judge erred in failing to consider whether the
    respondent had a reasonable expectation of privacy in the knapsack at the
    time the police seized and opened it.  In <i>R. v. Edwards</i> (1996), 104
    C.C.C. (3d) 136 (S.C.C.) at para. 45, Cory J. listed seven factors a court
    should consider in determining whether the accused has a reasonable expectation
    of privacy in the totality of the circumstances:</p>

      all factors will be applicable in any particular case and some will be
      more important than others. Three factors stand out in this case to demonstrate
      that there was no reasonable expectation of privacy in the knapsack.  Far
      from having possession or control of the knapsack, the respondent attempted
      to divest himself of possession and control.  He gave up the ability to
      regulate access to the property when he threw it away.  Finally, he offered
      no evidence of any subjective expectation of privacy; to the contrary,
      the trial judge accepted that the respondent intentionally threw the knapsack
      away, which suggests that he was no longer interested in exercising any
      privacy interest in the knapsack.  </span></p>

      circumstances of this case bear some similarity to the decision of this
      court in <i>R. v. B. (L.)</i> (2007), 227 C.C.C. (3d) 70.  In that case,
      the accused was on school property and seen to be holding a bag when the
      police initially saw him. However, when the accused approached the officers,
      he was no longer carrying the bag.  One of the officers retrieved the bag
      and asked the accused, “whose bag is this”.  The accused responded that
      he did not know.  The court held, at para. 71, that by this answer the
      accused had “disclaimed any privacy interest in the bag” and thus “effectively
      precluded himself from relying on s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>”.  The same
      may be said here.  By his conduct in intentionally throwing away the knapsack,
      the respondent had precluded himself from relying on the s. 8 protection.  In
      fairness, the trial judge did not have the benefit of the <i>B.&nbsp;(L.)</i> decision,
      which was decided several months after this trial.</span></p>

    the respondent’s s. 8 rights were not engaged in this case, the seizure and
    search of the bag was not unlawful.  Once the officers opened the bag and
    found the drugs, they had reasonable grounds to arrest the respondent.  They
    were then entitled to search him as an incident to the arrest.  In the course
    of that search they found the cash that was the subject of the possession
    of proceeds of crime charge.</p>

    the police began the initial pursuit of the respondent, he was not detained
    and therefore his s. 9 rights were not engaged.  By the time the officers
    did detain the respondent, they had reasonable grounds to detain within the
    meaning of <i>Mann</i>.  Since the respondent had no reasonable expectation
    of privacy in the knapsack, the police did not violate his s. 8 rights by
    seizing and searching the bag.  The results of that search gave the officers
    grounds to arrest the respondent.  The personal search of the respondent
    was justified as a search incident to arrest.</p>
