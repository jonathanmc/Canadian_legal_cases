style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Following
    a trial by judge and jury, the appellant was convicted of one count of extortion.  He
    appealed that conviction and, acting on his own behalf, raised three grounds
    of appeal.  Like Borins J.A., I would not give effect to any of these three
    grounds of appeal. Justice Borins, however, would allow the appeal in relation
    to a fourth ground raised by the panel. With respect, I disagree that the
    appeal should be allowed on the basis of this fourth ground and would therefore
    dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Some
    brief background is necessary to appreciate the issues in appeal. Several
    years before the alleged extortion took place, the complainant and the appellant
    were jointly charged in a scheme to defraud the government. Initially the
    complainant lied to the police about her involvement. Subsequently, the complainant
    changed her position, cooperated with the police and provided a statement
    under oath to them. The charges against her were withdrawn.  The appellant
    eventually pled guilty to his charges, was convicted and sentenced to a term
    of imprisonment.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    complainant and her husband moved to Y and she obtained new employment.  Some
    time after the appellant was released from prison, he telephoned the complainant
    and advised her that he had written a book about the investigation and that
    he planned on sending her a copy.  Two days later, the book arrived with
    a covering letter containing the appellant’s phone numbers and indicating
    that he planned to begin distribution of the book in the community in one
    week.  The appellant and the complainant met that week at which time the
    appellant told the complainant that people needed to pay for what had been
    done to him and that he was going to start with her.  He told her that, in
    order to stop distribution, she would have to buy all of the ten thousand
    copies of the book that he had printed for $70,000.  He warned her that if
    she did not purchase the “distribution rights”, as he phrased it, he would
    personally ensure that important people in her life received a copy of the
    book and that he would “ruin” her.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    factual context gives rise to the four grounds of appeal.  They are: (1)
    Whether the trial judge erred in his charge to the jury on extortion; (2)
    whether the tapes of the appellant’s telephone conversations with the complainant
    should have been admitted; (3) whether the verdict was unreasonable because
    the appellant did not threaten the complainant; and (4) whether the trial
    judge’s charge failed to adequately review the evidence and, in particular,
    a portion of the complainant’s cross-examination. </p>
  <h4 align=left style='
text-align:left;line-height:normal'>The Jury Charge on Extortion</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    first ground of appeal is that the trial judge erred by failing to instruct
    the jury that “not every distasteful threat will constitute extortion” and
    that
    “the threat must go beyond that which a reasonable person in the circumstances
    of the accused would view as … legitimate”. The alleged omission is derived
    from the instruction to be given when threats are used by the accused to
    collect a legitimate debt: <i>R. v. H.(A.) </i>(2005), 206 C.C.C. (3d) 233
    (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) application for leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused [2005] S.C.C.A. No. 526.  In
    that case, Doherty J.A. held that a
    “threat”, as an element of the offence of extortion, does not need to be
    independently unlawful as long as it was made “without reasonable justification
    or excuse”.  His conclusion followed from the language of the section creating
    the offence of extortion in the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  As
  Doherty J.A. explained in <i>H.(A.)</i>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span>[71] </span>Section
    346(1) is broadly worded to criminalize threats of any kind made in an attempt
    to induce any person to do anything, if those threats are made with the intention
    of obtaining anything. The section is aimed at those who would use coercion
    to overcome the free will of others for the purpose of extracting some gain.
    [Citations omitted.] </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[72] The
    broad prohibition in s. 346(1) is tempered by the availability of the defence
  of ‘reasonable justification or excuse’ …</p>
  <p class=ParaNO align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>In the
    context of addressing the defence of
    “reasonable justification or excuse”, Doherty J.A. made the following comments
    on which the appellant relies:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[84] When an
    accused charged with extortion has used threats in an attempt to collect
    a legitimate debt, the trier of fact must consider all of the circumstances,
    including the nature of the threat and the nature of the demand, to determine
    whether the Crown has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that there was no
    reasonable justification or excuse for the threat. In jury cases, trial judges
    will instruct juries that it is not every distasteful threat used to support
    a legitimate demand for repayment of a debt that will constitute extortion.
    The jury will be told that the threat must go beyond that which a reasonable
    person in the circumstances of the accused would view as a legitimate or
    warranted means of attempting to collect the debt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the case at bar, there is no suggestion that the appellant was attempting
    to collect a legitimate debt and on this basis alone the decision in <i>H.(A.) </i>is
    not directly applicable.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To
    the extent that the instruction from <i>H.(A.)</i> can be read as having
    general application to cases where the demand to which the threat relates
    constitutes legitimate business activity, the charge in this case was nevertheless
    adequate.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    dealing with the nature of the threat, the trial judge told the jury that “to
    be a threat … whatever is communicated must be definite enough that a person
    of ordinary intelligence would understand it as a threat of injury.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant’s demand was that the complainant purchase the distribution rights
    to his book; his threat was that he would disclose the contents of the book
    to important people in the complainant’s life in order to ruin her.  Where
    the “demand” in an extortion case can be viewed neutrally – <i>e.g.</i>,
    a demand to pay a legitimate debt or to purchase a legitimate product – the
    focus shifts to the means deployed by the accused to induce the complainant
    to comply.  As is clear from <i>H.(A.)</i>, the focus is on the “reasonable
    justification or excuse”
    part of the analysis and the inquiry is whether “the threat [goes] beyond
    that which a reasonable person in the circumstances of the accused would
    view as …
    legitimate” in relation to the demand.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although
    the trial judge did not use the precise language suggested by Doherty J.A.
    in <i>H.(A.) </i>when charging the jury, I am satisfied that the jury was
    adequately instructed on the defence of “reasonable justification or excuse”.  The
    trial judge in this case correctly instructed the jury to focus not only
    on the demand made by the appellant but also on how he sought to obtain compliance
    and to measure both against the objective standard of reasonableness.  The
    following passage from the charge is illustrative:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>A reasonable
    justification or excuse is one that the law allows and is reasonable in all
    the circumstances of the case.  The issue is not whether one thing in Mr.
    Royz’s entire course of conduct considered by itself may be justifiable or
    excusable.  In other words, a reasonable justification or excuse relates
    not only to the demand made by Mr. Royz, but also to the making of the threats
    by which Mr. Royz sought to compel compliance with the demand … [T]he Crown
    must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Royz had no such justification
    or excuse.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    jury was correctly instructed to acquit the appellant if the Crown failed
    to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that his threat and demand, viewed together,
    lacked reasonable justification in all the circumstances of the case.  Defence
    counsel, who had earlier cited the decision in <i>H.(A.)</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    in support of his motion for a directed verdict, did not object to the trial
    judge’s charge in this regard. Thus, I would not give effect to this ground
    of appeal </p>
  <h4 align=left style='
text-align:left;line-height:normal'>Admissibility of the Audiotapes</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    second ground of appeal is that the trial judge erred in admitting the audiotape
    evidence.  This ground of appeal also has no merit. At the conclusion of
    the evidence on the <i>voir dire </i>held to determine the admissibility
    of the tapes, counsel for the defence withdrew his objection to their admission
    into evidence.  He conceded, and the trial judge ruled, that the complainant
    had taped the calls of her own volition. The only relevant police conduct
    was a mere suggestion, made when the complainant called the police, that

    third ground of appeal is that the verdict was unreasonable because the appellant
    did not threaten the complainant.  The appellant’s argument is really an
    assertion that there was no evidence on an essential element of the charge

    appellant’s submission that he did not threaten the complainant is based,
    in part, on her evidence in cross-examination.  Counsel’s cross-examination
    of the complainant at trial elicited the admission that in the telephone
    conversations she had with the appellant she had not been threatened, that
    she knew she did not have to accept the appellant’s “offer” to buy the distribution
    rights to his book in the Y area and that, while she was fearful that her
    standing with her family, community and employer would be affected if she
    did not accept the “offer” and agree to a contract, she did not know for
    certain they would be. </p>

    was up to the jury to determine if the complainant’s evidence satisfied the
    legal definition of a “threat” contained in the jury charge.  The complainant’s
    evidence could only bear on the presence or absence of the indicia of the
    legal definition of a “threat”; it could not, in itself, answer the <i>legal
    question </i>of whether the appellant’s conduct satisfied that definition. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    already noted, a “threat” for the purposes of the extortion provision in
    s. 346(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> is very broad in scope and catches “threats
    of <i>any</i> kind made in an attempt to induce <i>any</i> person to do <i>anything</i>” as
    long as it is deployed “with the intention of obtaining <i>anything</i>”:  <i>H.(A.)</i> at
    para. 71. [Emphasis added.]  The legal definition of a threat contemplates “coercion
    employed to overcome the free will of others for the purpose of extracting
    some gain”: <i>H.(A.) </i>at para. 71. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    was ample evidence upon which a properly instructed jury could find that
    a
    “threat” had been made within the meaning of s. 346(1). The appellant told
    the complainant that he would make sure that important people in her life
    found out about the past she wished to keep hidden unless she purchased his
    distribution rights; he told her he would ruin her.  This conduct was coercive
    and clearly falls within the broad definition of a
    “threat” adopted in <i>H.(A.)</i>.  Indeed, Doherty J.A. expressly referred
    to this kind of conduct as a “threat”:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[80] … Some
    threats, while not <i>per se</i> unlawful (e.g., <i>the threat to disclose
    some despicable act from one's distant past</i>), will have a much more coercive
    effect than a threat to do something which is in and of itself unlawful (<i>e.g.</i>,
    a threat to trespass on property). [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=ParaNO align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>The appellant’s

    trial judge in this case did not undertake an extensive review of the evidence.  Instead,
    in the context of reviewing the positions of the Crown and the defence, he
    described some of the evidence in support of their respective positions.  For
    ease of reference, I provide the passages from the jury charge where the
    evidence is addressed:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In terms of
    the evidence that you have heard and the exhibits that have been filed, I
    do not intend to repeat all of it to you now, this has been a short trial
    and it should be relatively fresh in your minds, the theory of the Crown’s
    case is that Mr. R. communicated with [the complainant] with a view of obtaining
    up to seventy thousand dollars from her.  The Crown maintains that even though
    [the complainant] may have had a choice of accepting to distribute Mr. R.’s
    book, that such choice was coerced from her through a threat of distribution
    within the Y area.  The inference is that she could avoid that by entering
    into an agreement with Mr. R. to purchase distribution rights for that area.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[The complainant]
    testified she was fearful that the contents of the book … would come to the
    attention of her step-daughter, her step-daughter’s friends, her neighbours
    and most of all her employer.  She feared for her livelihood, that her ability
    to provide for herself and others would be put in jeopardy.  In support of
    the Crown’s theory [counsel] points out that, the note filed as Exhibit Number
    Two, referred to a one week deadline to read after which time the book would
    be distributed in Y.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Counsel for
    Mr. R. argues there was no extortion, that Mr. R. is a writer and that he
    sought to sell his book, giving [the complainant] the opportunity to acquire
    distribution rights within the Y area.  In support of that contention reference
    is made to Mr. R.’s profession as a writer, publisher.  That he was prepared
    to give [the complainant] more time, as well as reduce the original asking
    price.  Ultimately, that he wanted a contract between the two of them and
    that she should see a lawyer in that regard.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Now that is
    a very brief summary of the Crown and defence positions.  What is important
    is that your decision must of course be based on the totality of the evidence
    that you have heard and seen, including the exhibits that have been filed.  And
    when coming to your individual conclusion as to the guilt or innocence of
    the accused you should make use of your good common sense and every day experience,
    and in line with that it is open to you to make reasonable inferences based
    on the evidence that you have heard, or indeed on the lack of evidence on
    any particular point.</p>

    Borins is of the opinion that the trial judge erred in not reviewing the
    evidence of the complainant where, in cross-examination, she stated on several
    occasions that the appellant never threatened her during her telephone conversations
    with him or in his written letter to her and also agreed that she did not
    know for certain that her employment and reputation would be affected if
    she did not comply with the appellant’s demand.  In his opinion this evidence
    was central to the appellant’s defence and, he states at para. 63 of his
    reasons, “[it] represented a serious ground for exculpating the accused” or
    at the very least for raising a reasonable doubt.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>With
    respect, I disagree. When the extract from the complainant’s cross-examination
    is viewed in the context of the legal definition of a threat and of the complainant’s
    evidence as a whole it cannot constitute the foundation for the appellant’s
    defence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    are two reasons for my conclusion.  First, the legal definition of a threat
    was never put to the complainant in cross-examination and any reasonable
    doubt held by the jury in this regard needed to relate to this legal definition
    As I attempted to underscore earlier in these reasons, the legal definition
    of a “threat”&nbsp;is broad and includes any conduct employed to induce any
    person to do anything or to overcome that person’s will with the intention
    of obtaining anything: <i>H.(A.)</i> at para. 71.  Further, the jury had
    to apply the definition of a threat, as legally defined for them by the trial
    judge in his charge, to the evidence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    in order for a threat to exist the complainant did not have to know for certain
    that she would be harmed by the appellant’s disclosure of her past; exposure
    to potential serious harm is sufficient.  In <i>R. v. McLure </i>(1957),
    118 C.C.C. 192 (Man. C.A.), cited with approval in <i>R. v. H.(A), </i>at
    para. 80, the accused told the complainant he would sell a story to the newspaper
    providing details of the complainant’s recent conviction on a charge of disorderly
    conduct unless the complainant paid him $200.  Justice Doherty commented
    on this case in the following terms: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
class=Doubleindent-quoteChar>Publication of the details surrounding the conviction
      had the potential to seriously harm the victim’s standing in the community
      and his employment.  Applying the appellant’s analysis, the offence of
      extortion would not be made out because the accused was legally entitled
      to sell the story to the newspaper and a demand for payment in lieu of
      publication is not <i>per se</i> unlawful.  However, the threat and the
      demand taken together constitute powerful intimidation calculated to overcome
      the free choice of even the strongest person</span>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Bearing
    in mind the existing jurisprudence, the complainant’s admissions in cross-examination
    that the appellant had not threatened her and that she did not know for certain
    that harm would befall her if she did not comply with his demand, had limited
    evidentiary value and could not constitute the foundation for a defence.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      charging a jury, a trial judge has a discretion to determine how far he
      or she should go in reviewing the evidence, keeping in mind factors such
      as the nature of the evidence, the number and complexity of the issues
      raised, the conduct of the trial and of counsel, including their closing
      addresses, and his or her assessment of the particular jury: <i>Daley</i>, <i>supra</i> at

line-height:normal'><span>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Three
    other considerations support my conclusion that the trial judge was not obliged
    to review the evidence pertaining to the complainant’s cross-examination
    in charging the jury. They are the length of the trial, the nature of the
    evidence, and the lack of any objection by defence counsel to the charge.  </p>

    trial judge’s decision to omit a substantial review of the evidence was made
    in the context of a very short and simple trial.  The evidence in this case
    took less than a day and a half to complete (including the <i>voir dire</i>)
    and would have been fresh in the minds of the jurors. There were only three
    witnesses –
    the complainant, her mother and the investigating officer.  The appellant
    did not testify.  </p>

      case at bar was not of the, “He said, She said,” variety.  The issues were
      focused on the legal interpretation to be accorded to the complainant’s
      evidence.  In this regard, two entirely consistent points emerged from
      her evidence.  One, emphasized by Borins J.A. in the passages cited by
      him, is that the complainant agreed that the appellant never verbalized
      the specific harmful consequences to her that would follow from his disclosure
      of the book to important people in her life. In that sense, she agreed
      he never threatened her. The other is that in her examination-in-chief
      the complainant testified that the appellant promised to ruin her.  In
      cross
    –examination she did not resile from this position as the following exchange
    indicates: </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Q.  And so … there

      expressly reviewed the positions of the Crown and the defence – the jury

    this note from Mr. Royz: “You have one week to read the book, until Sept.
    20, after Sept. 20 I will begin a distribution.”  Although she “skimmed” the
    book, Ms. X did not read it.  She telephoned Mr. Royz on Friday, September

    the meeting, Mr. Royz told Ms. X that she had
    “ruined” him.  He said her testimony was untrue, that people had to pay for
    what had been done to him, and he was going to start with her.  He told her
    that he would sell her the 10,000 published copies of the book for $7 each,
    in return for which she would receive the exclusive rights to distribute
    it in Y.  He wanted it to be a business arrangement that would be “above
    board and legal”, and he wanted lawyers to be involved.  Mr. Royz said that
    if she did not agree, he would distribute the book to her step-daughters’ friends
    and teacher, her neighbours and her workplace.  He said: “I will make your
    name mud in Y.”  Ms. X told him that she did not have $70,000.  When she
    suggested that she pay $300 each month, Mr. Royz said that it wasn’t enough,
    and asked for at least $1,000 each month.  Because she wanted to buy time,
    Ms. X asked if she could give him a decision the next day, to which he agreed.</p>

    that if her employer read the book it might adversely affect her employment.  She
    said that her employer “might have quite a different opinion of [her] and
    could cause [her] some harm”.  She speculated that she could be fired.  In
    short, she did not want the book to be distributed “so that people she worked

    contained no demand or threat – it merely stated his intention to distribute
    it.  She phoned Mr. Royz because she wanted to avoid the book’s distribution
    to her employer.  However, she admitted that she was speculating about her
    employer’s reaction should he see the book.  Therefore, she wanted to meet

    didn’t accept the offer,
    “I am a writer, I will try to sell my book, that’s all”.  She agreed with

    Royz did not testify.  After his counsel unsuccessfully moved for a directed
    verdict, the trial judge delivered his instructions to the jury.  The instructions
    were brief, covering only twenty-one pages of the transcript.  After providing
    the usual introductory instructions, he dealt with reasonable doubt.  He
    then spent seven pages explaining the four elements of the offence of extortion.  In
    two brief paragraphs the trial judge reviewed the positions of the Crown
    and the defence, during which he very briefly touched on some of the evidence
    that was ostensibly in support of these positions.  Then he gave his concluding
    instructions.  Just before he outlined the positions of the parties, the
    trial judge said: “I do not intend to repeat all of [the evidence] to you
    now, this has been a short trial and it should be relatively fresh in your
    minds.”  The trial judge, therefore, did not provide the jury with a thorough
    review of the evidence supporting the case for the Crown or the case for
    the defence.</p>

    I mentioned at the outset of my reasons, Mr. Royz relied on three grounds
    of appeal: (1) that he did not threaten Ms. X, as she stated in her cross-examination;
    (2) the trial judge’s failure to instruct the jury in accordance with <i>R.
    v. Alexander</i>; and (3) the admissibility of tape recordings of telephone
    conversations between himself and Ms. X.  As a self-represented appellant,
    no doubt Mr. Royz did not know that because this was a jury trial this court
    could not give effect to his first ground of appeal unless he established
    that the verdict was unreasonable.  In my view, this argument would not have
    succeeded.  However, Ms. X’s evidence that she was not threatened by Mr.
    Royz is relevant to the consideration of what I believe is the real defect
    in the trial judge’s instructions – his failure to adequately review the
    evidence in support of the case for the defence and for the Crown.  Because
    this was an inmate appeal where the appellant represented himself, in my
    view it is appropriate to consider this issue although not raised by the
    appellant.  In my view, in the circumstance of this case, the court has an
    obligation to consider any reasonable ground of appeal available by the appellant,
    although not raised by him.  I will deal with this ground before I consider
    the appellant’s remaining grounds of appeal.</p>

    three cases are <i>Azoulay v. The Queen</i> (1952), 104 C.C.C. 97 (S.C.C.); <i>Kelsey
    v. The Queen </i>(1953), 105 C.C.C. 97 (S.C.C.); and <i>Lizotte v. The Queen</i> (1953),
    106 C.C.C. 1 (S.C.C.).  Two subsequent cases <i>Colpitts v. The Queen</i> [1966]
    1 C.C.C. 146 (S.C.C.) and <i>R. v. Jacquard</i> (1997), 113 C.C.C. (3d) 1
    (S.C.C.) reiterated this proposition.  It has also been reiterated in three
    recent decisions of this court: <i>R. v. MacKinnon</i> (1999), 132 C.C.C.
    (3d) 545 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>

    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ); and <i>R. v. Mahalingen</i> (2006), 208 C.C.C. (3d) 515 (Ont.

    an off-quoted passage from <i>Azoulay</i>, at pp. 98-99 Taschereau J. stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The rule which
    has been laid down, and consistently followed is that in a jury trial the
    presiding Judge must, except in rare cases where it would be needless to
    do so, review the substantial parts of the evidence, and give the jury the
    theory of the defence, so that they may appreciate the value and effect of
    that evidence, and how the law is to be applied to the facts as they find
    them: <i>Spencer v. Alaska Packers Ass’n</i>, (1904), 35 S.C.R. 362.  As
    Kellock J.A. ( as then was) said in <i>R. v. Stephen</i>, [1944], 3 D.L.R.
    656 at p. 655, O.R. 339 at p. 352, 81 Can. C.C. 283 at 293: “It is not sufficient
    that the whole evidence be left to the jury <i>in bulk for valuation</i>.”  The
    pivotal questions upon which the defence stands must be clearly presented
    to the jury’s mind. [Emphasis in the original.]</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>…No doubt, it
    is not imperative that the Judge describe in detail each and every one of
    the circumstances that surrounded a crime, but still it is necessary that
    he place before the jury all that is revealed by the witnesses, either for
    the Crown or for the defence, <i>which could be a serious ground for exculpating
    the accused</i>: <i>Azoulay v. The Queen</i>, 104

line-height:normal'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
    on the authorities to which I have referred, it is the duty of the trial
    judge in instructing the jury to explain the position of the defence, and
    to review the evidence essential in arriving at a just conclusion in respect
    to the defence.  This is particularly important in this case where in cross-examination
    Ms. X repeated many times that she had not been threatened by the appellant.  This
    evidence was central to Mr. Royz’s defence and represented a serious ground
    for exculpating the accused.  At the very least, a properly instructed jury
    should have been told that this evidence was sufficient to create a reasonable
    doubt.  I would add that in rare cases, where the facts and the issues are
    simple and the trial has been brief, and where it would be needless to do
    so, failure to comply with this duty may not result in a reversible error: <i>R.
    v. Dwyer</i> (1997), 35 C.C.C. (2d) 400 (Ont. C.A.).  This is not one of
    those rare cases.  I acknowledge, as well, that trial judges must be given
    considerable latitude in fashioning a jury charge that is appropriate to
    the circumstances of the case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
    the issue of the inadequacy of the trial judge’s instructions was raised
    by the court subsequent to the hearing of the appeal, counsel for the Crown
    and Mr. Royz were asked to provide submissions on this issue.  The Crown
    submitted that given the brief trial of one and a half days, the simple nature
    of the case, as well as the trial judge’s fair summary of the defence position
    and his brief reference to the evidence, as in <i>Dwyer</i>, it was not necessary
    for him to summarize the evidence in any greater detail than he did.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not agree.  As I have indicated, this is not one of those rare cases in
    which it was needless for the trial judge to review the evidence in support
    of the defence.  While it was likely that in his closing submissions to the
    jury, counsel for Mr. Royz raised this issue, counsel’s submissions are not
    a substitute for what a trial judge is required to do.  The trial judge plays
    a special role in a jury trial and his words usually carry more weight with
    the jury than those of counsel.  As stated by Taschereau J. in <i>Lizotte</i>,
    it is necessary for the trial judge to place before the jury all the evidence “which
    could be a serious ground for exculpating the accused”.  Clearly, Ms. X’s
    testimony given in cross-examination was capable of exculpating Mr. Royz.  She
    did not perceive anything that was said to her by Mr. Royz to be a threat
    to distribute the book – which is the threat alleged in the indictment.</p>

    for the second ground of appeal, the appellant submitted that in instructing
    the jury about the elements of extortion the trial judge failed to comply
    with the view of Doherty J.A. para. 84 of <i>R. v. Alexander</i>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[84] When an
    accused charged with extortion has used threats in an attempt to collect
    a legitimate debt, the trier of fact must consider all of the circumstance,
    including the nature of the threat and the nature of the demand, to determine
    whether the Crown has proved beyond a reasonable doubt that there was no
    reasonable justification or excuse for the threat.  <i>In jury cases, trial
    judges will instruct juries that it is not every distasteful threat used
    to support a legitimate demand for repayment of a debt that will constitute
    extortion.  The jury will be told that the threat must go beyond that which
    a reasonable person in the circumstances of the accused would view as a legitimate
    or warranted means of attempting to collect the debt</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I understand his position, the appellant submits that in instructing the
    jury on the Crown’s obligation to prove that there was not reasonable justification
    or excuse for an alleged threat, the trial judge was required to tell the
    jury that not every distasteful threat will constitute extortion and that
    the threat must go beyond that which a reasonable person would view as legitimate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the appellant has placed too broad an interpretation on Doherty
    J.A.’s comments.  The issue in <i>Alexander</i> evolved from the defendant’s
    threat to send a letter to the complainant’s employer concerning her character
    in an attempt to collect an outstanding debt owed by the complainant to the
    wife of the defendant.  The issue was whether a “legally permissible threat” to
    collect a
    “legitimately owed debt” could constitute extortion.  Doherty J.A. considered
    the issue in the context of whether this might present a reasonable justification
    or excuse, the focus being the means used to collect a legitimate debt.  He
    said that there are such situations where the means used to collect such
    a debt goes beyond what could reasonably be regarded as warranted or legitimate.  Thus,
    Doherty J.A.’s comments in para. 84 are limited to the use of threats in
    an attempt to collect a legitimate debt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would add one further thought.  Extortion is a complex offence consisting
    of four elements.  Using a standard form jury instruction, the trial judge
    gave a seven page explanation of each of the elements.  In my view, it would
    have been helpful for the jury had he reviewed the evidence in relation to
    each of the elements after he explained each element.  Because of what I
    would characterize as the significant nature of the evidence in this case,
    particularly Ms. X’s cross-examination, reviewing the evidence in this way
    would have helped the jury focus on whether what occurred constituted extortion.  </p>
