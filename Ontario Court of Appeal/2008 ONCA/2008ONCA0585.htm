    appellant, Ewaryst Prokofiew, was convicted of conspiracy to defraud the
    Government of Canada and six counts of fraud over $5,000 relating to six
    companies.  He was sentenced to four years and ordered to pay restitution
    of $500,000.  The appellant, Gregory Postnikoff, was convicted of the same
    conspiracy, and of four counts of fraud over $5,000 relating to four companies.  He
    was sentenced to a conditional sentence of two years less a day and ordered
    to pay restitution in the amount of $155,000.  Each appellant appeals both
    conviction and sentence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    between them the appellants relied on several grounds of appeal, in my view
    I need deal only with one ground – that the trial judge gave insufficient
    reasons for convicting the appellant.  For the reasons that follow, I would
    give effect to this ground and allow each appeal.</p>
  <h4 align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>II</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the purpose of these reasons, it is unnecessary to review the facts in any
    detail.  Indeed, as there must be a new trial, it is preferable not to do
    so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants, together with a number of other individuals, were alleged to
    have executed a fraudulent scheme, the purpose of which was to collect and
    not remit G.S.T. and to fraudulently obtain refunds of Goods and Services
    Tax (“G.S.T.”), known as Input Tax Credits.  The scheme involved the purported
    sales of automobiles.  While the automobiles often existed, they were not
    the subject matter of the sales.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    scheme involved three categories of business entities: (1) paper companies;
    (2) legitimate automobile dealers; and (3) aboriginal registered companies.  First,
    the paper companies were created and operated under the direction of one
    of more of the named defendants.  These paper companies were registered to
    nominees, who were recruited to facilitate the fraudulent transactions and
    to ensure that the names of the defendants did not appear on government documents
    in relation to these companies.  Second, there were legitimate automobile
    dealers (middle companies), involved in the sale of automobiles.  The scheme
    involved a sham sale of an automobile by one of the first group of entities
    (the paper companies) to a company falling within the second group (the legitimate
    automobile dealers).  The vendor paper companies would collect and not remit
    the G.S.T. from the transaction.  The purchaser (legitimate automobile dealers)
    would pay G.S.T. to the paper companies.  The legitimate automobile dealers
    would then claim a G.S.T. refund from the federal government (an Input Tax
    Credit) upon a sham resale of the non-existent automobile to an entity in
    the third category, companies registered in the name of tax exempt aboriginal
    individuals.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  The scheme depended on the G.S.T. exempt status
    of the entities in the third category for its “apparent”
    legitimacy.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, the Crown argued that the evidence established beyond a reasonable
    doubt that the defendants conspired to fabricate documentation respecting
    delivery of vehicles to a reserve or that they recruited carrier companies
    or individuals to physically drive vehicles to a reserve, take a photo of
    the vehicle and then return the vehicle to the original dealership or rental
    agency.  The photographed vehicles were never left on the reserve.  None
    of the photographs contained identifying information such as the VIN, licence
    plate number or odometer reading.  The trial judge found that it was clear
    beyond a reasonable doubt that both appellants and an additional named defendant,
    Joseph Rothe, were members of the conspiracy and were guilty of the various
    counts of fraud.  She found that the quantum of loss to the federal government
    in both G.S.T. collected and not remitted and fraudulent funds paid was in
    excess of $11 million.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    respect of the appellant, Prokofiew, the trial judge found that he was not
    only a member of the conspiracy, but also that he played a significant role
    in the scheme to defraud the Canadian government.  She determined that this
    appellant first became involved in the scheme while a general manager of
    Oakville Motors Inc. between 1993 and 1997.  After he resigned from Oakville
    Motors, he continued working in the wholesale car industry by brokering wholesale
    car deals for which he was paid a consulting or brokerage fee.  This appellant
    was found to have brokered transactions for a number of companies that were
    involved in all three phases of the scheme.  Prokofiew did not testify.  In
    this appeal, he accepts the correctness of the trial judge’s findings with
    respect to the existence of the conspiracy, but takes issue with the finding
    that he participated in it.  He further submits that the trial judge gave
    insufficient reasons for her verdict.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant, Postnikoff, also takes no issue with the trial judge’s finding
    of the existence of the fraudulent scheme and limits his complaints on appeal
    to the finding of his participation in it and the failure of the trial judge
    to provide sufficient reasons for her verdict.  The trial judge expressly
    rejected Postnikoff’s submission that he was “merely a nominee”.  This appellant
    was the registered owner of a company called Adnil Holdings.  This company
    was part of the fraudulent scheme involved in the purported sale of vehicles.
    Funds in excess of $50 million flowed through Adnil Holdings’ bank account
    between 1995 and 1997.  Prokofiew brokered deals for Adnil Holdings and the
    evidence indicated that Postnikoff knew and worked with Prokofiew.  The trial
    judge determined that Postnikoff was a member of the conspiracy whose role
    was the implementation of fraudulent transactions, particularly on the east
    coast of
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  In reaching this determination, she accepted the evidence of Dennis Leggett,
    an individual recruited by Postnikoff and other conspirators for the purpose
    of establishing companies in the wholesale car business.  Leggett testified
    that the appellant recruited him and manipulated him into setting up the
    company, Coast to Coast Auto, as a “nominee owner”.  Postnikoff then excluded
    Leggett from the operation of the company except as required with respect
    to the financial administration.  The trial judge relied heavily on the testimony
    of Leggett in support of her conclusion that Postnikoff was a member of the
    conspiracy and involved in setting up fraudulent transactions.  This appellant
    did not testify.  </p>
  <h4 align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>III</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    was a very long trial.  It took place intermittently over a period of seven
    months.  The trial judge’s reasons for conviction consist of 742 paragraphs.  An
    additional 122 paragraphs comprise her reasons for sentence.  Because the
    trial judge left for the sentencing phase of the trial certain critical findings
    of fact, it is fair to say that her reasons for judgment comprised 864 paragraphs.  Although
    it may appear counter-intuitive for the appellants to argue that the lengthy
    reasons for judgment are fatally flawed because they contain insufficient
    reasons explaining the convictions, as I will explain, the appellants are
    correct.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge structured her reasons for judgment in this way.  First, she
    reviewed the elements of the offences of conspiracy and fraud.  She then
    provided an overview of the allegations against the nine defendants who were
    being tried by her.  Following this overview, the trial judge described the
    creation of the G.S.T. by a number of sections of the <i>Excise Tax Act</i>,
    R.S.C. 1985, c. E-15 and also by s. 87 of the <i>Indian Act</i> that provides
    that the personal property of an Indian situated on a reserve is exempt from
    taxation.  Then she spent considerable time discussing the wholesale car
    business, which is at the heart of the alleged conspiracy and fraudulent
    transactions.  Next the trial judge summarized what she described as “the
    indicia in the evidence relied upon by the Crown to prove the existence of
    a conspiracy to defraud the federal government and fraudulent activity”.  She
    then devoted 24 paragraphs to a review of the evidence of Leslie Winters.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge then moved to a consideration of the issues.  First she considered
    whether there was a conspiracy.  To do so, she reviewed the evidence of many
    witnesses under the following headings:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>(a) the relationship of the defendants, one to another;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>(b) the creation of “paper companies”;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>(c) payment to the holders of “paper companies”;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>(d) execution of blank cheques;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>(e) forged, unauthorized or unknown signatures;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>(f) false documents;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>(g) the same vehicle purchased or sold more than once by the same party
    or parties; and</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>(h) the “Zolis” analysis and the “Lomer” chart.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>This review of the evidence
    occupied 128 paragraphs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Next,
    the trial judge considered the position of the defence.  First, she dealt
    with whether the Crown had proved beyond a reasonable doubt in respect to
    the transactions that formed the basis of the indictment, whether they concerned
    vehicles that did not exist, described as “phantom vehicles”.  She appears
    to have resolved this issue in favour of the Crown.  Second, the trial judge
    considered, and rejected, the defence submission that the conspiracy charges
    should be dismissed because the Crown had relied on multiple conspiracies
    rather than the conspiracy as charged.  There is no appeal from this finding.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    preliminary aspect of the trial judge’s reasons required 296 paragraphs.  At
    paragraph 297 she stated her conclusion that the Crown had proved the existence
    of the conspiracy as charged:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Notwithstanding the submissions of defence counsel,
    I had the opportunity to observe all of the witnesses, review their testimony
    and the exhibits at trial and I find on all of the admissible evidence I
    am entitled to consider that the first essential element of the count of
    conspiracy has been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge then moved to a consideration of whether the Crown had proved
    whether any of the defendants were members of the conspiracy.  First, she
    considered the evidence relating to Mr. Prokofiew.  Before doing so, she
    stated at paragraphs 302 and 303:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Mr. Prokofiew stands charged with not only the
    count of conspiracy but also a number of counts involving fraud and the companies
    known as Fulton Auto, Trent International Export Inc., Ry Se Services, Coast
    to Coast Auto Truck and Leasing, Adnil Holdings and Erinwood Ford Sales.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>On the evidence before me, I find that I am satisfied
    beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Prokofiew was not only a member of the
    conspiracy but along with Mr. Rothe, he played a significant role in the
    formulation and implementation of the agreement to defraud the Government
    of Canada and did defraud the Government of Canada.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>In the following 57 paragraphs,
    the trial judge reviewed small portions of the testimony of Mr. Nettagog,
    Mr. Tulloch, Mr. Ponte, Mr. Proszak, Mr. Winters, Ms. Girouard and Ms. O’Meara.  She
    concluded at paragraphs 361 to 364:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There is no evidence that Mr. Prokofiew was involved
    in all of the transactions before the Court.  In other words, there is no
    evidence that Mr. Prokofiew was involved in every aspect of the implementation
    of the conspiracy or was even aware of the extent of the implementation of
    the conspiracy.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I am entirely satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt,
    however, that Mr. Prokofiew was a member of the conspiracy to defraud the
    Government of Canada as alleged.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I am also satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt for
    the foregoing reasons that Mr. Prokofiew is guilty of the remaining outstanding
    offences of fraud involving the companies as set out in the Indictment.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>For all of these reasons, I find Mr. Prokofiew
    guilty as charged.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    next part of the trial judge’s reasons relate to the evidence against Mr.
    Postnikoff.  As she did in respect to Mr. Prokofiew, she reviewed some of
    the testimony of the following witnesses – Mr. Ponte, Mr. Tulloch, Mr. Weeks,
    Mr. Marling-Howse and Mr. Legget.  This required 40 paragraphs, followed
    by the trial judge’s conclusion at paragraph 405:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Mr. Postnikoff is guilty as charged.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge then considered the evidence in respect to the remaining five
    defendants.  (Two of the original nine defendants had pleaded guilty).  This
    exercise required 318 paragraphs.  After some general comments, the trial
    judge concluded her reasons for conviction by stating the following at paragraphs
    740 to 742:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Finally, although I am entirely satisfied beyond
    a reasonable doubt that a conspiracy as alleged in the Indictment existed
    and that Mr. Prokofiew, Mr. Rothe and Mr. Postnikoff were members of that
    conspiracy and are also guilty of the charges of fraud as alleged by the
    Crown, I am not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the extent of the
    fraud amounted to 25 million dollars.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>As I have indicated in my Judgment, the fact of
    and coexistence of legitimate transactions does not undermine the fraudulent
    nature of other transactions.  The fact and coexistence of legitimate transactions
    in this case, however, does undermine the allegation that the Government
    of Canada was wrongly deprived to the extent of $25 million.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I make these comments with respect to the quantum
    only to alert the parties with respect to submissions on sentencing should
    counsel deem it relevant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>The Crown’s position was
    that the defendants had defrauded the government of
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    of $25 million.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the trial judge had not made a finding of fact in her reasons for conviction
    of the actual amount by which the defendants had defrauded the government
    of
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    , she turned to this issue in her reasons for sentence.  At the sentencing
    hearing, the Crown called the lead investigator who testified that all of
    the G.S.T. money that was collected but not remitted to the government was
    about $24 million.  The trial judge rejected the investigator’s evidence.  At
    paragraph 65, she found that “the accumulated potential and actual loss to
    the Federal Government as a result of this conspiracy and fraud executed
    in the
    <st1:place w:st="on">

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants’ position is that the trial judge provided insufficient reasons
    for convicting them of conspiracy, and no reasons for convicting them of
    the individual counts of fraud over $5,000.  Although Mr. Prokofiew took
    no issue with the correctness of the trial judge’s finding that the Crown
    had proved the existence of a conspiracy, he took issue with the trial judge’s
    findings as to the mechanics of the conspiracy, that he was a member of it
    and that he had committed the substantive fraud charges.  His simple point
    is that because the trial judge made so few findings of fact in respect to
    his convictions it is impossible to trace the path she followed in convicting
    him.  In other words, her finding of guilt is merely conclusory.  While it
    can be said that the evidence she reviewed before finding him guilty of all
    charges, in a general sense, related to the conspiracy count, she did not
    relate that evidence to the seven substantive counts of fraud relating to
    seven different companies.  Counsel for Mr. Prokofiew concluded by stating
    that the deficiencies in the trial judge’s reasoning means that this court
    cannot follow the analytical path she took in convicting him, and, thus,
    properly assess the correctness of the verdicts.  Counsel for Mr. Postnikoff
    adopted this argument.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
    of my view of Mr. Prokofiew’s principle argument, it is not necessary to
    deal with his alternative submission that the trial judge misapprehended
    and misunderstood the substance of the evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    respect to the appellants’ position that the trial judge gave insufficient
    reasons for convicting them on the conspiracy count, the respondent’s reply
    was that the trial judge noted that she had considered all of the evidence
    that enured to the benefit of the appellant.  Counsel for the respondent
    argued that she had referred to ample evidence under a variety of categories
    to support her findings of guilt.  I took these submissions as an invitation
    for the court to engage in its own review of the record which, on analysis,
    counsel for the respondent submitted we would find supported the appellants’ convictions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent acknowledged that the trial judge did not specifically break down
    her findings in respect of liability on the conspiracy count and the substantive
    fraud counts.  This, the respondent argued, did not have the effect of undermining
    the conspiracy convictions.  Counsel for the respondent submitted that the
    evidence of the conspiracy was in substance the same evidence as that of
    the substantive offences.  Therefore, it would be unreasonable to expect
    the trial judge to have separated her analysis of guilt on the conspiracy
    count from her analysis on the substantive fraud counts.  However, the trial
    judge made no finding that a joint enterprise existed, which would have enabled
    the same evidence to apply to both the conspiracy and the substantive counts.</p>

    agree with counsel for the appellants that the trial judge failed to provide
    sufficient reasons to allow for meaningful appellate review.  In my view,
    counsel for the Crown did not provide an effective answer to the appellants’ position.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge made a number of findings of fact with respect to the involvement
    of Mr. Prokofiew and Mr. Postnikoff in the conspiracy with which they were
    charged.  In regard to Mr. Prokofiew, her principle findings were (1) that
    he was involved with the other defendants in the wholesale car business and
    (2) that he had control over some companies that were found to have been
    involved in the illicit scheme.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, these findings could not support a conviction for conspiracy.  The
    problem with the first finding on its own is that the trial judge failed
    to take this finding to the next step and explicitly find that Mr. Prokofiew
    was involved in the illegitimate transactions engaged in by some of the other
    defendants.  There is a similar problem with the second finding.  It would
    appear that the trial judge implicitly concluded that Mr. Prokofiew’s control
    over the transactions of certain companies found to be involved in the scheme
    established his involvement in the conspiracy.  Again, the difficulty with
    these findings is that the trial judge failed to distinguish between the
    legitimate and illegitimate transactions of these companies and specifically
    identify what evidence established Mr. Prokofiew’s involvement in the illegitimate
    transactions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    respect to Mr. Postnikoff, the trial judge’s principle finding was that he
    knew people who were involved in the conspiracy.  She also found that he
    owned a company, and
    “was involved” with another company, that were engaged in illegitimate transactions.  She
    seems to have inferred from these findings that he was aware of and participated
    in the illegitimate transactions of these companies.  However, as with Mr.
    Prokofiew, the reasons supporting this inference are insufficient on which
    to found a conviction as they fail to identify evidence establishing Mr.
    Postnikoff’s participation in the illegitimate transactions, apart from simply
    his control over these companies.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the position of counsel for the appellants that the trial judge
    failed to provide sufficient reasons to allow for meaningful appellate review.  In
    reaching my conclusion, I have found helpful the recent decisions of the
    Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. Dinardo</i>, (2008), 231 C.C.C. (3d)
    177 (Sup.
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ct. Can.), and <i>R. v.

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ct. Can.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Dinardo</i>,
    Charron J. reviewed the jurisprudence that requires a trial judge to provide
    meaningful reasons for conviction or acquittal, with particular emphasis
    on the leading decision in <i>R. v. Sheppard</i>, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 869.  In
    the course of this review, Charron J. emphasizes that an appeal court reviewing
    the sufficiency of reasons should adopt a “functional approach”, examining
    the evidence as a whole and the submissions of counsel in the assessment
    of whether the reasons respond to the case’s live issues.  She emphasizes
    that it is only where “the trial judge’s reasons are so deficient that they
    foreclose meaningful appellate review”, that the appeal based on insufficient
    reasons will be allowed: <i>Dinardo </i>at para. 25. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    paras. 30 &amp; 32, in comments relevant to this appeal, Charron J. concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]here is no general requirement that reasons
    be so detailed that they allow an appeal court to retry the entire case on
    appeal.  There is no need to prove that the trial judge was alive to and
    considered all of the evidence, or answer each and every argument of counsel
    (<i>Braich</i>, at para. 38).  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This Court emphasized in <i>Sheppard</i> that no
    error will be found where the basis for the trial judge’s conclusion is “apparent
    from the record, even without being articulated” (para. 55).  If the trial
    judge’s reasons are deficient, the reviewing court must examine the evidence
    and determine whether the reasons for conviction are, in fact, patent on
    the record.  <i>This exercise is not an invitation to appellate courts to
    engage in a reassessment of aspects of the case not resolved by the trial
    judge.  Where the trial judge’s reasoning is not apparent from the reasons
    or the record…the appeal court ought not to substitute its own analysis for
    that of the trial judge (Sheppard</i>, at paras. 52 and 55).  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    principles espoused in <i>Dinardo </i>are recognized as well by Binnie J.
    in <i>R. v. Walker</i> at para. 20, who also refers to <i>Sheppard</i> and
    the principle that “[t]he appellate court is not given the power to intervene
    simply because it thinks the trial court did a poor job of expressing itself”.  Binnie
    J. also refers to <i>Sheppard’s </i>recognition of a number of broad policy
    reasons that underscore the importance of the duty to give adequate reasons
    at para. 19:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>At the trial level, the reasons justify and explain
    the result.  “Reasons for judgment are the primary mechanism by which judges
    account to the parties and to the public for the decisions they render” (para.
    15).  The losing party is entitled to know why he or she has lost.  Informed
    consideration can be given to grounds for appeal.  “Interested members of
    the public can satisfy themselves that justice has been done, or not, as
    the case may be” (para. 24).  “Trial courts, where the essential findings
    of facts and drawing of inferences are done, can only be held properly to
    account if the reasons for their adjudication are transparent and accessible
    to the public and to the appellate courts” (para. 15). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    appears that the entire focus of the trial judge’s reasons in this case was
    whether the Crown had proved that the appellants were guilty of conspiracy.  She
    understood the issues, which were whether the Crown had proved a conspiracy
    and whether the appellants were members of it.  My main problem with the
    trial judge’s reasons is that she made so few findings of fact on her way
    to the conclusory finding that each appellant was guilty as charged
    – meaning guilty of conspiracy and the individual counts of fraud over $5,000
    with which each appellant was charged.  Consequently, the facts on which
    she based the convictions are lacking.  Because reasons for conviction were
    not patent on the record, I am unable to determine the analytical path she
    followed in convicting the appellants.  Consequently, the trial judge failed
    to provide sufficient reasons to allow for meaningful appellate review.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    for the individual counts of fraud, the trial judge failed to consider them
    at all.  Because of the wording of the charges, it was important for her
    to find the facts on which she based her convictions.  For example, a typical
    fraud charge reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>THAT Ewaryst Romuald PROKOFIEW and Peter Steven
    SOLTY between the 1<sup>st</sup> day of May in 1997 and the 31<sup>st</sup> day
    of July in the year 1997, both dates inclusive, at the Town of Oakville in
    the said Region and elsewhere in the Province of Ontario did by deceit, falsehood
    or other fraudulent means defraud the Government of Canada of monies of a
    value exceeding five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) in relation to Erinwood
    Ford contrary to Section 380(1)(a) of the <i>Criminal Code of Canada</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Each of the other fraud
    charges referred to a different company.  The trial judge was required to
    separately consider the evidence relative to each count of fraud, as well
    as the evidence relevant to the conspiracy counts.  In respect to the above
    count, for example, she was required to find what the accused did that constituted
    the defrauding of Erinwood Ford, and that the amount of the fraud exceeded
    $5,000.  Nowhere in her reasons did she embark on this exercise in respect
    to any of the fraud counts.  Clearly, the trial judge’s lack of reasons do
    not allow for meaningful appellate review of the fraud convictions.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Obviously
    the trial judge spent a lot of time and effort in drafting her reasons for
    judgment.  It took her about a year to release her reasons.  Regrettably,
    despite this, for the reasons that I have explained, there must be a new
    trial as there is evidence on which a conviction could be found on all the
    charges.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    all of the foregoing reasons, I would allow the appeals, set aside the appellants’ convictions
    and order a new trial.  It is unnecessary, of course, to deal with the sentence
    appeals.</p>
