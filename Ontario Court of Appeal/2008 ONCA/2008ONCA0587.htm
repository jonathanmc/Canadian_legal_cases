  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>A.        INTRODUCTION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    August 2007 a liquidity crisis suddenly threatened the Canadian market in
    Asset Backed Commercial Paper (“ABCP”).  The crisis was triggered by a loss
    of confidence amongst investors stemming from the news of widespread defaults
    on
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">U.S.</st1:country-region>
    sub-prime mortgages.  The loss of confidence placed the Canadian financial
    market at risk generally and was reflective of an economic volatility worldwide.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    agreement amongst the major Canadian participants, the $32 billion Canadian
    market in third-party ABCP was frozen on August 13, 2007 pending an attempt
    to resolve the crisis through a restructuring of that market.  The Pan-Canadian
    Investors Committee, chaired by Purdy Crawford, C.C., Q.C., was formed and
    ultimately put forward the creditor-initiated Plan of Compromise and Arrangement
    that forms the subject-matter of these proceedings.  The Plan was sanctioned
    by Colin L. Campbell J. on June 5, 2008.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Certain
    creditors who opposed the Plan seek leave to appeal and, if leave is granted,
    appeal from that decision.  They raise an important point regarding the permissible
    scope of a restructuring under the <i>Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act</i>,
    R.S.C. 1985, c. C-36 as amended (“CCAA”): can the court sanction a Plan that
    calls for creditors to provide releases to third parties who are themselves
    solvent and not creditors of the debtor company?  They also argue that, if
    the answer to this question is yes, the application judge erred in holding
    that this Plan, with its particular releases (which bar some claims even
    in fraud), was fair and reasonable and therefore in sanctioning it under
    the CCAA.</p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>    Leave to Appeal</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
    of the particular circumstances and urgency of these proceedings, the court
    agreed to collapse an oral hearing for leave to appeal with the hearing of
    the appeal itself.  At the outset of argument we encouraged counsel to combine
    their submissions on both matters.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    proposed appeal raises issues of considerable importance to restructuring
    proceedings under the CCAA Canada-wide.  There are serious and arguable grounds
    of appeal and – given the expedited time-table – the appeal will not unduly
    delay the progress of the proceedings. I am satisfied that the criteria for
    granting leave to appeal in CCAA proceedings, set out in such cases as <i>Re
    Cineplex Odeon Corp.</i> (2001), 24 C.B.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 201 (Ont. C.A.),
    and <i>Re Country Style Food Services</i> (2002), 158 O.A.C. 30, are met.  I
    would grant leave to appeal.</p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>    Appeal</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, however, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>B.        FACTS</span></h4>
  <h3>The Parties</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants are holders of ABCP Notes who oppose the Plan. They do so principally
    on the basis that it requires them to grant releases to third party financial
    institutions against whom they say they have claims for relief arising out
    of their purchase of ABCP Notes.  Amongst them are an airline, a tour operator,
    a mining company, a wireless provider, a pharmaceuticals retailer, and several
    holding companies and energy companies.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Each
    of the appellants has large sums invested in ABCP
    – in some cases, hundreds of millions of dollars.  Nonetheless, the collective
    holdings of the appellants – slightly over $1 billion – represent only a
    small fraction of the more than $32 billion of ABCP involved in the restructuring.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    lead respondent is the Pan-Canadian Investors Committee which was responsible
    for the creation and negotiation of the Plan on behalf of the creditors.  Other
    respondents include various major international financial institutions, the
    five largest Canadian banks, several trust companies, and some smaller holders
    of ABCP product.  They participated in the market in a number of different
    ways.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:
normal'><span lang=EN-US>The ABCP Market</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Asset
    Backed Commercial Paper is a sophisticated and hitherto well-accepted financial
    instrument.  It is primarily a form of short-term investment – usually 30
    to 90 days
    – typically with a low interest yield only slightly better than that available
    through other short-term paper from a government or bank.  It is said to
    be “asset backed” because the cash that is used to purchase an ABCP Note
    is converted into a portfolio of financial assets or other asset interests
    that in turn provide security for the repayment of the notes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>ABCP
    was often presented by those selling it as a safe investment, somewhat like
    a guaranteed investment certificate.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Canadian market for ABCP is significant and administratively complex.  As
    of August 2007, investors had placed over $116 billion in Canadian ABCP.  Investors
    range from individual pensioners to large institutional bodies.  On the selling
    and distribution end, numerous players are involved, including chartered
    banks, investment houses and other financial institutions.  Some of these
    players participated in multiple ways.  The Plan in this proceeding relates
    to approximately $32 billion of non-bank sponsored ABCP the restructuring
    of which is considered essential to the preservation of the Canadian ABCP
    market.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I understand it, prior to August 2007 when it was frozen, the ABCP market
    worked as follows.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Various
    corporations (the “Sponsors”) would arrange for entities they control (“Conduits”)
    to make ABCP Notes available to be sold to investors through “Dealers” (banks
    and other investment dealers).  Typically, ABCP was issued by series and
    sometimes by classes within a series. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    cash from the purchase of the ABCP Notes was used to purchase assets which
    were held by trustees of the Conduits (“Issuer Trustees”) and which stood
    as security for repayment of the notes.  Financial institutions that sold
    or provided the Conduits with the assets that secured the ABCP are known
    as “Asset Providers”.  To help ensure that investors would be able to redeem
    their notes, “Liquidity Providers” agreed to provide funds that could be
    drawn upon to meet the demands of maturing ABCP Notes in certain circumstances.  Most
    Asset Providers were also Liquidity Providers.  Many of these banks and financial
    institutions were also holders of ABCP Notes (“Noteholders”).  The Asset
    and Liquidity Providers held first charges on the assets.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    the market was working well, cash from the purchase of new ABCP Notes was
    also used to pay off maturing ABCP Notes; alternatively, Noteholders simply
    rolled their maturing notes over into new ones.  As I will explain, however,
    there was a potential underlying predicament with this scheme.</p>
  <h3>The Liquidity Crisis</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    types of assets and asset interests acquired to
    “back” the ABCP Notes are varied and complex.  They were generally long-term
    assets such as residential mortgages, credit card receivables, auto loans,
    cash collateralized debt obligations and derivative investments such as credit
    default swaps.  Their particular characteristics do not matter for the purpose
    of this appeal, but they shared a common feature that proved to be the Achilles
    heel of the ABCP market: because of their long-term nature there was an inherent
    timing mismatch between the cash they generated and the cash needed to repay
    maturing ABCP Notes.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    uncertainty began to spread through the ABCP marketplace in the summer of
    2007, investors stopped buying the ABCP product and existing Noteholders
    ceased to roll over their maturing notes.  There was no cash to redeem those
    notes.  Although calls were made on the Liquidity Providers for payment,
    most of the Liquidity Providers declined to fund the redemption of the notes,
    arguing that the conditions for liquidity funding had not been met in the
    circumstances.  Hence the “liquidity crisis” in the ABCP market.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    crisis was fuelled largely by a lack of transparency in the ABCP scheme.  Investors
    could not tell what assets were backing their notes – partly because the
    ABCP Notes were often sold before or at the same time as the assets backing
    them were acquired; partly because of the sheer complexity of certain of
    the underlying assets; and partly because of assertions of confidentiality
    by those involved with the assets.  As fears arising from the spreading
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">U.S.</st1:country-region>
    sub-prime mortgage crisis mushroomed, investors became increasingly concerned
    that their ABCP Notes may be supported by those crumbling assets.  For the
    reasons outlined above, however, they were unable to redeem their maturing
    ABCP Notes.</p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>The

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    liquidity crisis could have triggered a wholesale liquidation of the assets,
    at depressed prices.  But it did not.  During the week of August 13, 2007,
    the ABCP market in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region

    froze – the result of a standstill arrangement orchestrated on the heels
    of the crisis by numerous market participants, including Asset Providers,
    Liquidity Providers, Noteholders and other financial industry representatives.  Under
    the standstill agreement – known as the Montréal Protocol – the parties committed
    to restructuring the ABCP market with a view, as much as possible, to preserving
    the value of the assets and of the notes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    work of implementing the restructuring fell to the Pan-Canadian Investors
    Committee, an applicant in the proceeding and respondent in the appeal.  The
    Committee is composed of 17 financial and investment institutions, including
    chartered banks, credit unions, a pension board, a Crown corporation, and
    a university board of governors. All 17 members are themselves Noteholders;
    three of them also participated in the ABCP market in other capacities as
    well. Between them, they hold about two thirds of the $32 billion of ABCP
    sought to be restructured in these proceedings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Crawford was named the Committee’s chair.  He thus had a unique vantage point
    on the work of the Committee and the restructuring process as a whole.  His
    lengthy affidavit strongly informed the application judge’s understanding
    of the factual context, and our own.  He was not cross-examined and his evidence
    is unchallenged.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Beginning
    in September 2007, the Committee worked to craft a plan that would preserve
    the value of the notes and assets, satisfy the various stakeholders to the
    extent possible, and restore confidence in an important segment of the Canadian
    financial marketplace.  In March 2008, it and the other applicants sought
    CCAA protection for the ABCP debtors and the approval of a Plan that had
    been pre-negotiated with some, but not all, of those affected by the misfortunes
    in the Canadian ABCP market.</p>
  <h3>The Plan</h3>
  <h3><span
style='font-weight:normal'>a) <u>Plan Overview</u></span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the ABCP market involves many different players and kinds of assets, each
    with their own challenges, the committee opted for a single plan.  In Mr.
    Crawford’s words, “all of the ABCP suffers from common problems that are
    best addressed by a common solution.” The Plan the Committee developed is
    highly complex and involves many parties.  In its essence, the Plan would
    convert the Noteholders’ paper – which has been frozen and therefore effectively
    worthless for many months – into new, long-term notes that would trade freely,
    but with a discounted face value.  The hope is that a strong secondary market
    for the notes will emerge in the long run.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Plan aims to improve transparency by providing investors with detailed information
    about the assets supporting their ABCP Notes. It also addresses the timing
    mismatch between the notes and the assets by adjusting the maturity provisions
    and interest rates on the new notes. Further, the Plan adjusts some of the
    underlying credit default swap contracts by increasing the thresholds for
    default triggering events; in this way, the likelihood of a forced liquidation
    flowing from the credit default swap holder’s prior security is reduced and,
    in turn, the risk for ABCP investors is decreased. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under
    the Plan, the vast majority of the assets underlying ABCP would be pooled
    into two master asset vehicles (MAV1 and MAV2). The pooling is designed to
    increase the collateral available and thus make the notes more secure. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Plan does not apply to investors holding less than $1 million of notes.  However,
    certain Dealers have agreed to buy the ABCP of those of their customers holding
    less than the $1-million threshold, and to extend financial assistance to
    these customers.  Principal among these Dealers are National Bank and Canaccord,
    two of the respondent financial institutions the appellants most object to
    releasing.  The application judge found that these developments appeared
    to be designed to secure votes in favour of the Plan by various Noteholders,
    and were apparently successful in doing so.  If the Plan is approved, they
    also provide considerable relief to the many small investors who find themselves
    unwittingly caught in the ABDP collapse.  </p>
  <h3><span style='font-weight:normal'>b) <u>The Releases</u></span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    appeal focuses on one specific aspect of the Plan: the comprehensive series
    of releases of third parties provided for in Article 10. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Plan calls for the release of Canadian banks, Dealers, Noteholders, Asset
    Providers, Issuer Trustees, Liquidity Providers, and other market participants – in
    Mr. Crawford’s words, “virtually all participants in the Canadian ABCP market” – from
    any liability associated with ABCP, with the exception of certain narrow
    claims relating to fraud.  For instance, under the Plan as approved, creditors
    will have to give up their claims against the Dealers who sold them their
    ABCP Notes, including challenges to the way the Dealers characterized the
    ABCP and provided (or did not provide) information about the ABCP.  The claims
    against the proposed defendants are mainly in tort: negligence, misrepresentation,
    negligent misrepresentation, failure to act prudently as a dealer/advisor,
    acting in conflict of interest, and in a few cases fraud or potential fraud.  There
    are also allegations of breach of fiduciary duty and claims for other equitable
    relief.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge found that, in general, the claims for damages include
    the face value of the Notes, plus interest and additional penalties and damages. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    releases, in effect, are part of a <i>quid pro quo</i>.  Generally speaking,
    they are designed to compensate various participants in the market for the
    contributions they would make to the restructuring.  Those contributions
    under the Plan include the requirements that:</p>
  <p>a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Asset
    Providers assume an increased risk in their credit default swap contracts,
    disclose certain proprietary information in relation to the assets, and provide
    below-cost financing for margin funding facilities that are designed to make
    the notes more secure;</p>
  <p>b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sponsors
    – who in addition have cooperated with the Investors’ Committee throughout
    the process, including by sharing certain proprietary information – give
    up their existing contracts;</p>
  <p>c)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Canadian
    banks provide below-cost financing for the margin funding facility and,</p>
  <p>d)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Other parties
    make other contributions under the Plan.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According
    to Mr. Crawford’s affidavit, the releases are part of the Plan “because certain
    key participants, whose participation is vital to the restructuring, have
    made comprehensive releases a condition for their participation.” </p>
  <h3 style='page-break-after:avoid'>The CCAA Proceedings to Date</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    March 17, 2008 the applicants sought and obtained an Initial Order under
    the CCAA staying any proceedings relating to the ABCP crisis and providing
    for a meeting of the Noteholders to vote on the proposed Plan.  The meeting
    was held on April 25<sup>th</sup>.  The vote was overwhelmingly in support
    of the Plan – 96% of the Noteholders voted in favour.  At the instance of
    certain Noteholders, and as requested by the application judge (who has supervised
    the proceedings from the outset), the Monitor broke down the voting results
    according to those Noteholders who had worked on or with the Investors’ Committee
    to develop the Plan and those Noteholders who had not.  Re-calculated on
    this basis the results remained firmly in favour of the proposed Plan – 99%
    of those connected with the development of the Plan voted positively, as
    did 80% of those Noteholders who had not been involved in its formulation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    vote thus provided the Plan with the “double majority” approval – a majority
    of creditors representing two-thirds in value of the claims – required under
    s. 6 of the CCAA.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    the successful vote, the applicants sought court approval of the Plan under
    s. 6.  Hearings were held on May 12 and 13.  On May 16, the application judge
    issued a brief endorsement in which he concluded that he did not have sufficient
    facts to decide whether all the releases proposed in the Plan were authorized
    by the CCAA.  While the application judge was prepared to approve the releases
    of negligence claims, he was not prepared at that point to sanction the release
    of fraud claims.  Noting the urgency of the situation and the serious consequences
    that would result from the Plan’s failure, the application judge nevertheless
    directed the parties back to the bargaining table to try to work out a claims
    process for addressing legitimate claims of fraud. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    result of this renegotiation was a “fraud carve-out” – an amendment to the
    Plan excluding certain fraud claims from the Plan’s releases.  The carve-out
    did not encompass all possible claims of fraud, however.  It was limited
    in three key respects. First, it applied only to claims against ABCP Dealers.  Secondly,
    it applied only to cases involving an express fraudulent misrepresentation
    made with the intention to induce purchase and in circumstances where the
    person making the representation knew it to be false.  Thirdly, the carve-out
    limited available damages to the value of the notes, minus any funds distributed
    as part of the Plan.  The appellants argue vigorously that such a limited
    release respecting fraud claims is unacceptable and should not have been
    sanctioned by the application judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    second sanction hearing – this time involving the amended Plan (with the
    fraud carve-out) – was held on June 3, 2008.  Two days later, Campbell J.
    released his reasons for decision, approving and sanctioning the Plan on
    the basis both that he had jurisdiction to sanction a Plan calling for third-party
    releases and that the Plan including the third-party releases in question
    here was fair and reasonable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants attack both of these determinations.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There

    to that question is yes, did the application judge err in the exercise of

    of the releases called for under it?</p>
  <h3>(1)            Legal Authority for the Releases</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    standard of review on this first issue – whether, as a matter of law, a CCAA
    plan may contain third-party releases – is correctness.</p>

  <p><u>    Interpretation, “Gap Filling” and Inherent Jurisdiction</u></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    a proper interpretation, in my view, the CCAA permits the inclusion of third
    party releases in a plan of compromise or arrangement to be sanctioned by
    the court where those releases are reasonably connected to the proposed restructuring.  I
    am led to this conclusion by a combination of (a) the open-ended, flexible
    character of the CCAA itself, (b) the broad nature of the term “compromise
    or arrangement” as used in the Act, and (c) the express statutory effect
    of the
    “double-majority” vote and court sanction which render the plan binding on <u>all</u> creditors,
    including those unwilling to accept certain portions of it.  The first of
    these signals a flexible approach to the application of the Act in new and
    evolving situations, an active judicial role in its application and interpretation,
    and a liberal approach to that interpretation.  The second provides the entrée
    to negotiations between the parties affected in the restructuring and furnishes
    them with the ability to apply the broad scope of their ingenuity in fashioning
    the proposal.  The latter afford necessary protection to unwilling creditors
    who may be deprived of certain of their civil and property rights as a result
    of the process. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    CCAA is skeletal in nature.  It does not contain a comprehensive code that
    lays out all that is permitted or barred.  Judges must therefore play a role
    in fleshing out the details of the statutory scheme.  The scope of the Act
    and the powers of the court under it are not limitless.  It is beyond controversy,
    however, that the CCAA is remedial legislation to be liberally construed
    in accordance with the modern purposive approach to statutory interpretation.  It
    is designed to be a flexible instrument and it is that very flexibility which
    gives the Act its efficacy: <i>Canadian Red Cross Society (Re)</i> (1998),
    5 C.B.R. (4th) 299 (Ont. Gen. Div.).  As Farley J. noted in <i>Re Dylex Ltd.</i> (1995),
    31 C.B.R. (3d) 106 at 111 (Ont. Gen. Div.), “[t]he history of CCAA law has
    been an evolution of judicial interpretation.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Much
    has been said, however, about the “evolution of judicial interpretation” and
    there is some controversy over both the source and scope of that authority.  Is
    the source of the court’s authority statutory, discerned solely through application
    of the principles of statutory interpretation, for example? Or does it rest
    in the court’s ability to “fill in the gaps” in legislation? Or in the court’s
    inherent jurisdiction?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    issues have recently been canvassed by the Honourable Georgina R. Jackson
    and Dr. Janis Sarra in their publication
    “Selecting the Judicial Tool to get the Job Done: An Examination of Statutory
    Interpretation, Discretionary Power and Inherent Jurisdiction in Insolvency
    Matters,”<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a> and there was considerable argument on these issues
    before the application judge and before us.  While I generally agree with
    the authors’ suggestion that the courts should adopt a hierarchical approach
    in their resort to these interpretive tools – statutory interpretation, gap-filling,
    discretion and inherent jurisdiction – it is not necessary in my view to
    go beyond the general principles of statutory interpretation to resolve the
    issues on this appeal.  Because I am satisfied that it is implicit in the
    language of the CCAA itself that the court has authority to sanction plans
    incorporating third-party releases that are reasonably related to the proposed
    restructuring, there is no “gap-filling” to be done and no need to fall back
    on inherent jurisdiction.  In this respect, I take a somewhat different approach
    than the application judge did.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Supreme Court of Canada has affirmed generally –
    and in the insolvency context particularly – that remedial statutes are to
    be interpreted liberally and in accordance with Professor Driedger’s modern
    principle of statutory interpretation.  Driedger advocated that “the words
    of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical
    and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of
    the Act, and the intention of Parliament”: <i>Re Rizzo &amp; Rizzo Shoes
    Ltd</i>., [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27 at para. 21, quoting E.A. Driedger, <i>Construction
    of Statutes</i>, 2nd ed. (Toronto: Butterworths, 1983); <i>Bell Expressvu
    Ltd. Partnership v. R.</i>, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559 at para. 26.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More
    broadly, I believe that the proper approach to the judicial interpretation
    and application of statutes – particularly those like the CCAA that are skeletal
    in nature – is succinctly and accurately summarized by Jackson and Sarra
    in their recent article, <i>supra</i>, at p. 56:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The exercise of a statutory authority requires
    the statute to be construed.  The plain meaning or textualist approach has
    given way to a search for the object and goals of the statute and the intentionalist
    approach.  This latter approach makes use of the purposive approach and the
    mischief rule, including its codification under interpretation statutes that
    every enactment is deemed remedial, and is to be given such fair, large and
    liberal construction and interpretation as best ensures the attainment of
    its objects.  This latter approach advocates reading the statute as a whole
    and being mindful of Driedger’s “one principle”, that the words of the Act
    are to be read in their entire context, in their grammatical and ordinary
    sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and
    the intention of Parliament.  It is important that courts first interpret
    the statute before them and exercise their authority pursuant to the statute,
    before reaching for other tools in the judicial toolbox.  Statutory interpretation
    using the principles articulated above leaves room for gap-filling in the
    common law provinces and a consideration of purpose in <i>Québec</i> as a
    manifestation of the judge’s overall task of statutory interpretation.  Finally,
    the jurisprudence in relation to statutory interpretation demonstrates the
    fluidity inherent in the judge’s task in seeking the objects of the statute
    and the intention of the legislature.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    remedial purpose of the CCAA – as its title affirms
    – is to facilitate compromises or arrangements between an insolvent debtor
    company and its creditors.  In <i>Chef Ready Foods Ltd. v. Hongkong Bank
    of Canada </i>(1990), 4 C.B.R. (3d) 311 at 318 (B.C.C.A.), Gibbs J.A. summarized
    very concisely the purpose, object and scheme of the Act <b>:</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Almost inevitably, liquidation destroyed the shareholders’ investment,
    yielded little by way of recovery to the creditors, and exacerbated the social
    evil of devastating levels of unemployment.  The government of the day sought,
    through the C.C.A.A., to create a regime whereby the principals of the company
    and the creditors could be brought together under the supervision of the
    court to attempt a reorganization or compromise or arrangement under which
    the company could continue in business.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    CCAA was enacted in 1933 and was necessary – as the then Secretary of State
    noted in introducing the Bill on First Reading—“because of the prevailing
    commercial and industrial depression” and the need to alleviate the effects
    of business bankruptcies in that context: see the statement of the Hon. C.H.
    Cahan, Secretary of State, <i>House of Commons Debates (Hansard)</i> (April
    20, 1933) at 4091.  One of the greatest effects of that Depression was what
    Gibbs J.A. described as “the social evil of devastating levels of unemployment”.  Since
    then, courts have recognized that the Act has a broader dimension than simply
    the direct relations between the debtor company and its creditors and that
    this broader public dimension must be weighed in the balance together with
    the interests of those most directly affected: see, for example, <i>Elan
    Corp. v. Comiskey (Trustee of)</i> (1990), 1 O.R. (3d) 289 (C.A.), <i>per</i> Doherty
    J.A. in dissent; <i>Re Skydome Corp. </i>(1998), 16 C.B.R. (4<sup>th</sup>)

    interpretation of the CCAA that recognizes its broader socio-economic purposes
    and objects is apt in this case.  As the application judge pointed out, the
    restructuring underpins the financial viability of the Canadian ABCP market
    itself.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants argue that the application judge erred in taking this approach
    and in treating the Plan and the proceedings as an attempt to restructure
    a financial market (the ABCP market) rather than simply the affairs between
    the debtor corporations who caused the ABCP Notes to be issued and their
    creditors.  The Act is designed, they say, only to effect reorganizations
    between a corporate debtor and its creditors and not to attempt to restructure
    entire marketplaces.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    perspective is flawed in at least two respects, however, in my opinion.  First,
    it reflects a view of the purpose and objects of the CCAA that is too narrow.  Secondly,
    it overlooks the reality of the ABCP marketplace and the context of the restructuring
    in question here.  It may be true that, in their capacity as ABCP <i>Dealers</i>,
    the releasee financial institutions are “third-parties” to the restructuring
    in the sense that they are not creditors of the debtor corporations.  However,
    in their capacities as <i>Asset Providers</i> and <i>Liquidity Providers</i>,
    they are not only creditors but they are prior secured creditors to the Noteholders.  Furthermore – as
    the application judge found – in these latter capacities they are making
    significant contributions to the restructuring by “foregoing immediate rights
    to assets and … providing real and tangible input for the preservation and
    enhancement of the Notes” (para. 76).  In this context, therefore, the application
    judge’s remark at para. 50 that the restructuring “involves the commitment
    and participation of all parties” in the ABCP market makes sense, as do his
    earlier comments at paras. 48-49:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Given the nature of the ABCP market and all of
    its participants, it is more appropriate to consider all Noteholders as claimants
    and the object of the Plan to restore liquidity to the assets being the Notes
    themselves.  The restoration of the liquidity of the market necessitates
    the participation (including more tangible contribution by many) of all Noteholders.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In these circumstances, <i>it is unduly technical
      to classify the Issuer Trustees as debtors and the claims of the Noteholders
      as between themselves and others as being those of third party creditors</i>,
      although I recognize that the restructuring structure of the CCAA requires
      the corporations as the vehicles for restructuring. [Emphasis added.] </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge did observe that “[t]he insolvency is of the ABCP market
    itself, the restructuring is that of the market for such paper …” (para.
    50).  He did so, however, to point out the uniqueness of the Plan before
    him and its industry-wide significance and not to suggest that he need have
    no regard to the provisions of the CCAA permitting a restructuring as between
    debtor and creditors.  His focus was on <i>the effect</i> of the restructuring,
    a perfectly permissible perspective, given the broad purpose and objects
    of the Act.  This is apparent from his later references.  For example, in
    balancing the arguments against approving releases that might include aspects
    of fraud, he responded that “what is at issue is a liquidity crisis that
    affects the ABCP market in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    ”
    (para. 125).  In addition, in his reasoning on the fair-and-reasonable issue,
    he stated at para. 142:  “Apart from the Plan itself, there is a need to
    restore confidence in the financial system in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    and this Plan is a legitimate use of the CCAA to accomplish that goal.”  </p>

    agree.  I see no error on the part of the application judge in approaching
    the fairness assessment or the interpretation issue with these considerations
    in mind.  They provide the context in which the purpose, objects and scheme

    in my view, is to be found in: </p>
  <p>a)      the skeletal nature of the CCAA;</p>

    establish the framework within which the parties may work to put forward
    a restructuring plan; and in</p>
  <p>c)      the creation of the statutory mechanism binding all creditors in
    classes to the compromise or arrangement once it has surpassed the high “double
    majority”
    voting threshold and obtained court sanction as “fair and reasonable”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>            Therein lies

    corporate insolvencies in the public interest.  Parliament wisely avoided
    attempting to anticipate the myriad of business deals that could evolve from
    the fertile and creative minds of negotiators restructuring their financial
    affairs.  It left the shape and details of those deals to be worked out within
    the framework of the comprehensive and flexible concepts of a “compromise” and “arrangement.”  I

    therefore, a plan of compromise or arrangement may propose that creditors
    agree to compromise claims against the debtor and to release third parties,
    just as any debtor and creditor might agree to such a term in a contract
    between them.  Once the statutory mechanism regarding voter approval and
    court sanctioning has been complied with, the plan – including the provision
    for releases – becomes binding on all creditors (including the dissenting

      T&amp;N Ltd. and Others, supra, </i>is instructive in this regard.  It
      is a rare example of a court focussing on and examining the meaning and
      breadth of the term “arrangement”.  T&amp;N and its associated companies
      were engaged in the manufacture, distribution and sale of asbestos-containing
      products.  They became the subject of many claims by former employees,
      who had been exposed to asbestos dust in the course of their employment,
      and their dependents.  The T&amp;N companies applied for protection under
      s. 425 of the U.K. <i>Companies Act 1985</i>, a provision virtually identical
      to the scheme of the CCAA – including the concepts of compromise or arrangement.<a

    carried employers’ liability insurance.  However, the employers’ liability
    insurers (the “EL insurers”) denied coverage.  This issue was litigated and
    ultimately resolved through the establishment of a multi-million pound fund
    against which the employees and their dependants (the “EL claimants”) would
    assert their claims.  In return, T&amp;N’s former employees and dependants
    (the “EL claimants”) agreed to forego any further claims against the EL insurers.  This
    settlement was incorporated into the plan of compromise and arrangement between
    the T&amp;N companies and the EL claimants that was voted on and put forward
    for court sanction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Certain
    creditors argued that the court could not sanction the plan because it did
    not constitute a “compromise or arrangement”
    between T&amp;N and the EL claimants since it did not purport to affect rights
    as between them but only the EL claimants’ rights against the EL insurers.  The
    Court rejected this argument.  Richards J. adopted previous jurisprudence –
    cited earlier in these reasons – to the effect that the word “arrangement” has
    a very broad meaning and that, while both a compromise and an arrangement
    involve some “give and take”, an arrangement need not involve a compromise
    or be confined to a case of dispute or difficulty (paras. 46-51).  He referred
    to what would be the equivalent of a solvent arrangement under Canadian corporate
    legislation as an example.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[5]</span></span></span></a>  Finally, he pointed out that the compromised
    rights of the EL claimants against the EL insurers were not unconnected with
    the EL claimants’ rights against the T&amp;N companies; the scheme of arrangement
    involving the EL insurers was “an integral part of a single proposal affecting
    all the parties” (para. 52).  He concluded his reasoning with these observations
    (para. 53):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my judgment it is not a necessary element of
    an arrangement for the purposes of s 425 of the 1985 Act that it should alter
    the rights existing between the company and the creditors or members with
    whom it is made.  No doubt in most cases it will alter those rights.  But,
    provided that the context and content of the scheme are such as properly
    to constitute an arrangement between the company and the members or creditors
    concerned, it will fall within s 425.  It is … neither necessary nor desirable
    to attempt a definition of arrangement.  The legislature has not done so.  To
    insist on an alteration of rights, or a termination of rights as in the case
    of schemes to effect takeovers or mergers, is to impose a restriction which
    is neither warranted by the statutory language nor justified by the courts’ approach
    over many years to give the term its widest meaning.  <i>Nor is an arrangement
    necessarily outside the section, because its effect is to alter the rights
    of creditors against another party or because such alteration could be achieved
    by a scheme of arrangement with that party</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    find Richard J.’s analysis helpful and persuasive.  In effect, the claimants
    in <i>T&amp;N</i> were being asked to release their claims against the EL
    insurers in exchange for a call on the fund.  Here, the appellants are being
    required to release their claims against certain financial third parties
    in exchange for what is anticipated to be an improved position for all ABCP
    Noteholders, stemming from the contributions the financial third parties
    are making to the ABCP restructuring.  The situations are quite comparable.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Parliament’s
    reliance on the expansive terms
    “compromise” or “arrangement” does not stand alone, however.  Effective insolvency
    restructurings would not be possible without a statutory mechanism to bind
    an unwilling minority of creditors.  Unanimity is frequently impossible in
    such situations.  But the minority must be protected too.  Parliament’s solution
    to this quandary was to permit a wide range of proposals to be negotiated
    and put forward (the compromise or arrangement) and to bind <u>all</u> creditors
    by class to the terms of the plan, but to do so only where the proposal can
    gain the support of the requisite “double majority”
    of votes<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span

    the basis that it is fair and reasonable.  In this way, the scheme of the
    CCAA supports the intention of Parliament to encourage a wide variety of
    solutions to corporate insolvencies without unjustifiably overriding the
    rights of dissenting creditors.</p>
  <h3><i><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    keeping with this scheme and purpose, I do not suggest that any and all releases
    between creditors of the debtor company seeking to restructure and third
    parties may be made the subject of a compromise or arrangement between the
    debtor and its creditors. Nor do I think the fact that the releases may be “necessary” in
    the sense that the third parties or the debtor may refuse to proceed without
    them, of itself, advances the argument in favour of finding jurisdiction
    (although it may well be relevant in terms of the fairness and reasonableness
  analysis).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    release of the claim in question must be justified as part of the compromise
    or arrangement between the debtor and its creditors.  In short, there must
    be a reasonable connection between the third party claim being compromised
    in the plan and the restructuring achieved by the plan to warrant inclusion
    of the third party release in the plan.  This nexus exists here, in my view. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In

  <p>e)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Plan
    will benefit not only the debtor companies but creditor Noteholders generally. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,
    then – as was the case in <i>T&amp;N</i> – there is a close connection between
    the claims being released and the restructuring proposal.  The tort claims
    arise out of the sale and distribution of the ABCP Notes and their collapse
    in value, just as do the contractual claims of the creditors against the
    debtor companies.  The purpose of the restructuring is to stabilize and shore
    up the value of those notes in the long run.  The third parties being released
    are making separate contributions to enable those results to materialize.  Those
    contributions are identified earlier, at para. 31 of these reasons.  The
    application judge found that the claims being released are not independent
    of or unrelated to the claims that the Noteholders have against the debtor
    companies; they are closely connected to the value of the ABCP Notes and
    are required for the Plan to succeed.  At paras. 76-77 he said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[76] I do not consider that the Plan in this case
    involves a change in relationship among creditors “that does not directly
    involve the Company.”  Those who support the Plan and are to be released
    are “directly involved in the Company” in the sense that many are foregoing
    immediate rights to assets and are providing real and tangible input for
    the preservation and enhancement of the Notes.  It would be unduly restrictive
    to suggest that the moving parties’ claims against released parties do not
    involve the Company, since the claims are directly related to the value of
    the Notes.  The value of the Notes is in this case the value of the Company.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[77] This Plan, as it deals with releases, doesn’t
    change the relationship of the creditors apart from involving the Company
    and its Notes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    am satisfied that the wording of the CCAA – construed in light of the purpose,
    objects and scheme of the Act and in accordance with the modern principles
    of statutory interpretation – supports the court’s jurisdiction and authority
    to sanction the Plan proposed here, including the contested third-party releases
    contained in it.

    were referred to at least a dozen court-approved CCAA plans from across the
    country that included broad third-party releases.  With the exception of <i>Re
    Canadian Airlines</i>, however, the releases in those restructurings – including <i>Muscle
    Tech</i> – were not opposed.  The appellants argue that those cases are wrongly
    decided, because the court simply does not have the authority to approve
    such releases.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Re
      Canadian Airlines</i> the releases in question were opposed, however.  Paperny
      J. (as she then was) concluded the court had jurisdiction to approve them
      and her decision is said to be the well-spring of the trend towards third-party
      releases referred to above.  Based on the foregoing analysis, I agree with
      her conclusion although for reasons that differ from those cited by her.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justice
    Paperny began her analysis of the release issue with the observation at para.
    87 that “[p]rior to 1997, the CCAA did not provide for compromises of claims
    against anyone other than the petitioning company.”  It will be apparent
    from the analysis in these reasons that I do not accept that premise, notwithstanding
    the decision of the Quebec Court of Appeal in <i>Michaud v. Steinberg,</i><a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[7]</span></span></span></a> of which her comment may have been reflective.  Paperny
    J.’s reference to 1997 was a reference to the amendments of that year adding
    s. 5.1 to the CCAA, which provides for limited releases in favour of directors.  Given
    the limited scope of s. 5.1, Justice Paperny was thus faced with the argument – dealt
    with later in these reasons – that Parliament must not have intended to extend
    the authority to approve third-party releases beyond the scope of this section.  She
    chose to address this contention by concluding that, although the amendments “[did]
    not authorize a release of claims against third parties other than directors,
    [they did] not prohibit such releases either” (para. 92).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Respectfully,
    I would not adopt the interpretive principle that the CCAA permits releases
    because it does not expressly prohibit them.  Rather, as I explain in these
    reasons, I believe the open-ended CCAA permits third-party releases that
    are reasonably related to the restructuring at issue because they are encompassed
    in the comprehensive terms “compromise” and “arrangement” and because of
    the double-voting majority and court sanctioning statutory mechanism that
    makes them binding on unwilling creditors.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants rely on a number of authorities, which they submit support the
    proposition that the CCAA may not be used to compromise claims as between
    anyone other than the debtor company and its creditors.  Principal amongst
    these are <i>Michaud v. Steinberg</i>, <i>supra</i>; <i>NBD Bank, Canada
    v. Dofasco Inc.</i>, (1999), 46 O.R. (3d) 514 (
    <st1:country-region

      <st1:place

      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) (“<i>Stelco I</i>”).  I do not think these cases assist the appellants,
    however.  With the exception of <i>Steinberg</i>, they do not involve third
    party claims that were reasonably connected to the restructuring.  As I shall
    explain, it is my opinion that <i>Steinberg </i>does not express a correct
    view of the law, and I decline to follow it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Pacific
      Coastal Airlines</i>, Tysoe J. made the following comment at para. 24:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[The purpose of the CCAA proceeding] is not to
    deal with disputes between a creditor of a company and a third party, even
    if the company was also involved in the subject matter of the dispute.  While
    issues between the debtor company and non-creditors are sometimes dealt with
    in CCAA<i> </i>proceedings, it is not a proper use of a CCAA proceeding to
    determine disputes between parties other than the debtor company.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    statement must be understood in its context, however.  Pacific Coastal Airlines
    had been a regional carrier for Canadian Airlines prior to the CCAA reorganization
    of the latter in 2000.  In the action in question it was seeking to assert
    separate tort claims against Air Canada for contractual interference and
    inducing breach of contract in relation to certain rights it had to the use
    of Canadian’s flight designator code prior to the CCAA proceeding.  Air
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    sought to have the action dismissed on grounds of <i>res judicata</i> or
    issue estoppel because of the CCAA proceeding.  Tysoe J. rejected the argument.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    facts in <i>Pacific Coastal</i> are not analogous to the circumstances of
    this case, however.  There is no suggestion that a resolution of Pacific
    Coastal’s separate tort claim against Air
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    was in any way connected to the Canadian Airlines restructuring, even though
    Canadian – at a contractual level – may have had some involvement with the
    particular dispute.  Here, however, the disputes that are the subject-matter
    of the impugned releases are not simply “disputes between parties other than
    the debtor company”.  They are closely connected to the disputes being resolved
    between the debtor companies and their creditors and to the restructuring
    itself.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor
    is the decision of this Court in the <i>NBD Bank</i> case dispositive.  It
    arose out of the financial collapse of Algoma Steel, a wholly-owned subsidiary
    of Dofasco.  The Bank had advanced funds to Algoma allegedly on the strength
    of misrepresentations by Algoma’s Vice-President, James Melville.  The plan
    of compromise and arrangement that was sanctioned by Farley J. in the Algoma
    CCAA restructuring contained a clause releasing Algoma from all claims creditors
    “may have had against Algoma or its directors, officers, employees and advisors.”  Mr.
    Melville was found liable for negligent misrepresentation in a subsequent
    action by the Bank.  On appeal, he argued that since the Bank was barred
    from suing Algoma for misrepresentation by its officers, permitting it to
    pursue the same cause of action against him personally would subvert the
    CCAA process – in short, he was personally protected by the CCAA release.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rosenberg
    J.A., writing for this Court, rejected this argument.  The appellants here
    rely particularly upon his following observations at paras. 53-54:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>53  <span
lang=EN>&nbsp;In my view, the appellant has not demonstrated that allowing the
      respondent to pursue its claim against him would undermine or subvert the
      purposes of the Act. As this court noted in <i>Elan Corp. v. Comiskey</i> <span style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none;text-underline:
none'>(1990), 1 O.R. (3d) 289</span> at 297, the <i>CCAA</i> is remedial
      legislation &quot;intended to provide a structured environment for the
      negotiation of compromises between a debtor company and its creditors for
      the benefit of both&quot;. It is a means of avoiding a liquidation that
      may yield little for the creditors, especially unsecured creditors like
      the respondent, and the debtor company shareholders. However, the appellant
      has not shown that allowing a creditor to continue an action against an
      officer for negligent misrepresentation would erode the effectiveness of
      the Act.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=bold1><span lang=EN

      fact, to refuse on policy grounds to impose liability on an officer of
      the corporation for negligent misrepresentation would contradict the policy
      of Parliament as demonstrated in recent amendments to the <i>CCAA</i> and
      the <i>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3. Those Acts
      now contemplate that an arrangement or proposal may include a term for
      compromise of certain types of claims against directors of the company
      except claims that &quot;are based on allegations of misrepresentations
      made by directors&quot;. L.W. Houlden and C.H. Morawetz, the editors of <i>The
      2000 Annotated Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</i> (Toronto: Carswell, 1999)
      at p. 192 are of the view that the policy behind the provision is to encourage
      directors of an insolvent corporation to remain in office so that the affairs
      of the corporation can be reorganized. I can see no similar policy interest
      in barring an action against an officer of the company who, prior to the
      insolvency, has misrepresented the financial affairs of the corporation
      to its creditors. It may be necessary to permit the compromise of claims
      against the debtor corporation, otherwise it may not be possible to successfully
      reorganize the corporation. The same considerations do not apply to individual
      officers. Rather, it would seem to me that it would be contrary to good
      policy to immunize officers from the consequences of their negligent statements
      which might otherwise be made in anticipation of being forgiven under a
      subsequent corporate proposal or arrangement. [Footnote omitted.] </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once
    again, this statement must be assessed in context.  Whether Justice Farley
    had the authority in the earlier Algoma CCAA proceedings to sanction a plan
    that included third party releases was not under consideration at all.  What
    the Court was determining in <i>NBD Bank</i> was whether the release extended
    by its terms to protect a third party.  In fact, on its face, it does not
    appear to do so.  Justice Rosenberg concluded only that not allowing Mr.
    Melville to rely upon the release did not subvert the purpose of the CCAA.  As
    the application judge here observed, “there is little factual similarity
    in <i>NBD</i> to the facts now before the Court” (para. 71).  Contrary to
    the facts of this case, in <i>NBD Bank</i> the creditors had not agreed to
    grant a release to officers; they had not voted on such a release and the
    court had not assessed the fairness and reasonableness of such a release
    as a term of a complex arrangement involving significant contributions by
    the beneficiaries of the release – as is the situation here.  Thus, <i>NBD
    Bank </i>is of little assistance in determining whether the court has authority
    to sanction a plan that calls for third party releases.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants also rely upon the decision of this Court in <i>Stelco I</i>.   There,
    the Court was dealing with the scope of the CCAA in connection with a dispute
    over what were called the “Turnover Payments”.  Under an inter-creditor agreement
    one group of creditors had subordinated their rights to another group and
    agreed to hold in trust and “turn over” any proceeds received from Stelco
    until the senior group was paid in full.  On a disputed classification motion,
    the Subordinated Debt Holders argued that they should be in a separate class
    from the Senior Debt Holders.   Farley J. refused to make such an order in
    the court below, stating:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[Sections] 4, 5 and 6 [of the CCAA] talk of compromises
    or arrangements between a company and its creditors.  There is no mention
    of this extending by statute to encompass a change of relationship among
    the creditors vis-à-vis the creditors themselves <i>and not directly involving
    the company</i>. [Citations omitted; emphasis added.] </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>See <i>Re Stelco Inc. </i>(2005), 15 C.B.R. (5th)
    297 (Ont. S.C.J.) at para. 7.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    Court upheld that decision.  The legal relationship between each group of
    creditors and Stelco was the same, albeit there were inter-creditor differences,
    and creditors were to be classified in accordance with their legal rights.  In
    addition, the need for timely classification and voting decisions in the
    CCAA process militated against enmeshing the classification process in the
    vagaries of inter-corporate disputes.  In short, the issues before the Court
    were quite different from those raised on this appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Indeed,
    the Stelco plan, as sanctioned, included third party releases (albeit uncontested
    ones).  This Court subsequently dealt with the same inter-creditor agreement
    on an appeal where the Subordinated Debt Holders argued that the inter-creditor
    subordination provisions were beyond the reach of the CCAA and therefore
    that they were entitled to a separate civil action to determine their rights
    under the agreement: <i>Re Stelco Inc.</i>, (2006), 21 C.B.R. (5<sup>th</sup>)
    157 (Ont. C.A.) (“<i>Stelco II”)</i>.  The Court rejected that argument and
    held that where the creditors’ rights amongst themselves were sufficiently
    related to the debtor and its plan, they were properly brought within the
    scope of the CCAA plan.  The Court said (para. 11):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In [<i>Stelco I</i>]
    – the classification case – the court observed that it is not a proper use
    of a CCAA proceeding to determine disputes between parties other than the
    debtor company … <i>[H]owever, the present case is not simply an inter-creditor
    dispute that does not involve the debtor company;</i> <i>it is a dispute
    that is inextricably connected to the restructuring process</i>. [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    approach I would take to the disposition of this appeal is consistent with
    that view.  As I have noted, the third party releases here are very closely
    connected to the ABCP restructuring process.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Some
    of the appellants – particularly those represented by Mr. Woods – rely heavily
    upon the decision of the Quebec Court of Appeal in <i>Michaud v. Steinberg,
    supra</i>.  They say that it is determinative of the release issue.  In <i>Steinberg</i>,
    the Court held that the CCAA, as worded at the time, did not permit the release
    of directors of the debtor corporation and that third-party releases were
    not within the purview of the Act.  Deschamps J.A. (as she then was) said
    (paras. 42, 54 and 58 – English translation):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[42] Even if one can understand the extreme pressure
    weighing on the creditors and the respondent at the time of the sanctioning,
    a plan of arrangement is not the appropriate forum to settle disputes other
    than the claims that are the subject of the arrangement.  In other words,
    one cannot, under the pretext of an absence of formal directives in the Act,
    transform an arrangement into a potpourri. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:
center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[54] The Act offers the respondent a way to arrive
    at a compromise with is creditors.  It does not go so far as to offer an
    umbrella to all the persons within its orbit by permitting them to shelter
    themselves from any recourse.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:
center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[58] The [CCAA] and the case law clearly do not
    permit extending the application of an arrangement to persons other than
    the respondent and its creditors and, consequently, the plan should not have
    been sanctioned as is [that is, including the releases of the directors].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justices
    Vallerand and Delisle, in separate judgments, agreed.  Justice Vallerand
    summarized his view of the consequences of extending the scope of the CCAA
    to third party releases in this fashion (para. 7):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In short, the Act will have become the Companies’ <i>and
      Their Officers and Employees</i> Creditors Arrangement Act – an awful mess – and
      likely not attain its purpose, which is to enable the company to survive
      in the face of <i>its</i> creditors and through their will, and not in
      the face of the creditors of its officers.  This is why I feel, just like
      my colleague, that such a clause is contrary to the Act’s mode of operation,
      contrary to its purposes and, for this reason, is to be banned.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justice
    Delisle, on the other hand, appears to have rejected the releases because
    of their broad nature – they released directors from all claims, including
    those that were altogether unrelated to their corporate duties with the debtor
    company – rather than because of a lack of authority to sanction under the
    Act.  Indeed, he seems to have recognized the wide range of circumstances
    that could be included within the term “compromise or arrangement”.  He is
    the only one who addressed that term.  At para. 90 he said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The CCAA is drafted in general terms.  It does
    not specify, among other things, what must be understood by “compromise or
    arrangement”.  However, it may be inferred from the purpose of this [A]ct
    that these terms <i>encompass all that should enable the person who has recourse
    to it to fully dispose of his debts</i>, both those that exist on the date
    when he has recourse to the statute and <i>those contingent on the insolvency
    in which he finds himself</i> … [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    decision of the Court did not reflect a view that the terms of a compromise
    or arrangement should “encompass all that should enable the person who has
    recourse to [the Act] to dispose of his debts … and those contingent on the
    insolvency in which he finds himself,” however.  On occasion such an outlook
    might embrace third parties other than the debtor and its creditors in order
    to make the arrangement work.  Nor would it be surprising that, in such circumstances,
    the third parties might seek the protection of releases, or that the debtor
    might do so on their behalf.  Thus, the perspective adopted by the majority
    in <i>Steinberg</i>, in my view, is too narrow, having regard to the language,
    purpose and objects of the CCAA and the intention of Parliament.  They made
    no attempt to consider and explain why a compromise or arrangement could
    not include third-party releases.  In addition, the decision appears to have
    been based, at least partly, on a rejection of the use of contract-law concepts
    in analysing the Act – an approach inconsistent with the jurisprudence referred
    to above.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the majority in <i>Steinberg</i> seems to have proceeded on the basis that
    the CCAA cannot interfere with civil or property rights under
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Quebec law.  Mr. Woods advanced this argument before this Court in his factum,
    but did not press it in oral argument.  Indeed, he conceded that if the Act
    encompasses the authority to sanction a plan containing third-party releases – as
    I have concluded it does –
    the provisions of the CCAA, as valid federal insolvency legislation, are
    paramount over provincial legislation.  I shall return to the constitutional
    issues raised by the appellants later in these reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    to the extent <i>Steinberg</i> stands for the proposition that the court
    does not have authority under the CCAA to sanction a plan that incorporates
    third-party releases, I do not believe it to be a correct statement of the
    law and I respectfully decline to follow it.  The modern approach to interpretation
    of the Act in accordance with its nature and purpose militates against a
    narrow interpretation and towards one that facilitates and encourages compromises
    and arrangements.  Had the majority in <i>Steinberg</i> considered the broad
    nature of the terms “compromise” and
    “arrangement” and the jurisprudence I have referred to above, they might
    well have come to a different conclusion.  </p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>The 1997 Amendments</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Steinberg</i> led
    to amendments to the CCAA, however.  In 1997, s. 5.1 was added, dealing specifically
    with releases pertaining to directors of the debtor company. It states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>5.1<b> </b>(1)
    A compromise or arrangement made in respect of a debtor company may include
    in its terms provision for the compromise of claims against directors of
    the company that arose before the commencement of proceedings under this

    are by law liable in their capacity as directors for the payment of such
    obligations. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2) A provision for the compromise of claims against

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(<i>a</i>) relate to contractual rights of one
    or more creditors; or</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(<i>b</i>) are based on allegations of misrepresentations
    made by directors to creditors or of wrongful or oppressive conduct by directors.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='"codese\:5_1-ss\:_3_"'><span style='color:windowtext;
'>Powers of court</span></span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3) The court may declare that a claim against

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span

'>Resignation or removal of directors</span></span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(4) Where all of the directors have resigned or

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Perhaps
    the appellants’ strongest argument is that these amendments confirm a prior
    lack of authority in the court to sanction a plan including third party releases.  If
    the power existed, why would Parliament feel it necessary to add an amendment
    specifically permitting such releases (subject to the exceptions indicated)
    in favour of directors?  <i>Expressio unius est exclusio alterius</i>, is
    the Latin maxim sometimes relied on to articulate the principle of interpretation
    implied in that question: to express or include one thing implies the exclusion
    of the other. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    maxim is not helpful in these circumstances, however.  The reality is that
    there <i>may</i> be another explanation why Parliament acted as it did.  As

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Far from being a rule, [the maxim <i>expressio
      unius</i>] is not even lexicographically accurate, because it is simply
      not true, generally, that the mere express conferral of a right or privilege
      in one kind of situation implies the denial of the equivalent right or
      privilege in other kinds.  Sometimes it does and sometimes its does not,
      and whether it does or does not depends on the particular circumstances
      of context.  Without contextual support, therefore there is not even a
      mild presumption here.  Accordingly, the maxim is at best a description,
      after the fact, of what the court has discovered from context.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I have said, the 1997 amendments to the CCAA providing for releases in favour
    of directors of debtor companies in limited circumstances were a response
    to the decision of the Quebec Court of Appeal in <i>Steinberg</i>.  A similar
    amendment was made with respect to proposals in the BIA at the same time.  The
    rationale behind these amendments was to encourage directors of an insolvent
    company to remain in office during a restructuring, rather than resign.  The
    assumption was that by remaining in office the directors would provide some
    stability while the affairs of the company were being reorganized: see Houlden
    &amp; Morawetz, vol.1, <i>supra, </i>at 2-144, E§11A; <i>Le Royal Penfield
    Inc. </i><i><span lang=FR-CA>(Syndic de)</span></i><span lang=FR-CA>, [2003]

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Parliament
    thus had a particular focus and a particular purpose in enacting the 1997
    amendments to the CCAA and the BIA.  While there is some merit in the appellants’
    argument on this point, at the end of the day I do not accept that Parliament
    intended to signal by its enactment of s. 5.1 that it was depriving the court
    of authority to sanction plans of compromise or arrangement in all circumstances
    where they incorporate third party releases in favour of anyone other than
    the debtor’s directors.  For the reasons articulated above, I am satisfied
    that the court does have the authority to do so.  Whether it sanctions the
    plan is a matter for the fairness hearing.</p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>    The Deprivation of Proprietary Rights</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Shapray very effectively led the appellants’
    argument that legislation must not be construed so as to interfere with or
    prejudice established contractual or proprietary rights – including the right
    to bring an action – in the absence of a clear indication of legislative
    intention to that effect: <i>Halsbury’s Laws of England</i>, 4<sup>th</sup> ed.
    reissue, vol. 44 (1) (London:
    <st1:PersonName
w:st="on">
    Butterworths, 1995) at paras. 1438, 1464 and 1467; Driedger, 2<sup>nd</sup> ed., <i>supra, </i>at
    183; Ruth Sullivan, <i>Sullivan and Driedger on the Construction of Statutes</i>,

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Markham: Butterworths, 2002) at 399.  I accept the importance of this principle.  For
    the reasons I have explained, however, I am satisfied that Parliament’s intention
    to clothe the court with authority to consider and sanction a plan that contains
    third party releases is expressed with sufficient clarity in the “compromise
    or arrangement” language of the CCAA coupled with the statutory voting and
    sanctioning mechanism making the provisions of the plan binding on all creditors.  This
    is not a situation of impermissible
    “gap-filling” in the case of legislation severely affecting property rights;
    it is a question of finding meaning in the language of the Act itself.  I
    would therefore not give effect to the appellants’ submissions in this regard.</p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>The Division of Powers and Paramountcy</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Woods and Mr. Sternberg submit that extending the reach of the CCAA process
    to the compromise of claims as between solvent creditors of the debtor company
    and solvent third parties to the proceeding is constitutionally impermissible.  They
    say that under the guise of the federal insolvency power pursuant to s. 91(21)
    of the <i>Constitution Act</i>, <i>1867</i>, this approach would improperly
    affect the rights of civil claimants to assert their causes of action, a
    provincial matter falling within s. 92(13), and contravene the rules of public
    order pursuant to the <i>Civil Code of Quebec</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not accept these submissions.  It has long been established that the CCAA
    is valid federal legislation under the federal insolvency power: <i>Reference
    re: Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    )</i>, [1934] S.C.R. 659.  As the Supreme Court confirmed in that case (p.
    661), citing Viscount Cave L.C. in <i>Royal Bank of Canada v. Larue </i>[1928]
    A.C. 187, “the exclusive legislative authority to deal with all matters within
    the domain of bankruptcy and insolvency is vested in Parliament.”  Chief
    Justice Duff elaborated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Matters normally constituting part of a bankruptcy
    scheme but not in their essence matters of bankruptcy and insolvency may,
    of course, from another point of view and in another aspect be dealt with
    by a provincial legislature; but, when treated as matters pertaining to bankruptcy
    and insolvency, they clearly fall within the legislative authority of the
    Dominion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    is exactly the case here.  The power to sanction a plan of compromise or
    arrangement that contains third-party releases of the type opposed by the
    appellants is embedded in the wording of the CCAA.  The fact that this may
    interfere with a claimant’s right to pursue a civil action – normally a matter
    of provincial concern – or trump Quebec rules of public order is constitutionally
    immaterial.  The CCAA is a valid exercise of federal power.  Provided the
    matter in question falls within the legislation directly or as necessarily
    incidental to the exercise of that power, the CCAA governs.  To the extent
    that its provisions are inconsistent with provincial legislation, the federal
    legislation is paramount.  Mr. Woods properly conceded this during argument.</p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>    Conclusion With Respect to Legal Authority</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    all of the foregoing reasons, then, I conclude that the application judge
    had the jurisdiction and legal authority to sanction the Plan as put forward.</p>
  <h3>(2)       The Plan is “Fair and Reasonable”</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second major attack on the application judge’s decision is that he erred
    in finding that the Plan is “fair and reasonable” and in sanctioning it on
    that basis.  This attack is centred on the nature of the third-party releases
    contemplated and, in particular, on the fact that they will permit the release
    of some claims based in fraud.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether
    a plan of compromise or arrangement is fair and reasonable is a matter of
    mixed fact and law, and one on which the application judge exercises a large
    measure of discretion.  The standard of review on this issue is therefore
    one of deference.  In the absence of a demonstrable error an appellate court
    will not interfere:  see <i>Re Ravelston Corp. Ltd.</i> (2007), 31 C.B.R.
    (5th) 233 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would not interfere with the application judge’s decision in this regard.  While
    the notion of releases in favour of third parties – including leading Canadian
    financial institutions – that extend to claims of fraud is distasteful, there
    is no legal impediment to the inclusion of a release for claims based in
    fraud in a plan of compromise or arrangement.  The application judge had
    been living with and supervising the ABCP restructuring from its outset.  He
    was intimately attuned to its dynamics.  In the end he concluded that the
    benefits of the Plan to the creditors as a whole, and to the debtor companies,
    outweighed the negative aspects of compelling the unwilling appellants to
    execute the releases as finally put forward.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge was concerned about the inclusion of fraud in the contemplated
    releases and at the May hearing adjourned the final disposition of the sanctioning
    hearing in an effort to encourage the parties to negotiate a resolution.  The
    result was the “fraud carve-out” referred to earlier in these reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants argue that the fraud carve-out is inadequate because of its narrow
    scope.  It (i) applies only to ABCP Dealers, (ii) limits the type of damages
    that may be claimed (no punitive damages, for example), (iii) defines “fraud”
    narrowly, excluding many rights that would be protected by common law, equity
    and the Quebec concept of public order, and (iv) limits claims to representations
    made directly to Noteholders. The appellants submit it is contrary to public
    policy to sanction a plan containing such a limited restriction on the type
    of fraud claims that may be pursued against the third parties.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    law does not condone fraud.  It is the most serious kind of civil claim.  There
    is therefore some force to the appellants’ submission.  On the other hand,
    as noted, there is no legal impediment to granting the release of an antecedent
    claim in fraud, provided the claim is in the contemplation of the parties
    to the release at the time it is given: <i>Fotinis Restaurant Corp. v. White
    Spot Ltd</i>. (1998), 38 B.L.R. (2d) 251 at paras. 9 and 18 (B.C.S.C.).  There
    may be disputes about the scope or extent of what is released, but parties
    are entitled to settle allegations of fraud in civil proceedings – the claims
    here  all being untested allegations of fraud – and to include releases of
    such claims as part of that settlement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[112]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge was alive to the merits of the appellants’ submissions.  He
    was satisfied in the end, however, that the need “to avoid the potential
    cascade of litigation that … would result if a broader ‘carve out’ were to
    be allowed”
    (para. 113) outweighed the negative aspects of approving  releases with the
    narrower carve-out provision. Implementation of the Plan, in his view, would
    work to the overall greater benefit of the Noteholders as a whole. I can
    find no error in principle in the exercise of his discretion in arriving
    at this decision.  It was his call to make.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[113]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    para. 71 above I recited a number of factual findings the application judge
    made in concluding that approval of the Plan was within his jurisdiction
    under the CCAA and that it was fair and reasonable.  For convenience, I reiterate
    them here – with two additional findings – because they provide an important
    foundation for his analysis concerning the fairness and reasonableness of
    the Plan.  The application judge found that:</p>
  <p>a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    parties to be released are necessary and essential to the restructuring of
    the debtor;</p>
  <p>b)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The claims
    to be released are rationally related to the purpose of the Plan and necessary
    for it;</p>
  <p>c)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Plan
    cannot succeed without the releases;</p>
  <p>d)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties
    who are to have claims against them released are contributing in a tangible
    and realistic way to the Plan;</p>
  <p>e)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Plan
    will benefit not only the debtor companies but creditor Noteholders generally;</p>
  <p>f)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    voting creditors who have approved the Plan did so with knowledge of the
    nature and effect of the releases; and that,</p>
  <p>g)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The releases
    are fair and reasonable and not overly broad or offensive to public policy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[114]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    findings are all supported on the record.  Contrary to the submission of
    some of the appellants, they do not constitute a new and hitherto untried “test” for
    the sanctioning of a plan under the CCAA.  They simply represent findings
    of fact and inferences on the part of the application judge that underpin
    his conclusions on jurisdiction and fairness.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants all contend that the obligation to release the third parties from
    claims in fraud, tort, breach of fiduciary duty, etc. is confiscatory and
    amounts to a requirement that they – as individual creditors – make the equivalent
    of a greater financial contribution to the Plan.  In his usual lively fashion,
    Mr. Sternberg asked us the same rhetorical question he posed to the application
    judge.  As he put it, how could the court countenance the compromise of what
    in the future might turn out to be fraud perpetrated at the highest levels
    of Canadian and foreign banks?  Several appellants complain that the proposed
    Plan is unfair to them because they will make very little additional recovery
    if the Plan goes forward, but will be required to forfeit a cause of action
    against third-party financial institutions that may yield them significant
    recovery.  Others protest that they are being treated unequally because they
    are ineligible for relief programs that Liquidity Providers such as Canaccord
    have made available to other smaller investors.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[116]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All
    of these arguments are persuasive to varying degrees when considered in isolation.  The
    application judge did not have that luxury, however.  He was required to
    consider the circumstances of the restructuring as a whole, including the
    reality that many of the financial institutions were not only acting as Dealers
    or brokers of the ABCP Notes (with the impugned releases relating to the
    financial institutions in these capacities, for the most part) but also as
    Asset and Liquidity Providers (with the financial institutions making significant
    contributions to the restructuring in these capacities).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    insolvency restructuring proceedings almost everyone loses something.  To
    the extent that creditors are required to compromise their claims, it can
    always be proclaimed that their rights are being unfairly confiscated and
    that they are being called upon to make the equivalent of a further financial
    contribution to the compromise or arrangement.  Judges have observed on a
    number of occasions that CCAA proceedings involve “a balancing of prejudices,” inasmuch
    as everyone is adversely affected in some fashion.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[118]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,
    the debtor corporations being restructured represent the issuers of the more
    than $32 billion in non-bank sponsored ABCP Notes.  The proposed compromise
    and arrangement affects that entire segment of the ABCP market and the financial
    markets as a whole.  In that respect, the application judge was correct in
    adverting to the importance of the restructuring to the resolution of the
    ABCP liquidity crisis and to the need to restore confidence in the financial
    system in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  He was required to consider and balance the interests of <u>all</u> Noteholders,
    not just the interests of the appellants, whose notes represent only about
    3% of that total.  That is what he did.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[119]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge noted at para. 126 that the Plan represented “a reasonable
    balance between benefit to all Noteholders and enhanced recovery for those
    who can make out specific claims in fraud” within the fraud carve-out provisions
    of the releases.  He also recognized at para. 134 that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>No Plan of this size and complexity could be expected
    to satisfy all affected by it.  The size of the majority who have approved
    it is testament to its overall fairness.  No plan to address a crisis of
    this magnitude can work perfect equity among all stakeholders.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[120]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view we ought not to interfere with his decision that the Plan is fair
    and reasonable in all the circumstances.</p>
