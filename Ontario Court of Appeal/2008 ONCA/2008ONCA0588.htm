  <h4><span lang=EN-US>A.        OVERVIEW</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Foleys, the Shamesses and the Town of Parry Sound litigated for 19 days over
    a 100-year old building, which the Town eventually demolished.  The building
    had three storeys and three units.  The Shamess family owned the western
    and middle units; the Foleys owned the eastern unit.  The Shamess units were
    rundown and unoccupied.  The Foley unit needed some repair, but tenants occupied
    the main floor and the top floor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the fall of 1994, the Town of Parry Sound issued notices of violation under
    its property standards by-law against both the Shamess and Foley units.  The
    owners repaired some but not all of the deficiencies.  By 1997, the Shamess
    units had further deteriorated.  The Town’s chief building official declared
    the entire building unsafe and ordered the owners to undertake short and
    long term repairs.  They did no repairs, prompting the Town to prohibit the
    use or occupancy of the building.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Town also tried to get the owners to agree on how to deal with the building.  They
    could not agree.  The Shamesses wanted to demolish the entire building.  The
    Foleys wanted the Shamess units demolished and their unit preserved at the
    expense of the Shamesses or the Town.  When neither the Shamesses nor the
    Foleys did any of the repairs that had been ordered, the Town served notice
    of its intention to demolish the building.  In September 2001, the entire
    building was demolished.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Foleys sued for damages for negligence and nuisance.  They claimed that the
    Shamesses’ failure to repair or demolish their units in response to the 1994
    notice, and the Town’s failure to enforce its property standards by-law,
    had deprived them of the use of their unit.  The trial judge found all parties
    negligent and apportioned liability 40 per cent to the Town, 40 per cent
    to the Shamesses and 20 per cent to the Foleys.  In essence, he found both
    the Town and the Shamesses liable for failing to act on the 1994 notice of
    violation.  In his opinion, by 1997 either the Town or the Shamesses should
    have demolished the Shamess units, leaving the Foley unit as a free-standing
    structure.  He fixed damages for loss of profit and loss of the building
    at $51,000.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    the Town and Shamesses appeal only on liability.  Each submits that the trial
    judge’s finding of liability was unreasonable.  The Town contends that it
    had no obligation to undertake a partial demolition of the building when
    the owners themselves did not agree to do so.  The Shamesses contend that
    they had no obligation to demolish only their units, which was a difficult
    and costly course of action.  The Foleys had cross-appealed on the trial
    judge’s apportionment of liability and dismissal of their claim for punitive
    damages, but abandoned the cross-appeal during oral argument.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, I would allow the Town’s appeal and dismiss the
    action against it.  I would dismiss the Shamesses’ appeal and reapportion
    liability 66&#8532; per cent to the Shamesses and 33&#8531; per cent to the
    Foleys.</p>

    Parry Sound Road– for many years.  The Shamesses were elderly and some were
    in poor health.  They took few steps to maintain the building, and, for example,
    had not taken out insurance on their units since 1988.  Over the years they
    tried to sell their interests but received no offers.</span></p>

      1995, the Shamess family transferred their interests in the building to
      Shamess Harbour Properties Limited, a company that they had incorporated
      the previous year.  They did so in part to make it easier to deal with
      their ownership interests, and in part to shield themselves from personal
      liability.  However, in fixing liability, the trial judge pierced the corporate
      veil and held the individual Shamess defendants liable.  No appeal has
      been taken from that holding.</span></p>

      Foleys first complained about the condition of the Shamess units in 1994,
      and they complained not to the Shamesses, but to the Town.  The Town responded
      to the complaint in early November 1994 by sending a by-law inspector to
      inspect the building. The inspector concluded that the Shamess units did
      not comply with the Town’s property standards by-law.  On November 18,
      1994, the Town sent a notice of violation to the Shamesses, setting out
      a long list of deficiencies that needed to be repaired to bring the units
      into compliance with the by-law.  The notice stipulated that the repair
      work “should be completed as soon as possible.”</span></p>

      trial judge found that in response to the notices of violation, the Shamesses
      did some demolition work to the outside of their building but did nothing
      further.  Most of the Town’s serious concerns were not remedied.  The trial
      judge also found that by March 1995, the Foleys had repaired some but not
      all of the deficiencies in their unit.</span></p>

      the next two years, the Town continued to monitor the Shamess units.  It
      wrote letters demanding that the deficiencies set out in the 1994 notice
      be repaired.  The Town imposed deadlines for the work to be done.  However,
      the deadlines passed and still the Shamesses undertook no remedial work.  They
      had apparently concluded that their units had no economic value.  They
      wanted the building demolished.  </span></p>

      9, 1996.  The trial judge found that from then until October 1997, the
      Town took no further action.  In October 1997, the Town’s chief by-law
      inspector concluded that the Shamess units “had deteriorated to such an
      extent as to pose a safety threat and extensive work needs to be accomplished
      immediately to remove the hazards.”  The trial judge’s finding of liability
      against the Town rested on its inaction during the period September 1996

      unit and the Shamesses’ units.  He did so in early October 1997.  After
      thoroughly inspecting the building, he told both the Foleys and the Shamesses
      that he had serious concerns about the structural integrity of the building.  Before
      making any order, however, he convened a meeting of the owners and their

      Este inspected the building in October 1997, declared it unsafe because

      the 13-month period from September 1996 to October 1997, when on his finding,
      the building continued to deteriorate.  He concluded that the Town ought
      to have enforced its property standards by-law during that period, and
      that its failure to do so contributed to the eventual demolition of the
      building.  At the same time, he found that “an enforcement proceeding would
      not have resulted in expensive repairs being carried out to the building.”  Instead,
      he found the Town negligent for failing to demolish the two Shamess units

      my view, finding the Town negligent for failing to undertake a partial
      demolition of the building was unreasonable. Although the Town owed a duty
      to the Foleys to enforce its property standards by-law, it owed no duty
      to them to undertake a partial demolition.  For it is one thing to say
      a municipality has a duty to enforce its by-laws.  The way it enforces
      them is quite another thing.  As I read the case law, a municipality has
      a broad discretion in determining how it will enforce its by-laws, as long
      as it acts reasonably and in good faith.  That makes common sense.  The
      manner of enforcement ought not to be left to the whims or dictates of
      property owners.  See <i>Froese v. Hik</i>, 1993 CanLII 2815 (B.C.S.C.)

      it seems to me that requiring the Town to spend its limited resources on
      what expert engineers conceded was a costly and challenging undertaking
      placed an unreasonable burden on this municipality.  If the Foleys wanted
      the building partially demolished and their unit left intact, they could
      have sought the Shamesses’ agreement to do so on appropriate terms, or

      view is supported by the reasons of Justice Spiegel on the Foleys’ application
      to set aside the Town’s demolition order. In dismissing that application,
      Justice Spiegel found that the Town had “acted with admirable fairness
      and reasonableness throughout.”  That finding contradicts the trial judge’s
      finding of negligence.  The Foleys seek to circumscribe Justice Spiegel’s
      finding by contending that it relates only to the period from October 1997
      onwards, whereas the trial judge’s finding of negligence relates to the
      earlier period, September 1996 to October 1997.  I do not read Justice
      Spiegel’s finding to be so limited.  Although we do not have the record
      of the material before him, presumably he was apprised of the history of
      the building, and the parties’ dealings with it, since at least 1988 when
      the Foleys purchased their unit.  He found that the Town had acted fairly

      would allow the Town’s appeal.  The Town had no duty to partially demolish
      the building when the owners, individually or collectively, would not agree
      to do so.  Moreover, imposing this duty on the Town is inconsistent with
      the earlier decision of H. Spiegel J., who found that the Town had acted
      reasonably throughout. The Town is entitled to its costs of the appeal
      in the amount of $11,000, inclusive of the Foleys’ abandoned cross-appeal,
      and of disbursements and G.S.T.  The Town is also entitled to its costs
      of the trial, which I remit for reassessment.</span></p>

      would dismiss the Shamess’s appeal.  The Shamesses had a duty to act reasonably
      toward their co-owners, the Foleys.  They breached that duty by failing
      to remedy the many serious deficiencies in their units set out in the Town’s
      November 1994 notice of violation.  I would reapportion degrees of fault
      so that the Shamesses are 66&#8532; per cent contributorily negligent and
      the Foleys are 33&#8531; per cent contributorily negligent.  The Foleys
      are entitled to their costs of the appeal against the Shamesses in the
      amount of $9,000, inclusive of their abandoned cross-appeal and of disbursements
      and G.S.T. </span></p>

    parties agreed that lost profit amounted to $3,000 per year for seven years
    from January 1998 to December 2004.  The trial judge assessed the value of
    the Foleys’ unit at $30,000, based on appraisal evidence.</p>
