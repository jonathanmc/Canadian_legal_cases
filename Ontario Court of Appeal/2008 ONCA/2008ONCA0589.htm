line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      This
    Crown appeal from acquittal involves issues of disclosure, the judge’s trial
    management power and defence counsel’s jury address.  The respondent was
    tried before MacDougall J. and a jury on charges of robbery, assault with
    a weapon, and uttering death threats.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    case turned on the credibility of the two complainants, Thomas McPhail and
    his 19-year old son, Matthew.  The defence attempted to paint the McPhails
    as incredible and unreliable witnesses, being drug users and, in the case
    of Matthew, an admitted liar.  The Crown argues that the trial judge made
    several errors: excluding certain medical evidence to explain one of Thomas’s
    injuries; refusing to permit the Crown to embark on a <i>voir dire</i> to
    admit a mostly exculpatory statement given by the respondent to the police;
    and failing to provide corrective instructions in light of an improper and
    inflammatory jury address by defence counsel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the following reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    prosecution version of events largely depends upon the narrative from the
    two complainants.  On July 31, 2006, the complainants met up with the respondent
    at the home of a drug dealer, Donnie Smaglinski.  Thomas sent his son into
    Donnie’s home to purchase some crack cocaine.  When Matthew emerged with
    the drugs, he was accompanied by the respondent.  The complainants had stored
    some property, including a computer, at the respondent’s home and the respondent
    insisted that the complainants come to his home to fix the computer.  Once
    at the home, Matthew examined the computer while Thomas went to the kitchen
    for some water.  Matthew immediately realized that the computer was not plugged
    in.  Once he plugged it in, it began to operate and as he turned to tell
    the respondent the computer was working, the respondent struck him in the
    arm with a three-foot long table leg that had a three-inch long bolt protruding
    from it.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent then went to the kitchen where he began to hit Thomas about the
    ribs, head, arms and leg with the table leg.  During the attack the respondent
    accused Thomas of “ripping him off” and “ripping off” Ruby MacKay, who was
    a friend of the respondent’s.  Matthew attempted to intervene in the attack
    on his father but the respondent pushed him out of the way and threatened
    him.  Matthew also called on the respondent’s common-law spouse to intervene
    but she refused.  In the course of the attack Thomas’ ring fell off his finger.  The
    respondent ordered Thomas to leave the ring and empty his pockets.  The respondent
    took some cash and the crack cocaine that had been purchased at Donnie’s
    home.  After threatening to kill the complainants if they went to the police
    or tried to retaliate, the respondent allowed them to leave.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    was unclear whether the complainants went immediately to the hospital.  Thomas
    thought they went home first; Matthew could not remember.  In any event,
    by 12:35 a.m. on August 1, 2006, the complainants were at the hospital where
    they were seen by an emergency room physician, Dr. Reid.  Matthew had injuries
    to his left arm that did not require any sutures.  Thomas’ injuries were
    more substantial.  He had bruising on his right arm, his clavicle bone was
    tender and ballotable (<i>i.e.</i> it moved up and down), he had a laceration
    extending from his forehead into his hairline that required staples and sutures
    and he was complaining of having difficulty breathing and feeling faint and
    dizzy.  His chest wall was tender and his ribs were bruised.  Dr. Reid ordered
    x-rays but they did not show any displaced fractures or a pneumothorax (collapsed
    lung).  The admissibility of some of Dr. Reid’s evidence concerning this
    x-ray forms the first ground of appeal and I will outline her evidence in
    further detail when I deal with that ground of appeal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ruby
    MacKay was called by Crown counsel.  She testified that some time in early
    August the respondent told her he had been in a fight with the complainants
    in which he had used a table leg.  He told her that when he hit Thomas with
    the table leg, his ring flew off his finger.  She said that Thomas had started
    the fight and the fight was over the respondent’s belief that Thomas had
    stolen some
    “pot” from him.  She also testified in cross-examination that some time later
    in August, Thomas’s acquaintance, Paul Calver, telephoned her.  She could
    hear Thomas in the background telling Calver what to say.  Thomas was saying
    he had biker connections and people should be aware of what they say and
    do.  While Thomas, through Calver, was telling her what to say at the trial,
    she did not provide any details in her testimony of what he told her.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent’s defence was that the complainants fabricated their evidence
    of the attack by him.  His common-law spouse testified that while there was
    a discussion between the respondent and the complainants about some money
    that the complainants owed him for storing their belongings, there was no
    physical altercation.  Another defence witness, who claimed to have been
    at Donnie’s house on July 31, testified that in fact the complainants returned
    to Donnie’s house sometime after the initial drug purchase by Matthew and
    at that time they were uninjured. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    the exception of the medical and police witnesses, all of the prosecution
    and defence witnesses had potential credibility issues.  The complainants
    were crack cocaine users and Thomas used his son Matthew to purchase drugs
    for him.  Matthew admitted lying about his drug use at the preliminary inquiry.  He
    also changed his evidence about his father’s ring.  At the preliminary inquiry
    he testified it was a sapphire ring, but after talking to his father he learned
    the ring had an onyx stone, and testified to that effect at the trial.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defence witnesses also had credibility problems.  They were part of the same
    subculture as the respondent and the complainants.  The respondent’s common-law
    spouse had a criminal record and she admitted lying to the police when she
    was interviewed about the attack.  The other defence witness was a crack
    cocaine user and at the time of the trial was facing charges arising out
    of an attack on her ex-boyfriend.  She too admitted lying to the police when
    she was interviewed about the events of July 31.</p>

line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I have indicated, when Thomas was x-rayed at the hospital on the early morning
    of August 1, the x-ray did not show a collapsed lung.  The only x-ray was
    taken while Thomas was lying down.  He returned to the hospital on August
    16 because he continued to have difficulty breathing.  He was seen at this
    time by Dr. Joyce who ordered further x-rays.  This time x-rays were taken
    while he was in various positions.  Thomas testified that Dr. Joyce compared
    the two sets of x-rays in his presence and told him that Dr. Reid had missed
    seeing that Thomas had a collapsed lung.  On consent, the two radiology reports
    relating to the August 1 and August 16 x-rays were filed as exhibits during
    Thomas’ evidence.  Defence counsel cross-examined Thomas and suggested to
    him that he had been in an altercation between the two hospital visits.  Thomas
    denied the suggestion.  This cross-examination took place on the second day
    of trial, June 5, 2007.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    following day, defence counsel concluded his cross-examination of Thomas
    and Crown counsel re-examined the witness.  In the absence of the jury, defence
    counsel then raised what he termed “disclosure issues” concerning Dr. Reid.  He
    complained that about three weeks earlier, the investigating officer had
    interviewed Dr. Reid and taken a videotaped statement.  While he had been
    given a summary of the interview, he had just been given a copy of the actual
    videotape that morning.  Second, Crown counsel had interviewed Dr. Reid the
    previous night and just provided him with notes of the interview that morning.  Defence
    counsel asked for an order precluding Dr. Reid from testifying because the
    Crown had breached its <i>Stinchcombe</i> (<i>R. v. Stinchcombe </i>(1991),
    68 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.)) disclosure obligations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the ensuing discussion between counsel and the trial judge, the dispute seemed
    to narrow down to two matters, which the defence characterized as opinion
    evidence.  First, whether Dr. Reid should be allowed to explain a phrase
    in the first radiology report:  “Limited views only could be obtained as
    the patient was uncooperative.” Second, whether Dr. Reid could explain why
    the radiologist did not see the collapsed lung on the August 1 x-ray.  It
    seems that Crown counsel had asked Dr. Reid about these two matters the night
    before as a result of the suggestion from defence counsel to Thomas that
    he had been in a fight between the two hospital visits.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    appreciate the controversy, it is necessary to reproduce a part of the radiology
    report:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><b>RIGHT CLAVICLE
      AND HUMERUS</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Limited views
    only could be obtained as the patient was uncooperative.  No abnormalities
    demonstrated.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><b>CHEST, SUPINE</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The heart size

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According
    to Crown counsel, Dr. Reid would explain that
    “uncooperative” simply meant that the patient was physically incapable of
    moving into the proper position for the x-ray because of the pain he was
    in.  Second, she would explain that unless the collapsed lung was extremely
    large it would not be detected from an x-ray taken when Thomas was in the
    supine position.  Following the second set of x-rays, Thomas was diagnosed
    with a
    “moderate pneumothorax”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Defence
    counsel’s opposition to the admissibility of these parts of Dr. Reid’s evidence
    seemed to centre on the 30-day notice period required by s. 657.3 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> where a party intends to call expert evidence.  He also pointed
    out that the respondent was in custody and he would be prejudiced by an adjournment
    of the trial, especially a 30-day adjournment.  Defence counsel acknowledged
    that he had spoken to Dr. Reid the morning of June 5, but he does not seem
    to have raised with her the issue of the reason why the collapsed lung was
    only revealed in the August 16 x-ray.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge ruled that Dr. Reid could only give evidence about her own observations
    and could not explain the terms
    “uncooperative” or “supine” on the radiologist’s report nor “the results
    of the two radiologists’ reports”.  The trial judge gave as his reason that
    these matters should have been disclosed to the defence at an earlier date.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    a brief adjournment, in an attempt to either clarify the ruling or narrow
    it, Crown counsel asked if he could question Dr. Reid about how she expected
    the x-rays to be taken and why it was significant that the radiologist report
    used the term “supine” in relation to the chest.  Defence counsel continued
    to oppose allowing Dr. Reid to testify in any way about the purpose of the
    x-rays or the manner in which they were to be taken.  The trial judge ruled
    as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><i>I consider
      it more a disclosure issue</i>, counsel. I certainly understand why the
      Crown wants to get this information in
    – at least part of it in, in any event – because, <i>on the face of it, these
    two radiologists’ reports are different and beg the questions as to why that
    is so. Therefore, it would seem to me it was incumbent upon the Crown to
    have that explained, either by the radiologist or by the doctor</i>. It may
    have been that Doctor Reid could have, as a result of the information in
    the Emergency Report, provided some details of what she was expecting to
    be done when she ordered the chest x-ray, but <i>that disclosure was not
    made</i>. Therefore, I am not going to allow her to testify as to what she
    expected to happen when she ordered the chest x-ray.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown
    counsel continued to argue with the trial judge and made submissions indicating
    that he had expected the trial to begin a week later and suggesting that
    the defence would have enough time to respond to Dr. Reid’s new evidence
    if the matter were adjourned for a day.  The trial judge, without calling
    on defence counsel to respond, gave a third ruling in which he confirmed
    his earlier view that this was a disclosure matter.  He also addressed the
    question of whether a brief adjournment could remedy this disclosure issue:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Under the circumstances,
    given the fact that the defendant is in custody and this is a relatively
    short trial and it is a jury matter, I am not going to hold the matter down
    for a day. I do not think anything could be accomplished in any event by
    doing that. So the doctor’s evidence will be restricted accordingly.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Reid testified and her evidence was limited in accordance with the trial
    judge’s ruling.  Later in the trial, an agreed statement of facts relating
    to the evidence of Dr. Vaughan, the radiologist who reviewed the x-rays,
    was placed before the jury.  The agreed statement of facts sets out that
    the August 16 x-ray was done while the patient was in an upright position
    and that the August 1 chest x-ray was done “while the patient was in the
    supine position or lying down”.  No information was provided to the jury
    as to the significance of the different positions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    complete the picture, defence counsel said the following in his jury address:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>All Doctor Reid
    established was that there were injuries. This is hardly confirmatory evidence.
    This doesn’t corroborate anything that the McPhails say. Doctor Vaughan tells
    us about the various positions that Tom was in for the two x-rays. <i>Now

    that difference in position may account for why the first set of x-rays did
    not show a collapsed lung and did not show a fractured rib, whereas the second

    Sopinka J. identified two fundamental purposes of disclosure.  First, he
    noted at p. 6 that the experience from the civil discovery regime demonstrated
    that “justice was better served when the element of surprise was eliminated
    from the trial and the parties were prepared to address issues on the basis
    of complete information of the case to be met”.  He then went on to explain
    why, because of different interests engaged in a criminal case, there was
    a principled basis for only requiring disclosure from the Crown.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    at p. 9, Sopinka J. identified the “overriding concern that failure to disclose
    impedes the ability of the accused to make full answer and defence”.  He
    then pointed out that this common law right had acquired a constitutional
    dimension as a result of the inclusion of the fundamental justice guarantee
    in s. 7 of the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.  </i>Further,
    the then recent findings of the Royal Commission on the Donald Marshall,
    Jr., prosecution had shown that lack of disclosure was an important factor
    in the conviction of an innocent man: see Nova Scotia, <i>Royal Commission
    on the Donald Marshall, Jr., Prosecution</i>, Vol. 1: Findings and Recommendations
    (Nova Scotia: Queen’s Printer, 1989).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since <i>Stinchcombe,</i> there
    have been many decisions from courts of all levels respecting the Crown’s
    disclosure obligations.  This process has not been without its problems and
    controversies.  This case is not the opportunity to attempt to rationalize
    all those decisions.  But, it seems to me that when a court is faced with
    an allegation of non-disclosure especially where the allegation comes up
    in the middle of the trial and threatens to derail the proceedings, it would
    be helpful to bear in mind the purposes identified by Sopinka&nbsp;J. in <i>Stinchcombe.</i>  Put
    simply, disclosure is a means to an end.  Full prosecution disclosure is
    to ensure that the accused receives a fair trial, that the accused has an
    adequate opportunity to respond to the prosecution case and that in the result
    the verdict is a reliable one.  However, <i>Stinchcombe</i> has not completely
    overhauled the paradigm of the adversary process in which trials are dynamic
    and as events unfold, prosecution and defence may find that they have to
    respond quickly to changes in strategy and changes from the expected testimony
    of witnesses.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, for the following reasons the trial judge mischaracterized the issue
    relating to Dr. Reid as a disclosure issue.  One cardinal principle of the
    disclosure obligation is that, subject to issues of privilege, the Crown
    is required to produce all relevant information in its possession.  Since <i>Stinchcombe</i>,
    the courts have taken a very broad view of relevancy and repeatedly urged
    the Crown to err on the side of disclosure: see <i>e.g.</i> <i>R. v.
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Wilson</i> (1994), 87 C.C.C. (3d) 115 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  However, the Crown cannot be expected to disclose information before
    trial whose relevancy first becomes apparent during the trial itself and
    the prosecution cannot be expected to disclose what it does not have.  As
    was accepted in
    <st1:place

    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <i>Wilson</i> at p. 120, “The Crown cannot be held to a standard of clairvoyance.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is no dispute that in this case Crown counsel only obtained the information
    about the significance of the term
    “uncooperative” and the possible explanation for the collapsed lung not being
    detected on the first x-ray after court on June 5.  He immediately disclosed
    this information to defence counsel the following morning.  In my view, Crown
    counsel was not in breach of his disclosure obligations.  I might take a
    different view if there was evidence that Crown counsel deliberately refrained
    from making inquiries because of a fear of what would be revealed or what
    he would then be required to disclose.  That situation, akin to wilful blindness,
    might well trigger an obligation on Crown counsel to make inquiries and,
    having failed to do so, make counsel in breach of his disclosure obligations.  I
    would leave that issue for another day.  The fact remains there was no evidence
    in this case that Crown counsel deliberately or even recklessly failed to
    make inquiries that would have led to Dr. Reid’s additional evidence.  In
    my view, it follows that Crown counsel was not in breach of his disclosure
    obligations and whatever remedy was warranted by the mid-trial disclosure
    of the disputed portion of Dr.&nbsp;Reid’s evidence could not be founded
    on disclosure principles.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
    if this was a disclosure issue, in my view, the remedy granted by the trial
    judge was inappropriate.  In oral argument in this court, counsel for the
    respondent returned to s. 657.3 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  That relatively
    new provision provides that, “For the purpose of promoting the fair, orderly
    and efficient presentation of the testimony of witnesses”, a party calling
    an expert witness must, at least thirty days before trial, “or within any
    other period fixed by the justice or judge”, provide the name of the witness,
    a description of the witness’s area of expertise and a statement of the qualifications
    of the proposed witness “as an expert”.  There is an additional obligation
    on Crown counsel to provide a copy of any report prepared by the witness
    or, if there is no report, a summary of the anticipated opinion of the expert “within
    a reasonable period before trial”.  If the prosecution has not complied with
    these obligations, under subsection (4) the trial judge may grant an adjournment
    and order compliance with the provision.  Subsection (5) gives the trial
    judge additional powers where there has been some compliance but the other
    party has not been able to adequately prepare.  For example, the trial judge
    may order further particulars or order the calling or recalling of any witness.  However,
    s. 657.3 does not give the trial judge the power to refuse to allow the expert
    witness to testify.  Thus, the remedy granted by the trial judge in this
    case was not authorized by s. 657.3.</p>

line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where
    a breach of the Crown’s disclosure obligation is made out to the extent that
    the accused’s s. 7 <i>Charter</i> right to make full answer and defence has
    been infringed, trial judges have at their disposal an arsenal of remedies
    ranging from a stay of proceedings in the most egregious cases, to ordering
    disclosure and subsidiary remedies such as ordering costs against the prosecution
    or adjourning the proceedings.  Further, in an appropriate case, the trial
    judge has the power to give the remedy adopted in this case of excluding
    the undisclosed evidence: see <i>R. v. O’Connor</i> (1995), 103 C.C.C. (3d)
    1 (S.C.C.) at para. 66, approving the use of innovative remedies as appropriate,
    including exclusion of evidence, as was done in <i>R. v. Xenos</i> (1991),
    70 C.C.C. (3d) 362 (Que.
    <st1:place w:st="on">

line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Any
    remedy for breach of the disclosure obligation must be responsive to the
    breach; the remedy must, in the words of s. 24(1), be
    “appropriate and just in the circumstances”.  In most cases, the appropriate
    remedy is to order disclosure and, if necessary, adjourn the case to allow
    the defence to conduct whatever further preparation or investigation may
    be necessitated by the disclosure.  In some cases, an adjournment may not
    be an appropriate or just remedy if the result would be to unreasonably delay
    the trial of an in-custody accused.  In such a case, an appropriate remedy
    could be exclusion of the undisclosed evidence.  However, the burden is on
    the accused to demonstrate that exclusion of the evidence was appropriate.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    there was a breach of the prosecution’s disclosure obligation, on this record,
    the remedy granted by the trial judge was unreasonable.  The information
    the Crown sought to obtain from Dr. Reid was limited and relatively straight-forward.  At
    the point where the issue arose there was no indication that a very brief
    adjournment or holding down Dr. Reid’s evidence until later in the trial
    would not have sufficed.  If defence counsel was able to demonstrate that
    he required further time to investigate or that he could not obtain expert
    advice to meet Dr. Reid’s additional evidence, the trial judge would be in
    a position to consider whether the appropriate remedy was to exclude that
    part of Dr. Reid’s evidence.  In making that determination, the trial judge
    would have to bear in mind the objectives of disclosure to which I alluded
    earlier.  Was this remedy appropriate to prevent the respondent from potentially
    being deprived of his right to make full answer and defence?  Put another
    way did the justice of the case require that this evidence be excluded because
    the accused was not able to address the issue on the basis of complete information
    of the case to be met?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I have said, I do not consider that this was a disclosure issue.  That, however,
    did not prevent the trial judge from exercising his power to manage the trial.  In <i>R.
    v. Felderhof</i> (2003), 180 C.C.C. (3d) 498 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) at para. 57, this court recognized a broad trial management power to promote
    the efficient use of court time and ensure that all parties are treated fairly.  However,
    excluding relevant and otherwise admissible evidence is an unusual exercise
    of the trial management power and, in my view, it should be plain and obvious
    that the circumstances require that remedy and that the usual remedies, such
    as a short adjournment, would not suffice.  On this record, for the same
    reasons that a <i>Charter</i> remedy of exclusion of evidence was not made
    out, in my view, exclusion of Dr.&nbsp;Reid’s additional evidence was not
    justified to manage the trial.</p>

line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is one further issue: whatever remedy is adopted, it should not lead to a
    distortion of the trial or leave the trier of fact with a misleading picture.  In
    this case, I have two concerns in that regard.  First, the trial judge’s
    ruling that Dr. Reid could not explain the term
    “uncooperative” in the x-ray context meant that the jury would naturally
    adopt the lay definition of the word and thus possibly be left with the misleading
    impression that Thomas had not cooperated with the x-ray technician.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    defence counsel was permitted to tell the jury that the “simplest explanation” for
    the difference in the two x-rays was that
    “something else happened after [the first x-ray]”.  The impact of this potentially
    misleading statement was exacerbated when it was repeated by the trial judge
    in his charge to the jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    conclude, in my view, the trial judge erred in refusing to permit Dr. Reid
    to testify about the meaning of “uncooperative” and the possible explanation
    for the fact that the August 1 x-ray did not detect a collapsed lung.  I
    will consider the impact of this error after I have dealt with the Crown’s
    other grounds of appeal.</p>

    with Dr. Reid’s evidence, some review of the chronology is necessary to understand
    the ground of appeal relating to the trial judge’s decision to exclude the
    respondent’s statement to the police.  On August 2,<sup>, </sup>2006, two
    days after the alleged assault, the respondent provided a videotaped statement
    to the police.  Although the statement was largely exculpatory, it did contain
    some parts that might have assisted the prosecution case.  For example, the
    respondent acknowledged that the McPhails had been at his home, that there
    was a problem with the computer which Matthew fixed and that he had just
    seen Ruby MacKay and he believed Thomas had stolen money from her.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the judicial pre-trial, Crown counsel indicated that he would not be leading
    the statement as part of the Crown’s case, but would be seeking a ruling
    that the statement was admissible so that it would be available for cross-examination
    of the respondent.  At the opening of the trial on Monday, June 4, when counsel
    were discussing timing issues, defence counsel repeated that this was still
    his understanding of the Crown’s position.  Defence counsel stated that if
    that was the case there would have to be a <i>voir dire</i>.  Crown counsel
    did not respond and did not indicate whether he would require a finding that
    the statement was voluntary.  The trial then continued with jury selection.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the end of proceedings on Wednesday, June 6, Crown counsel in the absence
    of the jury stated that he understood that if the Crown was not introducing
    the statement as part of the Crown’s case a <i>voir dire</i> would not be
    necessary since the defence would not be contesting the admissibility or
    voluntariness of the statement.  Crown counsel then stated that he was not
    going to introduce the statement as part of its case.  Accordingly, there
    would be no need for a <i>voir dire</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    by the next day, the Crown had changed its position.  It appears that Crown
    counsel had decided not to call Ruby MacKay and instead now wanted to lead
    the respondent’s statement to the police.  He acknowledged that there would
    now have to be a <i>voir dire</i> since the defence had only conceded the
    statement was admissible if it was only going to be used to cross-examine
    the respondent.  Defence counsel objected to the Crown being permitted to
    resile from its position.  The trial judge ruled as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I am not going
    to permit the Crown to resile from that position.  It is significant when
    the Crown takes a position on a case. It is significant, of course, when
    the Crown goes on the record as, “This is my position.” <i>The Defence is
    entitled to rely on that and plan its strategy and its decisions as to what
    they are going to do in terms of how they are going to approach defending
    the case. I am not satisfied that there are any unusual circumstances to
    permit the Crown to resile from that position</i>. So the Crown is going
    to be held to that position.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

    a result of this ruling, Crown counsel then reversed his decision and said
    he now wanted to call Ruby MacKay.  Defence counsel also objected to this
    change in the Crown’s position.  The trial judge ruled, however, that she
    could be called, especially bearing in mind that the defence was aware that
    the Crown had always intended to call Ms. MacKay.</p>

    my view, the trial judge did not err in refusing to permit Crown counsel
    to lead the respondent’s statement to the police.  Unlike Dr. Reid’s evidence,
    the respondent’s statement to the police was presumptively inadmissible.  Accordingly,
    Rule 30 of the <i>Superior Court of Justice Criminal Proceedings Rules</i>,
    S.I./92-99, applied and the Crown was <i>inter alia</i> required to give
    notice of its intention to admit this evidence.  Moreover, this was not a
    case where no notice or insufficient notice had been given; Crown counsel
    had indicated on more than one occasion that he did not intend to lead the
    statement as part of his case.  The respondent and the trial judge were entitled
    to rely upon that position and conduct the trial accordingly.  By the time
    Crown counsel indicated his change in position the principal Crown witnesses
    had testified.  Crown counsel’s change in position could have resulted in
    unnecessary disruption of the trial and at least an unfortunate delay in
    the trial while the <i>voir dire</i> was conducted.  </p>

    any event, the appellant has not established that the exclusion of the statement
    could have affected the verdict.  As a result of the trial judge’s ruling,
    Crown counsel reversed his position and called Ruby MacKay.  She was not
    a particularly friendly witness for the Crown and yet she testified to a
    highly incriminating statement by the respondent.  As indicated above, she
    testified that the respondent admitted hitting Thomas with a table leg and
    that his ring flew off his hand.  That statement was much more probative
    of guilt than the respondent’s exculpatory statement to the police, and corroborated
    the stories of the McPhails in important respects.</p>

    a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning was not required in this case did not prevent defence

    was open to the defence to argue that their evidence was unreliable because
    of the drug use on that day and that, as persons engaged in criminal conduct,
    they were not credible: see <i>R. v. Bradbury</i> (1973), 14 C.C.C. (2d)

    a related submission, the appellant submits that defence counsel should not
    have been permitted to refer to Thomas as a
    “crackhead” and both complainants as “cracked-out liars”.  The appellant
    submits that witnesses, no matter what their standing in the community, are
    entitled to be treated with respect and that submissions such as these can
    have the effect of further marginalizing already vulnerable members of the
    community such as drug users.  She submits that such terms are designed to
    inflame the sentiments of the jury and could leave the impression that such
    people are less worthy of protection by the law.  </p>

    agree with the appellant that terms such as
    “crackhead” that unnecessarily denigrate witnesses should be avoided.  In
    particular, I agree that the following part of defence counsel’s jury address
    was improper:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>At the end of
    it all, what are you left with?  Strip away all the lies.  Strip away all
    the rhetoric.  Strip away all the various stories, and what’s left?  What’s
    left is that a 250-pound man, he’s very strong, is alleged to have taken
    a grand-slam swing at a 125-pound <i>crackhead skull</i>, resulting in minor
    injuries.  I suggest to you, if Ken Horan had taken a full swing, a grand-slam
    swing, to Tom McPhail’s head, Tom McPhail would have at least been knocked
    unconscious.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    comment, which suggests that drug users are less worthy of protection by
    the law, is improper and potentially inflammatory.  Defence counsel could
    make his point just as effectively without resort to this kind of excessive
    rhetoric.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    other comment of “two cracked-out liars” is, in my view, less objectionable.  As
    I have said, the fact that the complainants were using crack cocaine the
    day of the attack was a legitimate basis for undermining their credibility.  While
    the term “cracked-out”, which defence counsel seems to have invented, is
    somewhat excessive, in the context of this case and tied as it was to credibility,
    it would not have had the effect of inflaming the jury or diverting them
    from their task of deciding the case on the evidence.  The defence witnesses
    were in much the same position as the complainants.  In fact, one of the
    important defence witnesses admitted using and trafficking in crack cocaine
    on the night of the assault.  Unlike the “cracked skull” comment, this comment
    was not a suggestion that the complainants were less worthy of protection
    only, that they were less credible.</p>

    conclude on the character issue, while the
    “crackhead skull” comment was unnecessary and improper, in my view it was
    not sufficiently serious that the prosecution was deprived of a fair trial.  Most
    of the “crack” language used by defence counsel was part of a legitimate
    attack on the credibility of the complainants.</p>
  <h3><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman";'>(c)  <i>The role of Crown
        counsel</i></span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the most serious concerns with the jury address relate to the attack
    on Crown counsel.  The appellant submits that in his jury address, defence
    counsel repeatedly denigrated the role of the Crown by suggesting that prosecutors
    will say or do anything to win a case, even suborn perjury.  This submission
    is based on these aspects of defence counsel’s jury address:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>What do you
    think about the strength of the prosecutor’s case, that he has to resort
    to witnesses like this to try and convict someone? The prosecutor presented
    these types of witnesses to you. He is asking you to convict a man, based
    on this type of evidence. How does that make you feel? How does it make you
    feel that the prosecutor will stand up here, in front of your face, and have
    the audacity to ask the twelve of you to believe those people?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>He’s going to
    stand up here very shortly, and he’s going to say these are minor things.
    He’s going to say, for instance, that Matt lied about his drug use because
    he was scared of telling [on] people who sold him the drugs; he didn’t want
    to reveal that information. Well, ask yourselves this: Did he provide that
    information? Did he say who sold him the drugs? He said it wasn’t Donnie.
    He just said it was some black gentleman who was at Donnie’s house. He didn’t
    give up any information, did he? So what is he scared of?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The prosecutor
    will also likely stand here and tell you that the inconsistencies between
    Tom and Matt aren’t very relevant. <i>Prosecutors like to say that, at least
    in respect to Crown witnesses. They like to sing a different tune when talking
    about defence witnesses. And this prosecutor will likely be no different
    from all the others.</i> They like to say things like,
    “Well, the timing of the events doesn’t matter. What matters is that they’re
    consistent that some sort of assault took place.” Well, when two witnesses
    who both claim to have been involved in the exact same incident have such
    diametrically opposed stories, how can that possibly be a minor thing? As
    they say, “The devil’s in the details.”</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>These two so-called
    witnesses should probably face charges for perjury, obstruction, and contempt
    of court.  Instead the prosecutor is going to ask you to believe them.  [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    the extent that defence counsel was suggesting that Crown counsel was suborning
    perjury or that he, like all prosecutors, will go to any lengths, including
    resort to unfair or illegal tactics, to obtain a conviction, the comments
    were unfair and improper: see <i>Felderhof</i> at para. 79.  There was absolutely
    nothing in the record to support these implied allegations of misconduct.  Although
    the following comment from <i>R. v. Siu</i> (1998), 124 C.C.C. (3d) 301 (B.C.C.A.)
    at para. 70, was said in relation to Crown counsel’s address, it applies
    with equal force to defence counsel:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>It is the proper
    role of the advocate to attack the evidence, or arguments based on the evidence,
    or the lack of evidence.  <i>But it is no part of the advocate’s role to
    malign defence counsel, or to suggest that counsel’s conduct is deceptive
    and dishonourable.  </i>If there were any foundation to such suggestions,
    there are proper avenues in which to pursue them.  It is not a proper avenue
    to argue such matters to the jury.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    Lang J.A. said speaking for this court in <i>R. v. Trakas</i>, 2008 ONCA
    410 at para.&nbsp;32, defence counsel has no right to mount a personal attack
    on the integrity of Crown counsel before the jury:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>However,
      while the defence was entitled to comment on the Crown’s tactics on these
      issues, it was not entitled to suggest that the Crown attorneys personally
      showed a lack of integrity in arriving at that strategy. This is so for
      a number of reasons, most importantly because the trial was not about the
      personal integrity of the Crown attorneys, who would not be in a position
      in any event to respond to such allegations. To the contrary, the jury’s
      mandate was to decide whether the Crown had established its case against
      the respondent and not to weigh and compare the integrity of the Crown
      and the defence. If the defence wanted to challenge the Crown’s integrity,
      it could have sought an abuse of process ruling. It did not. See <i>Cook</i>,
      para. 58. <i>Accordingly, the question is whether the defence attacks on
      the “prosecution” in this case amounted to an attack on the Crown’s strategy
      and tactics or whether they amounted to an attack on the personal integrity
      of the Crown attorneys. The former is permissible; the latter is not.</i>  [Emphasis
      added.]</span></p>

line-height:normal'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Trakas</i>,
    Crown counsel sought a mistrial by reason of the defence jury address.  After
    lengthy submissions, the trial judge ruled against the mistrial but then
    cautioned the jury about defence counsel’s comments.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, Crown counsel objected to these comments, as he did to the other
    matters raised by the appellant.  The trial judge did not give any ruling
    on Crown counsel’s objections to the jury address.  On the other hand, it
    is not entirely clear what Crown counsel wanted the trial judge to do about
    the impugned comments.  He did not ask for a mistrial; it may be that he
    was seeking some kind of corrective instruction.  However, no instruction
    was given and Crown counsel did not raise any of these matters in his objections
    to the charge.  I am not persuaded that the impugned comments so undermined
    the role of Crown counsel that the prosecution did not receive a fair trial.  While
    excessive, the rhetoric was part of a reasonable argument that the prosecution
    case stood or fell on the evidence of the McPhails who, in the defence’s
    submission, should not be believed.</p>

    cross-examining Matthew, defence counsel was able to get him to concede that
    after the preliminary inquiry he spoke to his father and realized that he
    had erred in his description of his father’s ring.  Defence counsel attempted
    to place a particularly sinister spin on this evidence by suggesting that
    the witnesses were warned by the judge at the conclusion of the preliminary
    inquiry not to speak to each other about the case before trial.  Before the
    jury addresses, the trial judge raised the issue with counsel and told him
    that he could not find that any such warning had been given and that he intended
    to tell the jury that there is no evidence Matthew was given any warning.  Defence
    counsel agreed that this was fair.</p>

    made the suggestion in cross-examination in the first place and then to suggest
    in his jury address that Thomas and Matthew should face charges of “obstruction
    and contempt of court”.  Counsel for the appellant submits that the jury
    would naturally understand that this reference to obstruction and contempt
    of court relates to the warning incident.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    not to discuss his evidence, would then in effect go on to allege Matthew
    was in contempt of court.  On the other hand, the trial judge did expressly
    deal with the preliminary inquiry issue.  He told the jury that there was

    submission by the appellant raises a matter of some difficulty.  It seems
    to have become commonplace for defence counsel to refer in one way or another
    to the growing number of demonstrated wrongful convictions.  Indeed, the
    Supreme Court of Canada has recognized the spectre of wrongful convictions,
    most recently in <i>R. v. Trochym</i> (2007), 216 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (S.C.C.),
    where Deschamps J. began her reasons with the following statement:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>In
      recent years, a number of public inquiries have highlighted the importance
      of safeguarding the criminal justice system </span> – <span lang=EN> and
      protecting the accused who are tried under it </span> – <span lang=EN> from
      the possibility of <a name="ORIGHIT_4"></a><a name="HIT_4"></a>wrongful
      conviction. As this Court has previously noted, “[t]he names of

    Marshall, Milgaard, Morin, Sophonow and Parsons signal prudence and caution

    SCC 7, at para. 1. In the case at bar, we consider once again the need to
    carefully scrutinize evidence presented against an accused for reliability
    and prejudicial effect, and to ensure the basic fairness of the criminal
    process.</span></p>

line-height:normal'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    it is now a standard part of the jury instructions relating to identification
    evidence to expressly draw to the jury’s attention that there have been past
    miscarriages of justice and wrongful convictions because of mistakes by eyewitnesses.  On
    the other hand, reference in a jury address to a parade of wrongful convictions
    outside a relevant context, such as the established phenomenon of eyewitness
    identification, risks inviting the jury to take into account irrelevant considerations
    and imaginary dangers: see <i>R. v. Trakas</i> at paras. 22-23.  The invitation
    to avoid convicting so as not to add to the list of the wrongfully convicted
    is a form of intimidation that can be compared to the “timid juror” instruction<a

      v. Karthiresu</i> (2000), 129 O.A.C. 291 at paras. 8-9 this court noted
      the danger in a trial judge giving the timid juror direction as part of
      the definition of reasonable doubt because of the implication that jurors
      who acquit are timid and avoiding their responsibilities.  Similarly, reference
      to a parade of wrongful convictions risks inviting jurors not to convict
      despite the absence of reasonable doubt because of the possibility, which
      is not based on anything in the evidence in the particular case, that this
      accused might later be found to be innocent. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    seems to me that the following guidelines might assist when defence counsel
    wishes to raise the impact of wrongful convictions.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>1.         A
    passing reference to the potential of wrongful conviction in any criminal
    case is not beyond the bounds of legitimate argument.  For example, reminding
    the jury that they stand between the accused and the state to prevent the
    conviction of an innocent accused or that their responsibility is to protect
    persons from the possibility of a wrongful conviction is well within the
    bounds of legitimate argument.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>2.         Ordinarily,
    a reference to the history in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    of demonstrated wrongful convictions will not assist the jury in their task.  The
    jury is to reach its verdict on the evidence adduced in the case before them.  In
    particular, defence counsel should not overstate the problem of wrongful
    convictions.  For example, there is nothing in our legal history to support
    the suggestion that there has been a “parade” of wrongful convictions as
    a result of complaints by drug users, which essentially was the submission
    made by defence counsel in this case.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>3.         Counsel
    ought not to refer to specific cases such as the wrongful convictions of
    Guy Paul Morin or Thomas Sophonow or attempt to draw parallels with those
    cases.  The circumstances that led to the miscarriages of justice in those
    cases were complex and multifaceted.  Those circumstances will almost inevitably
    be quite different from the circumstances of the case the jury must deal
    with.  For example, the wrongful convictions in Morin and Sophonow were the
    result, in part, of a particular type of unreliable witness, jailhouse informants.  To
    refer to specific cases by name simply risks introducing irrelevant considerations
    and may draw counsel into giving evidence.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>4.         In
    eyewitness identification cases it is not improper for defence counsel to
    refer to the fact that there have been wrongful convictions because of mistaken
    eyewitness evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, while defence counsel should not have made the improper and excessive
    comments, and especially not referred to a parade of wrongful convictions,
    I am not convinced that this comment rendered the trial unfair.  I have not
    been persuaded that the impugned comments so distorted the trial as to render
    the verdict unsafe.</p>

    a Crown appeal from acquittal the appellant must satisfy this court that
    the verdict would not necessarily have been the same if the jury had been
    properly instructed or the excluded evidence admitted.  In <i>R. v. Morin</i> (1988),
    44 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.) at 221,   Sopinka J. described the onus on the
    Crown as “a heavy one”.  He continued that the accused should not be deprived
    of an acquittal and sent back for another trial unless the error “was such
    that there is a reasonable degree of certainty that the outcome may well
    have been affected by it”.</p>

line-height:normal'>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application of that test in this case is difficult.  In my view, the only
    error of substance in this case concerns the exclusion of a portion of Dr.
    Reid’s evidence.  The principal effect of the trial judge’s ruling was to
    deprive the jury of a potential explanation for why the collapsed lung was
    not seen on the first set of x-rays.  However, that evidence would not have
    established that Thomas did in fact have a collapsed lung that went undetected;
    it merely offered a possible explanation.  The jury also had Thomas’s uncontradicted
    evidence that he was not in another altercation before the second set of
    x-rays.  Finally, the jury had Dr. Reid’s evidence of the injuries she observed
    the early morning of August 1, and photographs and a videotape that were
    taken on August 2, by the police and that clearly depict Thomas’s numerous
    injuries.  Since the jury was not prepared to convict the respondent in the
    face of this evidence I am not satisfied to the required degree of certainty
    that had Dr. Reid’s additional evidence been admitted the verdict would have
    been different.  </p>
