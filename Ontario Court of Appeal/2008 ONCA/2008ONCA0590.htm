  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      This
    appeal under the <i>Provincial Offences Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.33, raises
    a question of appellate procedure under that <i>Act</i>.  The appellant Modern
    Niagara Toronto Inc. was acquitted by Quon J.P. on four charges contrary
    to the <i>Occupational Health and Safety Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. O.1.  The
    justice of the peace found that the <i>actus
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    reus</i> of two of the offences was not made out.  He found that the appellant
    had made out the due diligence or reasonable mistake of fact defence to the
    other two offences.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    Crown successfully appealed to the Provincial Offences Appeal Court.  Lane&nbsp;J.
    found the appellant guilty on three of the counts and imposed a fine of $135,000.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  On that appeal, the Crown was permitted to rely
    on a new theory of liability to overturn the acquittals.  In addition, the
    appeal judge stated that she was raising two new issues that were dispositive
    of the appeal in favour of the Crown.  The appellant first learned of these
    new issues when the appeal judge released her reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      In
    granting special leave to appeal to this court, MacPherson J.A. stated:  “There
    is a fundamental issue of fairness raised by the way in which the appeal
    judge heard and determined the appeal.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      In
    our view, the appellant was denied a fair hearing of its appeal in the Provincial
    Offences Appeal Court.  While the appellant raises other issues, the fair
    hearing issues are sufficient to dispose of the matter.  We would allow the
    appeal and remit the matter to the Provincial Offences Appeal Court for a
    new hearing before a different judge.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE
      FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      In
    light of our disposition of the case, we only outline so much of the facts
    as are necessary to understand the issues upon which disposition of the appeal
    turns.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    appellant is a mechanical contractor that installs heating and cooling systems
    in commercial buildings.  In October 2000, the appellant was engaged to install
    a supplementary cooling system at First Canadian Place in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto.  Prior to completing the installation, the new system was pressurized
    with nitrogen gas to test for leaks.  Martin Maurer, an experienced journeyman
    steamfitter, applied the pressure test.  As part of the test procedure, all
    of the valves within the system were opened so that the complete system could
    be tested.  Ordinarily, the pressure test is kept on for at least twenty-four
    hours.  When the test equipment is installed on the system, it is highly
    visible, and it was the defence evidence that the standard in the industry
    at the time was that this was sufficient to warn anyone working on the system.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      In
    this case, the test was left on for about two weeks because Maurer was called
    away to another job in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Mississauga.  About a week and a half after the test was applied, Maurer
    and Francesco Conti (the injured worker), an experienced journeyman welder,
    attended at the work site to install an additional bypass to the heat exchanger.  Because
    the test equipment was interfering with the new installation, Maurer allowed
    Conti to disconnect it.  At the end of the day, the test equipment was not
    reinstalled.  Thus, there was no visible sign that the new installation was
    under pressure.  Maurer and Conti were to return within a few days to complete
    the bypass installation.  The evidence seems relatively clear that Maurer
    did not expect anyone else to be working on the site in the meantime.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      However,
    two days later, David Johnstone, the appellant’s project manager, attended
    at the work site in response to a call from the building’s maintenance staff
    about water leakage.  Johnstone and another employee made a temporary repair
    to stop the leak.  In the course of doing so, they closed some of the valves
    of the new supplementary cooling system.  Since the test equipment was not
    in place, Johnstone assumed that the pressure test had been completed and
    that the system was no longer under pressure.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    following morning Maurer and Michael Rollo, an experienced journeyman plumber,
    attended at the work site to complete the installation of both the supplementary
    cooling system and the bypass.  Conti was to arrive later to do the necessary
    welding.  Johnstone was not on the site, but he spoke to Rollo on the telephone
    and told him about the leak and the work he had done to deal with it, including
    closing some valves.  The evidence is conflicting as to whether Rollo passed
    on to Maurer that Johnstone had closed some valves.  At some point, Rollo
    found some trapped gas in the supplementary cooling system and released it.  Maurer
    heard the release of gas and it was his evidence that he assumed that all
    of the gas had been drained from the system, even though it was his responsibility
    to remove the gas.  In fact, because Johnstone had closed some of the valves,
    gas was still trapped in part of the system.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    Conti arrived, he and Maurer began to remove a cap from the supplementary
    cooling system.  As they did so, the cap blew off and seriously injured Conti.  The
    cap blew off because gas was still trapped in the part of the system they
    were working on.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE

line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    a result of the accident, the appellant was charged with four offences contrary
    to the <i>Occupational Health and Safety Act </i>as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>1.         Failing
    to provide information, instruction and supervision to a worker contrary
    to s. 25(2)(a) by not informing the worker that there was pressurized gas
    in the pipe;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>2.         Failing
    to acquaint a worker with a hazard contrary to s. 25(2)(d) by failing to
    acquaint the worker with the hazard of pressurized gas in the pipe;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>3.         Failing
    to ensure that the measures and procedures prescribed by s. 48(1)(a) of the
    Ontario Regulation 213/91 were carried out contrary to s. 25(1)(c) by not
    releasing the pressure in the pipe; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>4.         Failing
    to take every precaution reasonable in the circumstances for the protection
    of a worker contrary to s. 25(2)(h) by failing to have a procedure in place
    to ensure that all pipes were depressurized before work was performed on
    them.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE
      DECISION OF THE JUSTICE OF THE PEACE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    justice of the peace found that while the <i>actus reus </i>of count #1 was
    made out, the appellant had established the defence of due diligence.  He
    held that the procedure for testing leaks is routinely performed; the workers
    on the project were all experienced and knew the procedure well.  They had
    been trained in the procedure as part of their apprenticeship and did not
    need to be expressly trained on it by the employer.  The procedure used by
    the appellant was standard in the industry and was adequate to prevent the
    occurrence.  The accident occurred because of Maurer’s error in judgment
    when he deviated from standard operating procedure by removing the test equipment
    without depressurizing the system.  He also held that the accident was not
    reasonably foreseeable.  The justice of the peace found that the appellant
    was entitled to rely on the training its experienced journeyman steamfitters
    and plumbers had received and that it was operating in accordance with the
    industry standard.  The appellant had therefore taken all reasonable precautions
    in the circumstances to avoid the prohibited act.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    justice of the peace also found that the reasonable mistake of fact defence
    was made out.  He held that it was reasonable in the circumstances for the
    appellant, through the project manager Johnstone, to mistakenly believe that
    the system had been depressurized.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    justice of the peace found that the <i>actus
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    reus</i> of count #2 had not been made out.  The evidence established that
    Conti was well aware of the hazard of pressurized gas in the pipe.  In particular,
    he was with Maurer when the test apparatus had been removed and the pipe
    not depressurized.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    to count #3, the justice of the peace found that the <i>actus
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    reus</i> was established but that due diligence and reasonable mistake of
    fact were made out, for much the same reasons as dealt with under count #1.</p>

line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    as to count #4, the justice of the peace found that there was a safe procedure
    in place to depressurize pipes before work was performed on them and thus
    the Crown had not established the <i>actus reus</i> of the offence.  This
    unwritten procedure was standard in the industry, well known and a basic
    skill used by the appellant’s workers.  The procedure was routinely followed
    by the workers and was adequate to prevent any harm.  The method used is
    part of the fundamental knowledge of experienced journeyman workers.  The
    employer is “not automatically required to train or instruct its experienced
    employees in a procedure already well known by them”, unless the procedure
    is clearly inadequate or inherently unsafe.  Since the procedure in place
    was safe and adequate to protect the workers, no special training or instruction
    was required.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE
      DECISION OF THE APPEAL JUDGE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal judge listed a number of issues on the appeal, including whether an
    employer can establish due diligence by relying on work experience and apprenticeship
    training alone, whether Maurer was a supervisor so that his acts can be attributed
    to the appellant and whether the mistake of fact defence could be made out
    solely on the basis of Johnstone’s knowledge.  The appeal judge then wrote
    as follows at para. 18:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I would add
    two additional issues not argued on the appeal.  1) Whether there was a “procedure
    in place” for depressurizing pipes that met the objectives of the OHSA?  2)
    Whether there was any action or neglect by Johnstone that must be attributed
    to Modern Niagara?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal judge conducted an extensive review of the evidence.  She held that
    the justice of the peace misapplied the law and made palpable and overriding
    errors of fact.  Accordingly, she made her own findings of fact based on
    her review of the evidence and concluded that the <i>actus reus</i> was made
    out on counts #1, 3 and 4 and that the due diligence and reasonable mistake
    of fact defences failed in relation to them.  The acquittal on count #2 was
    not appealed. </p>

    appellant submits that the appeal judge erred in permitting the Crown to
    argue for the first time on appeal that the appellant was liable for Maurer’s
    acts pursuant to s.&nbsp;66(4) of the <i>Occupational Health and Safety Act</i>.  That
    section provides that “any act or neglect on the part of any manager, agent,
    representative, officer, director or supervisor of the accused … shall be
    the act or neglect of the accused”.  This issue was not raised in the Crown’s
    opening at trial.  To the contrary, in his submissions Crown counsel’s only
    reference to “the defendant’s supervisor”
    was obviously to Johnstone.  The other persons involved were referred to
    as the “three workers”.  Crown counsel also did not suggest that Maurer was
    a supervisor in his closing submissions.  Crown counsel raised the issue
    of the company being liable because Maurer was a supervisor for the first
    time in his closing reply submissions and only in passing and without reference
    to s.&nbsp;66(4).  </p>

    issue of Maurer as a supervisor was barely touched on in his testimony.  Maurer
    testified that he was a foreman for the company.  Crown counsel asked him
    to describe what a foreman is.  Maurer testified that he supervised other
    workers and that the number of men he supervised depended on the size of
    the job, but usually it was two of them.  Crown counsel then asked Maurer
    if he was able to discipline workers.  He said he could not and was even
    unclear who did have responsibility, although he guessed that Johnstone did
    have power to discipline.  After that exchange, Crown counsel did not return
    to the question of Maurer’s responsibilities as a supervisor.  In cross-examination,
    Maurer testified that Johnstone gave him overall responsibility for the project
    to make sure the work was done and he could give instructions to the other

    issue of Maurer as supervisor under the <i>Act</i> was also not raised with
    Johnstone, the project manager. Finally, Robert Silberstein, the appellant’s
    president, testified in chief that a foreman was empowered to discipline
    a member of his workforce if he identified any safety problems.  In cross-examination,
    Crown counsel confirmed this aspect of Silberstein’s testimony but otherwise
    did not touch on the question of Maurer as a supervisor within the meaning
    of the <i>Act</i>.</p>

    justice of the peace did not deal with the issue of the appellant’s liability
    on the basis that Maurer was a supervisor.  This is not surprising given
    the oblique way in which the issue was raised by Crown counsel for the first
    time in his reply submissions.  The issue was not raised in the Crown’s notice
    of appeal to the Provincial Offences Appeal Court.  The first real notice
    that the appellant had of its potential liability under s.&nbsp;66(4) for
    Maurer’s acts came in the Crown’s factum to the appeal court.  The appeal
    judge nevertheless allowed the Crown to raise the issue and she held at para.
    45 of her reasons that “[t]he acts or neglects on Maurer’s part, under s.
    66(4) of the OHSA, must be attributed to the respondent.”</p>

    our view, the Crown should not have been permitted to rely upon s. 66(4)
    in relation to Maurer.  In <i>R. v. Elms</i> (2006), 217 C.C.C. (3d) 217
    (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region

    ), the accused had been acquitted of fifteen counts of wilful promotion of
    hatred.  On a Crown appeal, the summary conviction appeal court overturned
    the acquittal on the basis of a theory of liability that had not been advanced
    at trial.  On further appeal, this court restored the acquittal because it
    was not open to the Crown to advance a new theory of liability for the first
    time on appeal.  Juriansz J.A. writing for the court, held as follows at
    para. 29:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>In
      my view, it would offend the rule against double jeopardy to dismiss the
      appeal based on a new theory that the charges relate to the contents of
      the covers and not the CDs and lyric sheets. The comments of Doherty J.A.
      in <i>R. v. Varga</i> (1994), 90 C.C.C. (3d) 484 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">

  <p class=Doubleindent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN>A Crown appeal cannot be the means whereby the Crown puts forward a different
      case than the one it chose to advance at trial. It offends double jeopardy
      principles, even as modified by the Crown’s right of appeal, to subject

      raised by the Crown for the first time on appeal.</span></p>

    our view, these comments apply to this case.  It was unfair to permit the
    Crown to rely upon Maurer as a supervisor for the first time on appeal, when
    the appellant had no notice this was an issue at trial, the matter was not
    canvassed in the evidence and raised only obliquely in reply argument.  A
    Crown appeal is not the time for the prosecution to advance a new theory
    of liability: see also <i>R. v. Wexler </i>(1939), 72 C.C.C. 1 (S.C.C.).  The
    appeal judge held that her findings that Maurer and Johnstone were supervisors “are
    conclusive of this appeal”.  She held that in the result the due diligence
    defence was not available and the appellant was to be convicted on counts
    #1 and 3.</p>

    first was whether there was a “procedure” in place that “met the objectives
    of the OHSA”.  The appellant submits that this was a new issue and it was
    not given an opportunity to respond to it.  We do not agree, and would not
    have allowed the appeal if this were the only issue.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is not entirely clear why the appeal judge characterized this as a new issue.  The
    question of whether there was a procedure in place was central to the question
    of the <i>actus
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    reus </i>in count #4.  Count #4 charged that the appellant failed as an employer
    to take every precaution reasonable in the circumstances for the protection
    of a worker.  The lack of precaution was particularized as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The accused
    had failed to take the precaution of having a procedure in place to ensure
    that all pipes were depressurized before work was performed on them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    justice of the peace dealt with this issue at length.  He found that “there
    was a safe procedure in place to depressurize pipes before work was to be
    performed on them, although it had not been in written form”.  He also held
    that the procedure was
    “routinely followed by [Modern Niagara’s workers] and was adequate in preventing
    any harm to its workers”.  The appeal judge held at para. 56 that this was “a
    palpable and overriding error in fact and law”.  In her view, the appellant
    had no procedure in place that was safe and adequate and thus, “By definition,
    such a procedure amounted to none [at] all.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    question of whether the <i>actus
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    reus</i> was made out was also raised in the Crown’s notice of appeal in
    the Provincial Offences Appeal Court.  As we understand it, the appellant
    argues that the new issue was the appeal judge’s view that any procedure
    had to comply with the objectives of the <i>Act</i>.  However, we agree with
    the Crown that if the procedure was not safe and adequate it could not be
    said that the employer had complied with its duty to take every reasonable
    precaution as required by s. 25(2)(h) of the <i>Act</i>.  </p>

    we have said, this was not a new issue raised for the first time on appeal;
    the justice of the peace himself dealt with the question at length.  It will
    be for the judge hearing the appeal to determine whether the justice of the
    peace erred in holding that there was a safe procedure in place.</p>

    allowing the Crown appeal, the appeal judge also relied upon her finding
    that Johnstone was a supervisor.  This issue was not argued at trial or on
    the appeal.  The appellant first learned that this was an issue in the case
    when the appeal judge’s reasons for judgment were released.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    and of itself, the issue of Johnstone as a supervisor was not a new issue,
    as the undisputed evidence clearly established that Johnstone was a supervisor.  The
    issue is therefore different from the question of Maurer as a supervisor.  The
    problem is that because the issue was not argued on the appeal, the appellant
    had no opportunity to make submissions as to the consequence of a finding
    that Johnstone was a supervisor.  One example will suffice to illustrate
    the unfairness.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    justice of the peace found that on the morning of the accident, Johnstone
    gave instructions to Maurer, through his conversation with Rollo, to check
    everything out, including the valves in the supplementary cooling system.  The
    justice of the peace relied partly on this finding to hold that the company
    had exercised due diligence.  The appeal judge held that the justice of the
    peace had misinterpreted the evidence.  She made her own finding of fact
    that Johnstone’s order did not relate to pressure in the system but to the
    problem of the water leak that Johnstone had dealt with the day before.  In
    our view, it is arguable that the appeal judge misinterpreted the evidence
    and that the justice of the peace had correctly interpreted the evidence.  Unfortunately,
    because the appeal judge raised the issue on her own she did not have the
    benefit of submissions on the issue.  The failure to provide the appellant
    with the opportunity to make submissions on this issue deprived it of a fair
    hearing at the appeal.</p>

    respondent argues that even if there were procedural errors in the conduct
    of the appeal hearing, the appeal should be dismissed, because those errors
    did not taint the other findings of the appeal judge which were an adequate
    basis for entering convictions.  In particular, after making the findings
    concerning Johnstone and Maurer as supervisors and the issue of a procedure
    in place, the appeal judge went on to consider the justice of the peace’s
    analysis of the due diligence defence, an issue that was central to the trial
    and the appeal.  </p>

line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, this submission cannot succeed because the errors by the appeal
    judge with respect to the new theory of liability infected her assessment
    of the due diligence defence.  For example at paras. 88-89, she appears to
    analyze the defence of due diligence on the assumption that Maurer was a
    supervisor.  In this regard, she held that the decision in <i>R. v. London
    Excavators &amp; Trucking Ltd.</i> (1998), 125 C.C.C. (3d) 83 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    ) was directly applicable and “reinforces my previous finding that Maurer
    was a
    ‘supervisor’ within the meaning of the OHSA”.  We are not convinced that
    an appeal court would necessarily have reached the same conclusions on liability
    in the absence of the errors discussed above.</p>
