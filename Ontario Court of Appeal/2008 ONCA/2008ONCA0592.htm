      Sarkis Keuroghlian (“Sarkis”) was a foreign exchange trader with Refco
      Futures (
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    ) Ltd. (“Refco”). Between 1997 and 2000, Sarkis executed multiple foreign
    exchange trades on behalf of certain clients, but never received funds from
    the clients to pay for the trades or to cover the approximately $5.4 million
    in losses suffered by Refco on the trades.</span></p>

      alleged that Sarkis manipulated Refco’s internal controls to ensure that
      Refco would not know that client funds to pay for the trades were not forthcoming,
      and that Refco’s own funds were being used to cover the losses. Sarkis
      testified that Refco management was aware of the disputed trades, but chose
      to allow the trades to continue. The central issue at trial was whether
      Refco knew the trades were unfunded and whether Refco authorized the disputed
      trades. The trial judge disbelieved Sarkis and found him liable for damages
      for fraud and for breach of contract. He dismissed Sarkis’ counterclaim
      for wrongful dismissal.</span></p>

      terms of the addendum were: (i) Sarkis was responsible for ensuring that
      the forex group operated according to Refco’s policies; (ii) Sarkis was
      responsible for customer debits (<i>i.e</i>., he was responsible to cover

      knowledge in operating its forex department. For example, contrary to the
      recommendations in Refco’s Forex Trading Manual (“Manual”) to prepare segregated
      client account statements, Refco relied on Sarkis’ personal record of all
      his trades as the principal repository of information related to forex
      trading. The respondent claimed that Refco’s management permitted the use
      of this system because they had the utmost confidence and trust in Sarkis
      in relation to foreign exchange matters. </span></p>

      1997, in response to a recommendation by Refco’s auditor, Arthur Andersen,
      Chee drafted the Manual to establish policies for forex trading. Sarkis
      and Gloutney provided input into its terms. The basic terms of the Manual
      were: (i) a forex account was required for a client to engage in forex
      trading; (ii) clients who wanted to do forward forex trades were generally
      required to post a 5% margin before the forex order would be accepted;
      (iii) account executives were responsible for reviewing client accounts
      and making margin calls; and (iv) if client debits were not collected the
      account executive was responsible. The Manual also recommended that Refco
      discontinue its existing practice whereby all forex trades were conducted
      through one “house account”. Making this change would ensure that individual
      client’s debits could be tracked. Chee was responsible for ensuring compliance
      with the Manual. </span></p>

      the Manual was approved by Arthur Andersen, many of the procedures prescribed
      in it were not implemented or adhered to. No system of tracking individual
      accounts was ever implemented, and certain “known clients” were allowed
      to trade without posting margin. Sarkis claimed that he refused to sign
      an acknowledgement of his agreement with the Manual’s terms because of
      the divergence between Refco’s actual practice and the policies set out
      in the Manual.</span></p>

      practice, and in contrast with the procedures prescribed in the Manual
      requiring segregated client account statements, Sarkis and the few other
      forex traders at Refco would each provide the back office employees with
      a daily handwritten list of credits and debits identifying the amounts
      of money that were expected to be transferred into and out of the house
      account. This information would then be used to compile a daily cash balancing

      basis against the transactions appearing on Refco’s bank statement from
      its accounts with the Royal Bank of Canada (“RBC”). Credits and debits
      that appeared on the CEAL but not on the bank statements were labelled

      No margin was provided for these trades and no funds were provided to pay
      for the settlements. These trades were all put through on the account of
      Al-Mustashar, Sarkis’ holding company. All of the trades were recorded
      on documentation provided to the back office which variously identified
      the client as either Al-Mustashar, Al-Mustashar/Berbari, or as Berbari.  Sami
      Berbari was a Refco client known to Sarkis. </span></p>

      no problem. On February 16, 2000, Chee realized there could be a problem
      with the house account balance and approached Gloutney, who asked Sarkis
      to explain the trades. Sarkis stated that the trades were made on behalf
      of Berbari. Sarkis also stated that he would get the money from Berbari.  He
      later told Gloutney that he would be physically harmed if he travelled
      to see Berbari to try to get the money he owed.  Chee was told to investigate
      the issue. After investigating the issue over the weekend, Chee identified
      the credits that Sarkis had told the back office to enter but that had
      been subsequently reversed when the money did not come in. On February
      24, 2000, Refco officially terminated Sarkis’ employment.</span></p>

      February 22, 2000, Refco transferred the two open positions to the account
      of Wells Ltd. at Refco Bermuda.  On February 23, 2000, $6.5 million Cdn.
      was transferred to Refco’s account at RBC and the next day, that amount
      was credited to the house account.  Of this amount, $5.4 million was treated
      as a subordinated loan from Refco Global Holdings to Refco. On February
      23, 2000, an agreement pertaining to this indebtedness was entered into
      between Refco and Refco Global Holdings. The Montreal Exchange was a party
      to this agreement. When Man Financial Canada acquired Refco, the subordinated
      debt was converted into 5.4 million senior Canadian preferred shares worth
      $1 each with attached retraction rights that allow the holder, Refco’s
      new parent company, to require Refco to redeem the shares and pay the $5.4
      million plus any accrued dividends.</span></p>

      trial judge set out the balance of his findings in the last four pages
      of the reasons. His credibility findings are contained in paras. 316-22
      and 330:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>In
      my view, the evidence of the witnesses called on behalf of the plaintiff
      and in particular the evidence of Ms. Chee and Mr. Gloutney was far more
      believable than the evidence of Sarkis himself who was the only witness
      called on his behalf other than, of course, his wife. Sarkis’
    wife’s evidence only related to – what I will call – the after the fact effect
    of Sarkis’ conduct on himself and his family.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>Sarkis’ evidence
      in this case was that the plaintiff at all times knew exactly what he was
      doing during the period, starting sometime in 1997 to February 2000, which
      resulted in such losses. </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>It
      is also a fact that Sarkis was paid commission of approximately $ 350,000.00
      on the trades that lost money for Refco.&nbsp; </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>I
      find it unbelievable that Refco management would allow on a regular basis
      and for many months the types of trading Sarkis was in engaged in, which
      had the effect of increasing the debit loss and the effect of paying substantial
      commissions to Sarkis. </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>I
      further find that Sarkis deliberately hid from Refco management the true
      picture of what was happening in the Sarkis/Al-Mustashar accounts. The
      continually used Sarkis system of credits and debits was a device analogous
      to a smoke screen that I find was created and used to deceive Refco management
      from the true state of affairs. Refco was entitled to rely on Sarkis’ representations
      and did. Such conduct is clearly fraudulent and I so find it to be. </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>In
      addition to finding Sarkis liable in fraud to the plaintiff I find him
      liable in contract as well. Without repeating evidence I find that the
      terms of Sarkis’ employment were such that he was responsible for losses
      incurred not only by himself, but also by his clients. Clearly, Sarkis
      had some interest in Al-Mustashar and I am somewhat convinced that he was
      trading on behalf of foreign nationals and/or people out of Canada who
      had not put up the usual deposits the purpose of which is to protect management. </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>In
      my view, the evidence clearly is conclusive that a trader was responsible
      for bad debts.  The management and Sarkis’ colleagues clearly supported
      the conception of the trader being responsible for unpaid losses.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>                                            …</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>The
      consequences of Sarkis’ conduct have clearly been disastrous.  Sarkis at
      the time of his dismissal was 54 years old and had been with Refco for
      approximately 12 years.  Even though Sarkis has done his best to convince
      me he was really a trader with a fancy title I am of the opinion that he
      was a senior manager with great responsibilities.</span></p>

      appellant complains that these reasons for judgment, although lengthy,
      are not adequate for appellate review, that the findings portion of the
      reasons is brief and conclusory and does not explain the trial judge’s
      reasons for his findings, that the first 315 paragraphs are taken “virtually
      verbatim” from the written submissions of counsel and “involve a mechanistic
      review of the evidence”, and that the credibility findings are insufficient
      because they do not address and resolve the discrepancies in the evidence,
      particularly among Chee, Gloutney and Sarkis. </span></p>

      do not agree. The trial judge heard the evidence of all the witnesses and
      also had the benefit of the parties’ detailed written argument, including
      a review from each side that highlighted the alleged discrepancies in the
      evidence, as well as improbabilities, co-incidences and other features
      that go into an assessment of credibility. He chose to structure his reasons
      by topic, synthesizing the complex evidence on each topic, and where required,
      stating which evidence he preferred. </span></p>

      trial judge did make use of the written argument of counsel, as he was
      entitled to do. He included some verbatim sections, particularly in his
      description of the intricacies of forex trading. The balance of the reasons
      leading up to his findings section draws on the written argument as well

      findings at the end of the trial judge’s reasons are fully comprehensible
      in the context of the preceding portion of his reasons setting out the
      evidence related to the issues before the court.  Interspersed in the trial
      judge’s summary of the evidence are factual findings that explain his ultimate
      findings. For example, the parties disputed whether Sarkis was always merely
      a forex trader, or whether he assumed the more responsible position of
      Forex Manager in 1991. Refco’s position was that in 1991, when Sarkis signed
      the employment agreement addendum and took on the title of Forex Manager,
      Sarkis was given oversight of and management responsibility for the forex
      department. In contrast, Sarkis claimed that this title was “meaningless” and
      that, even after 1991, he was just another trader with a fancy title.  </span></p>

      the evidentiary portion of the trial judge’s reasons under the heading “Sarkis’ Employment
      Responsibilities”, which sets out part of the evidentiary basis for his
      findings on the breach of contract cause of action, the trial judge found
      at para. 84: “the weight of the evidence is that Sarkis was given the title
      of Forex Manager in 1991, pursuant to the addendum to his original employment
      contract. However, more important to this litigation is the duties and
      responsibilities that came with the title.”  The trial judge then described
      the different witnesses’ views on that issue, highlighting the increased
      responsibilities and benefits that Sarkis had compared to other forex traders
      and also the relevant duties and responsibilities that Gloutney and Chee
      had in relation to those of Sarkis. </span></p>

      trial judge concluded that Sarkis’ claim that he was not acting in a managerial
      capacity was undermined by the significant duties and responsibilities
      that were given to him by management, as well as by his guaranteed salary
      of $5000 per month plus commission, in contrast with the other Refco brokers
      who did not earn such a salary (Reasons, paras. 85 and 330).</span></p>

      example of how the trial judge’s lengthy review of the evidence makes comprehensible
      his ultimate findings relates to the heavily contested issue of whether
      senior management knew the details of Sarkis’ disputed forex trading and
      acquiesced in his conduct.  Sarkis claimed that Refco was aware of all
      his transactions even though there was no individual tracking of client
      accounts. He contended that Gloutney, Chee and the back office all knew
      what he was doing, since he reported all of his transactions, but they
      did not care about it until the weekend before he was dismissed.  Sarkis
      relied on Chee’s responsibility for financial compliance at Refco, as well
      as the fact that Chee failed to implement the policies in the Manual, to
      argue that Chee and Refco failed to institute procedures to protect against
      the problems that emerged, and that Chee and Gloutney abdicated their responsibilities
      for monitoring forex trading and instead improperly relied on Sarkis to
      ensure compliance. Finally, Sarkis submitted that Gloutney and Chee failed
      to take basic investigatory steps when confronted with the problem.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      respondent’s position was that Sarkis’ disputed credit entries were fictitious
      credits amounting to written misrepresentations, which he used to maintain
      a positive balance in the CEAL. The respondent claimed that when the credits
      did not come in, the back office would reconcile them, at which point Sarkis
      would make more fictitious credits to cover his tracks, and that Chee was
      not aware of this practice because of the volume of money and trades going
      through the account and the CEAL. Chee testified that when she became concerned
      over the reconciling items in question, Sarkis’ assured her that the fictitious
      credits represented promised payments from Berbari or provided other oral
      misrepresentations. Given all the evidence, the respondent submitted that
      the only possible inference was that the purpose of the ever-changing,
      unidentified credits was to confuse the back office and hide the Al-Mustashar
      debit.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge accepted the respondent’s position that Refco management was
      not aware of the Al-Mustashar debts as a result of the fictitious credits
      used by Sarkis.  In this regard, he pointed to Chee’s evidence that she
      did not notice the funds being deducted from Refco’s accounts to cover
      the fictitious credits, and the trial judge observed at para. 168 that
      it was easy to see why these transactions went undetected:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>When one looks
    at the account statements, it is easy to see why [Chee did not notice the
    funds being deducted from the accounts].  There are millions of dollars moving
    in and out of these accounts.  Even the larger sums deducted from time to
    time by the Royal Bank are relatively small compared to the overall account,
    and given that RBC was the counterparty for Refco’s Forex trades, there appeared
    to be absolutely nothing unusual about them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Thus,
      although the trial judge did not attempt to directly reconcile every alleged
      discrepancy in the evidence, he fully discussed the details of the trades
      and what the Refco employees knew about them and he considered the explanations
      for why the trades did not set off alarm bells until February 2000. He
      also described instances where Sarkis contradicted his own testimony or
      acknowledged that he had changed his story. By preferring the evidence
      of the Refco witnesses over the evidence of Sarkis, the trial judge accepted
      their explanation that the debits went undetected as a result of both the
      trust and responsibility reposed in Sarkis in relation to forex trading
      at Refco and as a result of Sarkis’ oral and written misrepresentations.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Sarkis
      effectively acknowledged that what he was doing would have been a fraud
      on the company unless the company knew about it and acquiesced. The trial
      judge concluded that senior management did not appreciate what was going
      on and they certainly did not acquiesce. This conclusion was open to him
      and, indeed, was a very reasonable one on the evidence. The trades were
      done on the account of Sarkis’ personal holding company. There was no concrete
      evidence that the trades were ever done for  Berbari or any other client,
      since no client ever supplied any funds in relation to the disputed transactions.
      It was therefore fair for the trial judge to conclude that he was only “somewhat
      convinced” that the trades were for clients of Sarkis who failed to put
      up any money. Whether they were for Sarkis alone or for his friends, either
      way, Gloutney, Chee and Refco did not stand to profit from the trades in
      the same way that Sarkis did.  Besides earning $350,000 in commission on
      the trades, Sarkis was conducting the disputed trades with personal upside
      but no downside.  Although Refco earned commission as well, because the
      trades resulted in losses, that commission was merely an accounting entry.
      There was thus no logical basis to draw a conclusion that senior management
      acted as Sarkis’
    willing accomplices.  Moreover, they denied this suggestion in their testimony
    and the trial judge accepted their evidence, as was open to him to do.</span></p>

      trial judge recognized that credibility was the key issue before him. He
      focused on it by outlining the story in a logical way, then at the end
      making his finding that the respondent’s story was far more believable
      than the appellant’s. There are many ways to structure reasons for judgment.
      The task is more difficult in a complex case. In my view, the trial judge’s
      reasons were sufficient for the appellant to understand why he was found
      liable and to permit effective appellate review.</span></p>

      would add that the appellant’s theory of the case is not at all compelling.
      He did not suggest that the Refco management specifically told him it was
      fine if he continued to hide the debits that he was incurring. His theory
      at trial and on appeal is essentially that, because what he was doing was
      transparent, Refco management must have understood and either approved
      of, or at least acquiesced in, his conduct and therefore he was not committing
      a fraud on the company. The problem with this theory is that Sarkis was
      still effectively taking money from the company by gambling with its funds
      for his personal benefit. Without express authorization, the basis for
      which is not easily imagined, the appellant was committing a fraud on the
      company. Had the trial judge found senior management complicit in his conduct,
      they may well have shared the legal responsibility for the losses.</span></p>

      contrary to the submission of the appellant, the trial judge did not simply
      prefer the evidence of the respondent’s witnesses. He stated that the evidence
      of Chee and Gloutney was “far more believable” than the evidence of Sarkis.
      In the context of the two burdens of proof that the trial judge said he
      was applying, I understand this to be a reference to the higher standard:
      see <i>Stetler v. Ontario Flue-Cured Tobacco Growers’ Marketing Board </i>(2005),

      J. stated at p. 335 that “[c]arelessness on the part of the victim has
      never been a defence to an action for fraud.” She went on to say at p.

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Once the plaintiff
    knows of the fraud, he must mitigate his loss but, until he knows of it,

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>And, in my opinion,
    a good thing, too. There may be greater dangers to civilized society than
    endemic dishonesty. But I can think of nothing which will contribute to dishonesty
    more than a rule of law which requires us all to be on perpetual guard against
    rogues lest we be faced with a defence of “Ha, ha, your own fault, I fool

      appellant argues that this situation represents an exception because of
      the position of Chee and Gloutney as senior employees with knowledge and
      responsibilities for strict compliance with trading rules. These of course
      are duties they owe to their employer and to the public. They are not duties

      appellant also refers by analogy to the insurance context and this court’s
      decision in <i>Pereira v. Hamilton Township Farmers’ Mutual Fire Insurance
      Co. </i>(2006), 209 O.A.C. 127, where there is reference to an exception
      to the general rule that an insurer has no duty to investigate the representations
      made by an insured when applying for insurance. That exception may impose
      a duty to enquire where an insurer is effectively on notice that something
      the insured says is untrue.</span></p>

      without deciding whether such an analogy can be drawn in law, in this case,
      Chee did make inquiries of Sarkis about his debits and credits and he gave
      her explanations and assurances that she accepted.  It hardly lies in Sarkis’ mouth
      to say that she should not have believed him, and because she did, it was
      her fault that he defrauded their employer.</span></p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(4)   <i>Contractual

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

      appellant argues that the trial judge erred in holding that he was under
      a contractual obligation to bear the cost of unpaid client debits. He submits
      that the only written instruments that set out the terms of his employment
      were the 1988 initial engagement letter, the 1991 employment addendum and
      the Manual. The appellant observes that the 1988 letter does not make any
      reference to the issue of broker liability for client fees. Although the
      latter two documents do mention such liability, the 1991 addendum did not
      bind Sarkis, because it was reviewable after three months and the practices
      at Refco subsequently shifted such that they no longer reflected the terms
      of the addendum, and Sarkis did not sign the acknowledgement recognizing
      the terms of the Manual.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

      would reject this ground of appeal. The trial judge found that the terms
      of Sarkis’ employment made him responsible for losses incurred for his
      own account as well as for his clients. On the first issue, Sarkis was
      trading at least to some extent for himself because of his interest in
      Al-Mustashar, his holding company. The trial judge was only “somewhat convinced” that
      he was trading for foreign clients, because no client ever put up any funds.
      However, even if he was trading for clients, the trial judge accepted the
      evidence given by Refco management and traders that standard industry practice
      is such that traders are liable for unpaid client debts. The trial judge
      was entitled to accept this evidence and there is no basis to interfere
      with his findings.<i></i></span></p>

      appellant claims that Refco did not prove that it suffered any actual pecuniary
      loss because of the intercorporate steps it took to move the forex trade
      position to another company. The appellant says that Refco was paid more
      than the loss and did not prove that the payment or any part of it constituted
      an actual intercorporate loan liability for that transfer.</span></p>

      appellant also complains that the trial judge dismissed this argument in
      perfunctory reasons. The trial judge referred to the appellant’s submission
      on this issue at paras. 267-72 of his reasons and set out the respondent’s
      position at paras. 296-97.  At para. 324, he commented that the appellant’s
      submission was “very complicated and of no merit.”</span></p>

      appellant also asks this court to reassess the evidence regarding the transfer
      of the loss position to Wells Ltd. and the documentation supporting that
      transaction, including the subordinated loan agreement, to find that Refco
      did not use the best evidence to support its version of what occurred.</span></p>

      would dismiss this ground of appeal as well. The trial judge was entitled
      to accept the evidence given by and on behalf of Refco as to how it dealt
      with the loss once it was discovered. The series of transactions is complex.
      However, the trial judge evidently accepted the fact that Refco was left
      with a subordinated loan obligation reflecting the amount of the forex
      loss as calculated by the expert who testified regarding the quantum of
      the loss. The appellant did not call any expert to refute that calculation.
      He only argued that the amount of the loss was mitigated by its sale to
      Wells. The trial judge accepted that part of the sale involved incurring
      the loan obligation, so that the loss was not mitigated. He was entitled
      to do so.</span></p>

      response to the argument made on the appeal that Refco did not put forward
      the best evidence of full documentation to explain the sale and loan transactions
      and that an adverse inference should have been drawn, the respondent says
      that it called the best evidence that was available by the time of the
      trial. By that time, the Refco Group had fallen apart, its U.S. CEO had
      been arrested for fraud, and there were no further witnesses available
      to testify. </span></p>

      that deference is accorded to the trial judge on evidentiary issues, including
      the sufficiency of the evidence to prove an issue in the case. The trial
      judge was in the best position to assess the evidence, including whether
      he was satisfied that the best evidence had been called on the issue in
