    appellant appeals from his convictions and sentence arising from a jury trial
    presided over by Killeen J.  The appellant was convicted of one count of
    sexual assault with a weapon (a handgun), one count of aggravated sexual
    assault, two counts of overcoming resistance by choking, and two counts of
    breach of undertaking.  All counts in the indictment, other than the counts
    relating to breach of undertaking, arose from alleged sexual assaults against
    S.M. and M.A.  The trial judge sentenced the appellant, who was 19 years
    of age at the time of the offences, to 22.5 years imprisonment, after granting
    a 4.5-year credit for pre-trial custody, resulting in an effective global
    sentence of 27 years. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    conviction appeal rests on four grounds.  The appellant argues that the trial
    judge erred in the following respects: first, in dismissing the appellant’s
    motion to sever the counts; second, in failing to give the jury a propensity
    instruction; third, in failing to instruct the jury regarding prior consistent
    statements; and fourth, in improperly instructing the jury regarding the
    presumption of innocence and the burden of proof. The sentence appeal challenges
    the sentence as demonstrably unfit and based on an error in principle.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeals.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>II.        BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <h3>The facts</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was charged with sexually assaulting S.M. on September 27, 2003,
    the day of S.M.’s nineteenth birthday.  The appellant and S.M. first met
    the previous day.  On the day of the assault, the appellant accepted S.M.’s
    invitation to join him at a club.  A friend of S.M. offered S.M. and the
    appellant a ride from the club.  When they arrived at the appellant’s home,
    S.M. announced that she would not accompany the appellant.  However, the
    appellant was insistent and would not leave the car.  In order not to inconvenience
    her friend, S.M. accompanied the appellant, but with the intention of calling
    a taxi from the appellant’s home.  Once inside the home, according to S.M.,
    the appellant threatened her with a gun and repeatedly sexually assaulted
    her in various ways, including both vaginally and anally.  S.M. testified
    that, during the attack, the appellant choked her on several occasions and
    she repeatedly lost consciousness. S.M. eventually escaped.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    her sister noticed red marks on S.M.’s neck the next morning, there were
    no visible injuries when S.M. attended at the hospital two days later.  In
    addition to S.M.’s evidence, another witness testified that she had seen
    the appellant with a gun on three other occasions.  The appellant testified
    to consensual sex with S.M. and denied owning a gun.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    other sexual assault charges relate to M.A., who testified that she had not
    met the appellant before the events of October 29, 2003.  On that evening,
    a friend came to M.A.’s apartment in the company of the appellant, whom the
    friend said she was dating.  When the friend left to go to a bar, the appellant
    waited at M.A.’s apartment, allegedly because he did not have money to go
    to the bar.  M.A. testified that, soon after her friend’s departure, the
    appellant suddenly hit her in the forehead with her empty tea mug and then
    choked her into unconsciousness.  When she regained consciousness, M.A. suffered
    a seizure.  After she recovered from the seizure, she realized she was naked
    and bloody and sought help at her superintendents’ apartment.  She identified
    her attacker to her superintendents as a friend of a friend.  M.A. suffered
    extensive injuries consistent with an extremely violent and callous attack
    that included vaginal and anal assaults.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    time frame for the appellant’s opportunity to assault M.A. was approximately
    twenty minutes, based upon cell phone records.  In one call between M.A.’s
    friend and the appellant, the friend enquired about M.A.’s whereabouts.  The
    appellant responded that M.A. had been on the telephone with a man who was
    going to come to her apartment and it was for this reason that the appellant
    had left her apartment.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant testified at trial.  He denied the assault and explained that he
    had left M.A.’s apartment because she was expecting another man. There was
    no physical evidence linking the appellant to the assault on M.A.  The defence
    argued that the trauma of the assault and her injuries rendered M.A.’s memory
    unreliable. The defence also argued that the perpetrator was her ex-boyfriend,
    whom M.A. had seen earlier in the evening. As well, the defence pointed to
    the brief twenty-minute window of opportunity, the absence of the appellant’s
    DNA at the scene, the inadequacies of the police investigation, and the lack
    of blood on the appellant’s clothes. The defence argued that these factors
    belied the appellant’s involvement in the attack.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>III.       ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span
lang=EN-US>CONVICTION APPEAL</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    will deal with each of the grounds of appeal in turn, incorporating into
    my discussion the trial judge’s rulings or jury instructions regarding each
    issue.</p>
  <h3>1.         Did the trial judge err in refusing to sever the counts?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    591(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> empowers the Crown to include a number
    of offences in an indictment.  Thus, the premise is that counts included
    in an indictment will be tried together, absent severance.  Section 591(3)
    of the <i>Code</i> provides that the court “may” sever counts “where it is
    satisfied that the interests of justice so require”.   It is evident from
    the submissions on the severance motion, and from the trial judge’s ruling,
    that he was alive to these provisions of the <i>Code</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his five-page ruling, the trial judge recognized the burden on the appellant
    to persuade him that severance was in the interests of justice on a balance
    of probabilities.  He considered <i>R. v. L.E.</i> (1994), 94 C.C.C. (3d)
    228 at 238 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), where Finlayson J.A. set out the applicable factors to be considered on
    a severance motion. These factors include general prejudice, the factual
    and legal nexus between the counts, the complexity of the evidence (a factor
    given less weight in a non-jury trial), the possibility of inconsistent verdicts,
    an intention of the accused to testify on one count as opposed to the other,
    and the desire to avoid a multiplicity of proceedings.  Counsel do not challenge
    these factors, nor the principle that no one factor is determinative; rather,
    all factors must be weighed to determine whether severance is in the “interests
    of justice”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applying
    those criteria to this case, the trial judge was not persuaded that a trial
    on all counts would prejudice the appellant because the trial judge could
    negate any potential prejudice by instructing the jury how to deal with the
    evidence.  The trial judge expressed the view that juries “are capable of
    understanding clear instructions.”  As well, in considering the other relevant
    factors, the trial judge found a nexus between the two assaults, both of
    which were sexual in nature, on the basis that they occurred
    “roughly one month apart”. The trial judge observed that the case was not
    complex, and that the possibility of inconsistent verdicts did “not loom
    large”.
      He noted that the position advanced by the appellant’s trial counsel regarding
    the appellant’s intention to testify
    “was taken so vaguely as not to constitute a significant factor”.  Finally,
    he observed that the avoidance of a multiplicity of proceedings favoured
    a dismissal of the motion.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    noting the “rather open-ended criteria” for severance, the trial judge concluded
    that the appellant had not met the onus to establish his case for severance.  Accordingly,
    the trial judge dismissed the motion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    test on appellate review of a severance ruling was set out in <i>R. v. Litchfield</i> (1993),
    86 C.C.C. (3d) 97 at 113-114 (S.C.C.), where Iacobucci J. recognized that
    the broad criteria of the test for severance give a trial judge a “great
    deal of discretion”.  In reviewing such an exercise of discretion, Iacobucci
    J. instructed that appellate interference is only permissible where “the
    issuing judge acted unjudicially” or “the ruling resulted in an injustice.”  As
    I will explain, in my view, the trial judge in this case did not act unjudicially,
    nor did his ruling result in an injustice.  </p>
  <h3><span> </span>(a)      Did the trial judge act unjudicially?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge correctly recited the law. He took into account all relevant
    factors and did not consider irrelevant factors. His reasons reflect a reasonable
    balancing of those factors. Accordingly, in my view, he acted judicially.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the factor of the nexus between the counts, the trial judge specifically
    referred to the approximately five-week period between the two assaults and
    found a nexus in time between the two sets of charges.  He was also alive
    to the Crown's position that it would not be relying on any similar act evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    well, the trial judge was cognizant that the nexus between the counts had
    to be weighed with the other factors, particularly the potential prejudice
    to the appellant.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s concern about prejudice is evident both in his discussions
    with counsel in the course of submissions and in his reasons.  It was his
    view, at that juncture in the proceedings, that any potential risk of prejudice
    could be addressed by clear instructions to the jury.  He explained his reasoning
    in his ruling:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>As to general prejudice, I am not persuaded that,
    at trial, the question of prejudice will be a significant factor at all.  I,
    as the trial judge, have the duty to instruct the jury on how to deal with
    the evidence on the two sets of counts, and that is not a difficult matter
    in my view.  Modern juries, whatever the case was in the past, are well educated,
    and are capable of understanding clear instructions.  Judges are required
    to give clear instructions and, as it seems to me, a modern jury should be
    able to handle the instructions given by me to avoid any meaningful possibility
    of prejudice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Regarding
    the other factors, the trial judge noted the lack of complexity presented
    by the case, the unlikelihood of inconsistent verdicts, the vague reference
    by counsel to the appellant’s intention to testify, and the purpose of joining
    counts to avoid a multiplicity of proceedings.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    arriving at the decision to refuse severance, the trial judge saw “no reason
    in principle” to sever the counts.  In other words, defence counsel failed
    to persuade the trial judge that severance was required on the applicable
    standard of a balance of probabilities.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My
    colleague, Juriansz J.A., takes the view that the trial judge gave insufficient
    weight to the factors of potential prejudice and the appellant’s intention
    to testify on one set of counts.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    support of his position that the trial judge failed to adequately weigh the
    potential prejudice, Juriansz J.A. refers to three decisions of this court
    overturning dismissals of severance motions.  However, in my view, those
    decisions are distinguishable from the facts of this case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first of those cases is <i>R. v. F.S.</i> [1995], 83 O.A.C. 76 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), which involved alleged separate sexual assaults against a mother and her
    daughter.  On appeal, this court was concerned about potential prejudice
    resulting from the trial of all the counts together.  The concern was that,
    if the jury determined the mother was credible regarding the assault against
    her, the jury would also likely accept that the mother was credible regarding
    the charges respecting her six-year old daughter.  This was particularly
    important because much of the evidence regarding the charges involving the
    child was given by her mother.  That case is quite different from this one,
    where the two complainants and two assaults are separate.  Here, one complainant
    would not be testifying about any aspect of the assault against the other.
    Accordingly, in this case, unlike in <i>F.S.</i>, the danger of cross-pollination
    on credibility assessments could be more readily controlled with an appropriate
    instruction to the jury.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second case that Juriansz J.A. refers to is <i>R. v. Thomas</i> (2004), 190
    C.C.C. (3d) 31 (Ont. C.A.) where this court also concluded that the trial
    judge erred in dismissing a motion to sever.  <i>Thomas</i>, which involved
    fourteen complainants and similar act evidence, was considerably more complex
    than this case.  As well, unlike this case, <i>Thomas</i> involved significantly
    different sexual acts in regard to two groups of complainants. This court
    upheld the convictions relating to a group of four of the complainants, but
    ordered a new trial for the group of fourteen complainants.  I note that
    there was no suggestion that the group of fourteen should be further subdivided
    into separate trials for the counts relating to each of the complainants.  Viewed
    in this light, I find <i>Thomas</i> of little assistance to the facts of
    this case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    Juriansz J.A. relies on <i>R. v. B.M.</i> (1998), 130 C.C.C. (3d) 353 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  That case also involved very different circumstances.  In particular,
    the indictment in that case included many counts of sexual assault against
    family members as well as two further counts alleging bestiality.  This court
    observed that the bestiality charges were very different in kind from the
    alleged sexual assaults and that potential prejudice could result if the
    jury were influenced by the depravity of the bestiality conduct.  Accordingly,
    the court was of the view that the bestiality counts ought to have been severed
    from the other counts.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the assault against M.A. was unquestionably more brutal physically, the assault
    against S.M. also involved significant violence, given both the gun threat
    and the act of choking.  M.A. and S.M. both alleged that they were choked
    into unconsciousness and sexually assaulted anally and vaginally. Accordingly,
    the facts in one set of counts were unlikely, on their own, to inflame the
    jury regarding the other set of counts.  In any event, the prejudice resulting
    from any potential cross-pollination in this case could be offset by a proper
    instruction to the jury.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    also note that there are numerous decisions of this court refusing to interfere
    in a trial judge’s exercise of discretion on the issue of severance: see,
    for example, <span class=bold1><i><span lang=EN style='font-weight:normal;

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Juriansz
    J.A. is also of the view that the trial judge gave insufficient weight to
    the information regarding the appellant’s intention to testify, which was
    given to the court by the appellant’s trial counsel during the severance
    argument.  At that time, defence trial counsel did not say that the appellant
    intended to testify on one count but not the other.  All she said was that
    it was more probable that he would have an intention to testify on the S.M.
    counts regarding whether the sexual activity was consensual. This was because
    the M.A. counts were, according to trial defence counsel, “more dependent
    on other evidence”.  She did not elaborate, but only argued that the counts
    should be separated so that the appellant could then decide whether to testify.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view,  the trial judge was entitled to categorize this position as “vague” and
    to accord it little weight.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    any event, the appellant was likely to testify on the S.M. counts because
    his defence was that the sexual activity with S.M. was consensual.  However,
    it was also likely that he would testify on the M.A. counts, since he admitted
    being in M.A.’s apartment on the night of the assault.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    certainly not determinative, I observe the appellant never renewed his severance
    motion at any point during the trial and that, in the result, he testified
    regarding both sets of charges.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    but importantly, in my view, it would be an error to over-emphasize general
    prejudice and intention to testify to the virtual exclusion of the other
    factors.  If potential prejudice and potential testimony by the accused are
    the dominant factors in determining severance motions, such motions would
    be routinely granted in a myriad of other cases, including, for example,
    cases involving multiple counts of break and enter or robbery.  The result
    would be an effective reversal of the current burden of proof on the accused
    to establish the need for a severance.  It could exponentially increase the
    number of trials before the courts, further overburden an already strained
    system of justice (including the legal aid system) and increase the burden
    for witnesses who would often be required to attend at multiple trials.  It
    is incumbent on the trial judge to weigh all the factors, including the need
    to avoid an unnecessary multiplicity of proceedings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is helpful to return to the <i>Criminal Code</i> requirement that the court
    decide a severance motion
    “in the interests of justice”.  The interests of justice include, but are
    not limited to, the interests of the accused.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    conclude that there was nothing unjudicial in the trial judge’s decision
    that the interests of justice did not mandate separate trials in the circumstances
    of this case.  </p>
  <h3><span> </span>(b)      Did the trial judge’s ruling result in injustice?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s secondary argument is that the severance ruling resulted in an
    injustice to his client. In my view, injustice would only result if the trial
    judge’s charge failed to explain to the jury that the evidence relating to
    each event was to be considered separately. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    prejudice argued by the appellant is the trial judge’s failure to give an
    appropriate propensity instruction.  This issue is raised as a separate ground
    of appeal and I will address it separately.  As Charron J.A. observed in <i>Rose</i> at
    para. 17, the issue of injustice requires consideration of the entire trial.  In
    this case, that includes consideration of the substance of the charge, the
    absence of a request for a specific propensity instruction, and the appellant’s
    decision to testify without renewing his severance motion. It is sufficient
    at this point to observe that, in my view, the trial judge’s charge to the
    jury adequately instructed the jury against impermissible reasoning.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    conclude on this issue that the experienced trial judge made no error in
    dismissing the appellant’s severance motion.  He applied the correct principles,
    was cognizant of all the relevant factors, considered counsel’s lengthy submissions
    and explained why he dismissed the severance motion.  I see no basis upon
    which to interfere with his exercise of discretion.  </p>
  <h3>2.         Did the trial judge err in failing to instruct the jury regarding
    propensity reasoning?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    his charge to the jury, the trial judge correctly and repeatedly explained
    the meaning of the presumption of innocence and proof beyond a reasonable
    doubt. He also emphasized the importance of both principles.  The trial judge
    fully explained to the jury at length their responsibilities under the three-step
    analysis in <i>R. v. W.(D.)</i> (1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 397 (S.C.C.). While
    the trial judge did not specifically caution the jury against “propensity”
    reasoning, he clearly instructed the jury to keep the evidence on each set
    of counts separate. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that the trial judge was obliged to instruct the jury that
    they could not use a finding of credibility or guilt on one set of charges
    to infer that the appellant was a bad person or the kind of person who would
    commit the crimes alleged in the other set of charges.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  The appellant also argues that a similar warning
    was necessary in relation to the gun evidence in the S.M. case. In my view,
    reading the charge as a whole, the trial judge’s instruction was sufficient
    to guard against impermissible propensity reasoning by the jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition to charging the jury regarding the presumption of innocence, proof
    beyond a reasonable doubt, and the <i>W.(D.)</i> requirements, the trial
    judge gave the following instruction:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Now, I want you to keep this in mind during your
    deliberations. The sets of charges, the two sets of charges, one set relating
    to [M.A.], one set relating to [S.M.], <u>you cannot use the evidence on
    one set of those charges, as you assess the evidence on the other set of
    charges and vice versa. There is no overlap. You cannot use the evidence
    on the charges relating to [M.A.] when you are assessing the charges relating
    to [S.M.] and vice versa</u>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><u>You must segregate the evidence</u> and examine
    it separately, that relating to [M.A.’s] case and you know what that was.
    [M.A.] says, I am innocently seated on a couch in my apartment and this man
    attacks me. <u>You cannot use that evidence to infer guilt or to assist the
    case with respect to the other woman</u>, and vice versa. It is as simple
    as that. <u>It would be profoundly unfair</u> to the accused if you did that.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><u>So you must segregate the evidence</u> with
    respect to each alleged victim. Look at it and see if it proves those offences
    but <u>you cannot use it with respect to the other alleged victim’s cases</u>.
    All right, I know you will not do that, it would not be fair and it would
    not be proper.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge immediately thereafter cautioned the jury that the appellant’s
    criminal record could not be used to conclude that the appellant was more
    likely to be guilty of the charges he was facing:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I want you to clearly understand the limitations
    that you must put on that evidence during your deliberations, very important.
    You can only use the evidence of those convictions in assessing his credibility,
    the accused person’s credibility as a witness in the witness box. You cannot
    use those prior convictions as evidence of guilt on any of these charges
    per se, only in weighing his credibility. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The theory of the law is that if an accused has
    been convicted of prior offences and testifies, those convictions can be
    brought out for the purpose of assessing his credibility as a witness, nothing
    more. You cannot infer from those that he was guilty on these charges before
    us today because of those prior convictions.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>They may assist you or they may not assist you
    in deciding whether he is a truthful witness, that is for you  to decide,
    but nothing more than that. The law assumes that they may be of assistance
    to a jury in assessing credibility of the accused but nothing more. You cannot
    draw any inferences of guilt on these charges from those prior convictions.
    Please remember that and honour that instruction. I know you will. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the trial judge informed the jury that, if their recollections about the
    evidence differed from the trial judge’s comments about the evidence, the
    jury should rely on their own recollections.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    specific propensity instruction would have told the jury not to use a finding
    of guilt in relation to one of the assaults to decide that the appellant
    was the sort of person who would have committed the other assault.  While
    the trial judge did not use the word “propensity”, he explained to the jury
    in clear, comprehensible language not to use the evidence (or a finding of
    guilt) on one set of counts to conclude that the appellant would have committed
    the assault in the other set of counts. The jury would have been left in
    no doubt that they were required to completely isolate the two sets of counts
    and to apply the presumption of innocence to each set.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    the trial judge’s instruction as a whole, including the charge regarding
    the use to be made of past convictions, the jury would have clearly understood
    that they were prohibited from inferring that the appellant was more likely
    to have committed an offence based on the other counts in the indictment,
    the gun evidence or the appellant’s prior criminal acts.  Thus, in my view,
    the trial judge’s charge foreclosed any potential propensity reasoning.  The
    trial judge made it abundantly clear that the two sets of charges were to
    be kept separate and, specifically, that the evidence from one set of charges
    could not be used “to infer guilt or to assist the case” on the other set
    of charges. The jury would have understood from this that they could not
    use the fact of two complainants to bolster the credibility of one or both
    complainants. The jury would also have understood from the charge as a whole,
    including the instructions regarding past convictions, that a finding of
    guilt on one set of charges could not be used to infer guilt on the other. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My
    colleague points out that, on one occasion in his charge, the trial judge
    misspoke and placed a gun in the M.A. assault.  The trial judge also, on
    several occasions, misspoke M.A.’s name, confusing her name with a complainant
    in another trial.  The jury would have understood these errors to be mere
    slips of the tongue. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    also note that this jury undertook careful deliberations, from approximately
    3:30 pm to 9:30 pm on the first day and during the whole of the next day,
    arriving at their verdict at 5:00 pm.  While deliberating, the jury asked
    only one question, which was specifically related to the S.M. counts.  The
    jury gave no indication that they failed to understand the trial judge’s
    instructions. It is also significant that trial defence counsel did not request
    a propensity instruction either before or after the charge, presumably because
    counsel considered that the charge fairly and adequately set forth the necessary
    caution for the jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the specific issue of the gun evidence, it would have been clear to the jury,
    based on the manner in which the evidence was called and discussed at trial,
    that the gun evidence related only to the S.M. charges.  Moreover, the trial
    judge’s instructions to keep the evidence separate would have served to forestall
    any risk that the jury would have improperly used the gun evidence. <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, the evidence about the appellant possessing a gun was significantly
    less serious than the conduct with which the appellant was charged.  It has
    been held that the risk of propensity reasoning decreases where the evidence
    of the accused’s misconduct is of a different nature than the conduct charged: <i>R.
    v. N.P.C.</i> (2007), <span class=ssl21><span
lang=EN>222 C.C.C. (3d) 559 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  Here, the primary focus of the trial was on the separate sexual assaults
    and choking conduct, not on the appellant’s possession of a gun.  </span></span>In
    these circumstances, it is not realistic to assume that the jury would have
    engaged in propensity reasoning or would have sought to punish the appellant
    based on the evidence that, at one point, he had a gun. <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I indicated earlier, trial defence counsel did not request the limiting instructions
    raised on appeal and made no objection to their absence from the charge to
    the jury.  While trial counsel’s failure to do so is not determinative, it
    provides some indication that further instructions were not thought necessary
    at the time to ensure a fair trial and that the instructions given by the
    trial judge caused no prejudice to the appellant:  see <i><span lang=EN>R.

    trial, M.A. identified the appellant, the visitor who came with her friend,
    as her attacker.  She also testified that it had been hard for her at the
    preliminary inquiry to “see the person that had hurt me so badly” and that
    she was “100 per cent certain who hurt me.” As well, at trial, M.A. and one
    of her superintendents testified that, when M.A. sought help on the night
    of the attack, she told her superintendents that her attacker was a friend
    of her friend and she named the friend.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    discussion of this evidence during the precharge conference, Crown counsel
    did not ask that the jury be told that the evidence was admissible for the
    truth of its contents.  However, the evidence took on more significance after
    counsel’s submissions to the jury.  In closing, trial defence counsel attacked
    the reliability of M.A.’s identification on the basis of the extensive trauma
    she suffered.  In response, the trial Crown counsel told the jury:  “[M.A.]
    tells [the superintendent] right way, friend of a friend. She tells the police,
    she tells [the examining nurse] details, she tells the preliminary inquiry
    and she testifies at trial, and never once does she shift on who done it.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defence did not object to this response by Crown counsel and made no request
    for a particular instruction.  The trial judge made no reference to the matter
    in his charge, and neither counsel raised the issue.  On appeal, the appellant
    argues both that the appellant was prejudiced by the trial judge’s failure
    to instruct the jury regarding the limited purpose of M.A.’s prior consistent
    identifications and by Crown counsel’s overstatement of the prior identifications.</p>

    do not agree with the appellant’s counsel that the prior consistent identifications
    could not be used to assess M.A.’s identification of the appellant as her
    attacker.  In <i>R. v. Tat</i> (1997), 117 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">

    identifications at para. 37:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>If a witness identifies an accused
      at trial, evidence of previous identifications made and descriptions given
      is admissible to allow the trier of fact to make an informed determination

      will consider the entirety of the identification process as revealed by
      the evidence before deciding what weight should be given to the identification
      made by the identifying witness. Evidence of the circumstances surrounding
      any prior identifications and the details of prior descriptions given will
      be central to that assessment. [Footnote omitted.] </span></p>

    the appellant’s identity was not an issue at trial in the traditional sense
    (since it was common ground that the appellant had been alone with M.A. in
    her apartment before the attack), the reliability of M.A.’s identification
    of the appellant was challenged. It was challenged both on the basis of M.A.’s
    trauma and on the basis of her evidence that her attacker, from the “look
    in his eyes”, “looked like a different person.”  In my view, in these circumstances,
    the prior consistent identification evidence was admissible to assist the
    jury in assessing the reliability of M.A.’s identification of the appellant
    as her attacker in accordance with the principle in <i>Tat</i>: see also <i>R.
    v. B.A., </i>[2008] O.J. No. 2739 (

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    the absence of an explicit instruction about this evidence did not prejudice
    the defence and may have inured to its benefit.  In any event, it would have
    been very evident to the jury in this uncomplicated trial that a central
    issue was the effect of M.A.’s injuries on the reliability of her post-assault
    identification.  The jury would have exercised its common sense to consider
    the whole of the evidence in determining what weight to give to M.A.’s identification. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also takes issue with trial Crown counsel’s closing reference to
    M.A.’s identification of the appellant to the police, to the nurse and at
    the preliminary inquiry.  Regarding the preliminary inquiry, M.A. testified
    at trial about encountering the appellant, whom she described as her attacker,
    at the preliminary inquiry.  Although she did not specifically testify at
    trial about her preliminary inquiry evidence, it was a reasonable inference
    from her trial evidence about the preliminary inquiry that she identified
    the appellant at that time.  Crown counsel did not mislead the jury in her
    reference to that evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Neither
    was the reference to the police misleading. Police officers testified at
    trial that, after the attacks, M.A. told them that her named friend knew
    the identity of her assailant.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial Crown did err in referring to M.A.’s identification to the nurse, since
    that identification was not part of the trial evidence. However, this reference
    resulted in no prejudice to the appellant because it added nothing to M.A.’s
    identifications immediately after the attack to her superintendents and to
    the police.  In addition, the trial judge explicitly told the jury in his
    charge to depend on their recollection of the evidence rather than on that
    of counsel and to exercise their common sense.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I

  <h3>4.         Did the trial judge improperly instruct the jury on their duty

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant argues that the trial judge improperly left the jury with the impression
    that they were required to determine the truth about the events in question
    and were required to choose between the complainants’ and the appellant’s
    versions of the events. The appellant refers to a passage in the trial judge’s
    charge where he instructed the jury to review the evidence to help decide “what
    are the important issues in this case and what are the important pieces of
    evidence upon which your findings will be made as to what really happened
    in these two incidents”. The appellant also refers to another statement by
    the trial judge where he told the jury they were chosen “because it is expected
    that you will be able to determine what the truth of this case is from your
    careful deliberations”.  In addition, when the trial judge suggested guidelines
    to assess the evidence, such as the manner of the witnesses’ testimony and
    the background facts underlying the evidence, he noted that, since there
    were conflicts in the testimony, the jury was required to “resolve those
    by using those guidelines and any that you think are better…”</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    challenged extracts are merely isolated passages. A parsing of the charge
    ignores the complete, repeated and unchallenged instructions by the trial
    judge regarding the presumption of innocence, the burden of proof, and the<i> W.(D.)</i> requirements.  The
    trial judge’s instructions on these issues were careful and correct.  They
    would have left the jury with no doubt about the proper methodology to apply
    to their task.  As Cory J. wrote for the majority in <i>W.(D.)</i> at p.
    409-10, “[w]here <span
lang=EN style='letter-spacing:-.15pt;'>an error is made in the instruction on
    the burden of proof, the fact that the trial judge correctly instructed on

    to an additional ten years for the offences of sexual assault with a weapon
    and overcoming resistance by choking of S.M.  In addition, the trial judge
    imposed a sentence of one month each for the two breaches of undertaking,
    to be served concurrent to each other and to the other sentences.</p>

    the time of the offences, the appellant was 19 years old with an unrelated
    and relatively minor criminal record. The trial judge determined that the
    appellant had some prospect of rehabilitation.  The appellant argues that,
    in these circumstances, the combined sentence of 27 years offended the principle
    of totality and ignored his prospects for rehabilitation.  He proposes a
    sentence of 10 years in relation to the assault on M.A. and 5 years in relation

    the time of sentencing, the trial judge had dismissed the Crown’s dangerous
    offender application because he rejected the expert opinion given on behalf
    of the Crown that the appellant was a sexual sadist and psychopath.  Instead,
    the trial judge accepted that the appellant suffered from antisocial personality
    disorder that was treatable on a reasonable possibility standard.  In his
    admittedly brief sentencing reasons, the trial judge noted that the crimes
    against M.A. resembled cases where life imprisonment was imposed for a grave
    single instance of sexual assault.  In imposing a 17-year sentence, he noted
    the principles of proportionality, denunciation and deterrence.  He refused
    to impose a concurrent sentence for the crimes in regard to S.M., noting
    that to do so would “make a mockery of our sentencing laws” because the convictions
    related to separate crimes committed at different times.</p>

      not be unduly long or harsh.” </span></p>

    my view, while the combined sentence imposed by the trial judge fell at the
    high end of the appropriate range, the sentence did not offend the principle
    of totality because it did not exceed the appellant’s overall culpability
    for the offences.  The sentence could not be said to be outside a range that
    was other than just and appropriate in light of the callous circumstances
    of the offences and the lack of remorse shown by the appellant.  See also <i><span lang=EN>R.

    sets of offences were unprovoked, extremely violent, and demonstrated complete
    disregard for the victims.  In both instances, the appellant created opportunities
    to be alone with each of the women, whom he had just met. The appellant choked
    both women into unconsciousness and left M.A. alone while she was unconscious
    and bleeding from the head.  The M.A. assault took place in the “security” of
    her home.  The S.M. assault included coercion with the use of a gun.  Both
    victims suffered greatly, although undoubtedly the increased violence against
    the second victim, M.A., was more significant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    was no explanation for the appellant’s conduct and a virtual absence of mitigating
    circumstances apart from his relative youth and the absence of significant
    earlier sentences of imprisonment. The appellant showed neither remorse for
    his crimes nor acceptance of any need for treatment.  In addition, the antisocial
    personality disorder  from which he suffers is difficult to treat.  He is
    at risk of re-offending.  </p>

    it is difficult to compare sentences in the disparate circumstances of offences
    and offenders, the individual sentences imposed by the trial judge did not
    exceed those imposed in other situations, as evidenced by many of the cases
    cited in counsels’ sentencing charts.  In addition to those cases, I note
    the life sentence imposed in <span class=bold1><i><span

    sexual assaults against a 19-year-old and a 44-year-old woman, one of which
    involved the use of a knife.  In the appellant’s case, the Crown also sought
    a life sentence. Life sentences for serious sexual offences were also imposed

    reasons, while brief, immediately followed the dangerous offender hearing.  In
    his reasons on the dangerous offender application, the trial judge was not
    only alive to the appellant’s prospects for rehabilitation, but they were
    a central focus of that hearing.  The trial judge’s sentencing reasons must

    the early hours of October 29, 2003, M.A. was feeling tired and ill. Her
    friend S.K. called and said she wanted to bring over her new boyfriend. Even
    though M.A. was reluctant, she said yes when S.K. promised they would not
    stay long since they were on their way to a birthday party at a nearby bar. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When

    tea. S.K. subsequently got a call from the friend having the birthday party.
    S.K. wanted to go to the party and encouraged the appellant to go with her.
    He said he did not want to go because he did not have any money and he did
    not like to go to a bar without money.  He said that he would stay at the

    it right in the middle of her forehead. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>M.A.’s
    evidence was that the appellant then came towards her, grabbed her by the
    throat, and started to choke her hard with both of his hands until she lost
    consciousness. When she came to, she had a seizure. After the seizure ended,
    she noticed blood on her arms and face, and realized that she was naked.  She
    grabbed a towel and then went to get out of her apartment to get help.  </p>

    bolt on her door could only be locked from the inside or from the outside
    with a key.  When she had come home that evening, she had placed the keys
    on a small wooden bench by the door.  She said that she never saw those keys

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She
    managed to get out and go to her superintendent’s apartment, and told him

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    medical examination revealed that M.A. had suffered extensive injuries, including
    significant bruising to her face, scalp, arm and neck, and a serious cut
    on her nose.  She had three tears in her anal area, an abrasion on the hymeneal
    tissue of her vagina, which suggested that her vagina had been struck or
    manipulated so as to cause the outer layers of the hymen to tear away, and
    abrasions to her cervix consistent with a manufactured object having been

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>S.K.
    testified and her testimony confirmed M.A.’s version of events to the point
    of her departure for the party.  S.K. estimated that she stayed at the party
    for about 20 minutes, and after leaving the bar, received a call from the
    appellant asking her to meet him at her place in ten minutes.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    speaking to the appellant, she called M.A. but got no answer. She then went
    to M.A.’s apartment to check on her, but got no answer when she buzzed. She
    estimated that this was at around 1:45 or 2:00 a.m.  S.K. said that she then
    called the appellant and asked him where M.A. was but he said that he did
    not know. He told S.K. that M.A. had been on the phone with some guy and
    he thought the guy was going to come over and so he left.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>S.K.
    returned home and the appellant arrived wearing the same clothes he had been
    in earlier.  She noticed a small red mark on the left hip area of his white
    jersey, which she thought was lipstick.  She asked him about the mark and
    he said it was already there.  She said that he used the washroom and then
    left her house and did not return.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also testified. He denied striking M.A. in the head with a mug,
    choking or assaulting her. He testified that shortly after S.K. left, M.A.
    told him there was a guy coming over, and so he left and called S.K. He told
    her he would meet her at her house. When S.K. called him back and asked him
    where M.A. was, he said that he did not know.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    said he reached S.K.’s house around 2:15 or 2:20 a.m. He saw five people
    there, including S.K. and two guys he had had a
    “problem with the week before at that club.”  He went to the washroom and
    then told S.K. that he had to leave because he did not wish to associate
    them. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    was no physical evidence linking the appellant to the crime against M.A.  The
    police did not send the clothing he wore that night for forensic testing.
    His clothing worn on the night in question was not seized by police.  No
    fingerprints were found on any items in M.A.’s apartment.  Testing of fingernail
    scrapings and a penis swab from the appellant at the time of his arrest at
    approximately 1:00 a.m. on October 30, 2003 did not yield any DNA other than
    his own.  None of the samples taken from M.A. yielded DNA other than her
    own. The Crown’s theory was that the appellant sexually assaulted her using
    some kind of instrument.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Defence
    counsel submitted that the complainant’s memory was not reliable because
    she had suffered unconsciousness. Counsel sought to introduce M.A.’s ex-boyfriend
    as the perpetrator: he had keys to her apartment, and M.A. admitted she saw
    him on her way home that night and he was looking at her. She also testified
    that when they were dating, he was at times emotionally abusive and had pushed
    her.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defence also submitted that the confirmed timelines made it improbable that
    the appellant was the attacker, since there was not enough time to carry
    about the brutal attack. S.K.’s time of departure was confirmed to be about
    1:45 a.m., and cell phone records confirmed that she spoke to the appellant
    by phone at 2:05 a.m. and at 2:13 a.m.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel

    trial judge recognized that the case law has attempted, over the years, to
    fashion some criteria for the exercise of the broad discretion granted by
    s. 591(3). He applied the factors stated by Finlayson J.A. in <i>R. v. E.(L.)</i> (1994),
    94 C.C.C. (3d) 228 at 238 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    ):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The relevant factors to be considered
      by a trial judge on a motion to grant severance are general prejudice and
      the factual and legal nexus between the counts (<i>R. v. Simpson </i>(1977),
      35 C.C.C. (2d) 337, 77 D.L.R. (3d) 507, 16 O.R. (2d) 129 (C.A.)); the undue
      complexity of the evidence (<i>R. v. Chamandy</i> (1934), 61 C.C.C. 224,
      [1934] O.R. 208 (C.A.); <i>R. v. McNamara</i> <i>(No. 1)</i> (1981), 56

      three unrelated exceptions, 56 C.C.C. (2d) 576<i>n</i>, 37 N.R. 85<i>n</i>));
      the possibility of inconsistent verdicts; whether the accused intends to
      testify on one count but not another; and the desire to avoid a multiplicity
      of proceedings.  The existence of a jury is not a specific factor, but
      the fact that there is not going to be a jury means that the consideration
      of complexity, and to a lesser extent prejudice, will not have the same
      weight.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[113]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found there was a nexus in time and place between the two sets
    of charges because “[t]he incidents giving rise to the charges only occurred
    roughly one month apart”. He stated he was “not persuaded that, at trial,
    the question of prejudice will be a significant factor at all” given that
    the trial judge had the duty to instruct the jury on how to deal with the
    evidence on the two sets of counts. He observed that modern juries are well
    educated and capable of understanding clear instructions. He also found this
    was not a complex case, the possibility of inconsistent verdicts did not
    pose a problem, and the question of multiplicity of proceedings favored non
    severance.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[114]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the trial judge commented on defence counsel’s submission that the accused
    might wish to testify on one set of counts but not the other. He refused
    to recognize this as a significant factor because “that point was taken so
    vaguely”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge gave the jury clear instructions to keep the evidence on each
    of the sets of counts separate. He instructed the jury as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Now, I want you to keep this in mind during your
    deliberations. The sets of charges, the two sets of charges, one set relating
    to [M.A.], one set relating to [S.M.], you cannot use the evidence on one
    set of those charges, as you assess the evidence on the other set of charges
    and vice versa. There is no overlap. You cannot use the evidence on the charges
    relating to [M.A.] when you are assessing the charges relating to [S.M.]
    and vice versa.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>You must segregate the evidence and examine it
    separately, that relating to [M.A.’s] case and you know what that was. [M.A.]
    says, I am innocently seated on a couch in my apartment and this man attacks
    me. You cannot use that evidence to infer guilt or to assist the case with
    respect to the other woman, and vice versa. It is as simple as that. It would
    be profoundly unfair to the accused if you did that.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>So you must segregate the evidence with respect
    to each alleged victim. Look at it and see if it proves those offences but
    you cannot use it with respect to the other alleged victim’s cases. All right,

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[119]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    trial judge’s decision to refuse an application for severance is deserving
    of great deference. The wording of s. 591(3)(a) of the <i>Code</i> makes
    clear that the exercise of the court’s power is largely discretionary. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[120]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Supreme Court of Canada has commented on the broad and discretionary nature
    of the “interests of justice” standard. In <i>R. v. Litchfield</i> (1993),
    86 C.C.C. (3d) 97 at 113-114 (S.C.C.), Iacobucci J. cautioned that an appellate
    court should only intervene in two situations: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The criteria for when a count
      should be divided or a severance granted are contained in ss. 590(3) and
      591(3) of the <i>Code</i>. These criteria are very broad: the court must
      be satisfied that the ends or interests of justice require the order in
      question. Therefore, in the absence of stricter guidelines, making an order
      for the division or severance of counts requires the exercise of a great
      deal of discretion on the part of the issuing judge. The decisions of provincial
      appellate courts have held, and I agree, that <u>an appellate court should
      not interfere with the issuing judge's exercise of discretion unless it
      is shown that the issuing judge acted unjudicially or that the ruling resulted
      in an injustice</u>. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[121]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    this passage indicates, the first ground on which an appellate court may
    intervene is where the judge acted unjudicially. This requires that the appeal
    court defer to the trial judge unless there is an error in principle, a failure
    to consider a germane factor, or an incorrect weighing of an appropriate
    factor. As Doherty J.A. explained in <i>R. v. Savoury</i> (2005), 2000 C.C.C.
    (3d) 94 at paragraph 26:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This court will interfere with the exercise of
    that discretion where the trial judge had failed to consider the relevant
    principles, or has considered an irrelevant principle. If the trial judge
    has erred in principle, it falls to this court to decide, according to the
    proper principles, whether <span lang=EN-US>severance</span> should have
    been granted. Even if a trial judge has considered the relevant principles,
    this court will review the trial judge's exercise of her discretion against
    a reasonableness standard. As Laskin J.A. said in <i>R. v. McKnight</i> <span style='font-family:&quot;Times New \(W1\)&quot;;
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>(1999), 135 C.C.C. (3d)
    41</span> at 54 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), when referring to a different discretionary decision:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>The weighing of relevant factors, the balancing
    process is what the exercise of discretion is all about. To maintain deference
    to the trial judge's exercise of discretion, the weighing or balancing of
    relevant factors must be assessed against the reasonableness standard of
    review. <span lang=EN-US>Only if by emphasizing one factor or by not giving
    enough weight to another, the trial judge exercises his or her discretion
    unreasonably should an appellate court interfere</span> ... </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[122]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    as indicated in the passage of <i>Litchfield</i> set out above, an appellate
    court may interfere with a severance ruling if it results in an injustice.
    There is an element of hindsight in this analysis. As Charron J.A. speaking
    for this court in <i>R. v Rose</i>, [1997] O.J. No. 1947, 100 O.A.C. 67,
    explained at paragraph 17:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In determining this issue, it is necessary to consider
    the entire trial, including the potential prejudicial effect of the evidence,
    the closing addresses of counsel, the judge's instructions to the jury and
    any inference that may be drawn from the ultimate verdicts returned by the

    my view, it is appropriate to intervene on both grounds in this case: the
    trial judge acted unjudicially in failing to give appropriate weight to the
    relevant factors, and his failure to sever the two sets of counts resulted
    in an injustice. I discuss each basis for interfering with the trial judge’s

    only occurred roughly one month apart”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[127]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the nexus between the two sets of counts is exceedingly weak. Factually,
    the two cases involve different complainants. They occurred in different
    locations. They occurred approximately one month apart. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[128]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Legally,
    both sets of counts relate to sexual assault, but they raise different legal
    issues. In the S.M. case, the legal issue was consent, and in the M.A. case
    the issue was identification. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[129]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>None
    of the evidence on one set of cases was relevant or admissible on the other.
    At trial, the Crown agreed that none of the evidence qualified as similar
    fact evidence. There were no common witnesses, except perhaps the police
    investigators, and so any economy achieved would be marginal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[130]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    conclude that the nature of the nexus between the counts in this case did
    not provide a reason why it was necessary, desirable or convenient to try
    the cases together.  This factor should be given very little or no weight.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>(ii)      Potential Prejudice </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[131]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge noted “general prejudice” to the appellant but was satisfied
    it could be addressed through proper instruction to the jury. He did not
    specifically address the nature of the potential prejudice, except to note
    that the trial judge has a duty to instruct the jury on how to deal with
    the evidence on the two sets of counts. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[132]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    nature of the potential prejudice in having all the charges tried together
    took several forms in this case. First, the appellant faced prejudice in
    the way the jury approached credibility issues. There was a danger that the
    fact there were two sets of charges involving two different complainants
    would bolster the credibility of one or both complainants. Why would two
    women, who did not know one another, both accuse the appellant of sexual
    assault? </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[133]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the flip side, if the jury found the appellant not credible in regard to
    one set of counts it would be difficult for him to persuade them he was credible
    on the other. For instance, if the jury were to accept that M.A.’s identification
    of the appellant as the perpetrator of her brutal assault, it could undermine
    the appellant’s credibility in testifying that his sexual encounter with
    S.M. was consensual. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[134]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Another
    related danger was that the jury would engage in prohibited propensity reasoning.
    If the jury were to find that the Crown had proven its case with respect
    to one of the set of charges, they might infer that the appellant was the
    kind of person who would commit these types of crimes and convict on the
    second set of charges. For instance, if he were the type of person who had
    a gun and held it to S.M.’s head and then choked and sexually assaulted her,
    he would also be the type of person capable of the sudden, senseless and
    vicious attack on M.A.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[135]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    the potential prejudice was significant in the circumstances of this case.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>(iii)     Accused’s Decision Whether to Testify</span><span lang=EN-US
style='font-weight:normal;'> </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[136]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    submissions on the motion for severance, defence counsel indicated that the
    appellant would be more likely to testify with respect to the S.M. counts
    than with respect to the M.A. counts. As noted, the trial judge said that
    the “point was taken so vaguely as not to constitute a significant factor
    in this case”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[137]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, this factor also weighs in favour of severance in this particular
    case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[138]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An
    accused has the right to decide whether to testify after hearing the Crown’s
    case.  There is no requirement that an accused or his or her counsel state
    unequivocally that he or she will testify or not and commit themselves to
    that position in writing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[139]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Here,
    counsel raised the prospect that the appellant might wish to testify in one
    case but not the other. She explained that there was a greater probability
    he would testify in the S.M. case to assert his defence of consent. In the
    M.A. case, where identification was the issue, it could be reasonably anticipated
    that he would await the close of the Crown’s case before deciding whether
    to testify.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[140]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    there was some objectively discernible sense to the defence’s position that
    the accused might wish to testify in one case and not the other, this factor,
    while not decisive, weighs in favour of severance.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>(iv)    Additional Factors</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[141]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    noted, the trial judge also considered the possibility of inconsistent verdicts,
    the question of a multiplicity of proceedings, and the complexity of the
    evidence. In my view, none of these factors provide a rationale for a joint
    trial.       </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[142]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant could be found guilty in one case and not the other without leading
    to inconsistent verdicts, as the two cases were unrelated.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[143]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Refusing
    severance may have avoided multiple trials, but the economy achieved was
    marginal. Had severance been ordered, no witnesses, except the police investigators,
    would have had to testify at two trials instead of one. Even with the police
    investigators, there would have been no duplication in their testimony in
    the two trials. Two trials would have required two juries be selected rather
    than one, but this efficiency would not be a proper consideration in determining
    the “interests of justice”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[144]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the evidence in this case was not particularly complex, I note that in his
    charge to the jury the trial judge mistakenly tied the evidence that the
    appellant possessed a gun to the M.A. counts. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>(v)       Cumulative Weighing of Factors</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[145]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    indicated by Doherty J.A. in the passage from <i>R. v. Savoury</i> quoted
    above, despite the considerable deference owed to a trial judge’s severance
    decision, this court may interfere where the trial judge’s weighing and balancing
    of relevant factors results in an unreasonable decision. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[146]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    particularly significant factor weighing in favour of severance in this case
    was the potential prejudice to the accused.  While every case depends on
    its particular facts, I note that this court has intervened in a number of
    cases where, in deciding not to sever, the trial judge gave insufficient
    weight to the potential prejudice to the accused.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[147]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    instance, in <i>R. v. F.S.</i> [1995], 83 O.A.C. 76 at para. 7, this court
    concluded that “[t]he possibility of prejudice resulting from not severing
    in this case substantially outweighed the minor gain in efficiency in having
    all charges tried together.”
    In <i>F.S.</i>, the accused was charged with sexually assaulting a mother
    and her six-year-old daughter. The mother was a witness in relation to the
    charges involving her and those involving her daughter. This court was concerned
    that there was a substantial risk of prejudice to the accused in not granting
    severance: if the jury found the mother credible with respect to the charges
    involving her, it would be difficult for them to find her not credible with
    respect to the charges involving her daughter. As discussed above, similar
    types of credibility concerns arise in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[148]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    court also interfered with the severance decision in <i>R. v. Thomas</i> (2004),
    72 O.R. (3d) 401, where there was risk of serious prejudice to the accused.  The
    case involved an elementary school teacher charged with 22 counts of sexual
    abuse involving 14 students. Ten of the complainants alleged acts such as
    groping, fondling, hugging and kissing, generally over clothing. Four others
    alleged more serious acts, including fellatio and full sexual intercourse.
    Two of these also alleged the accused inserted a broom or hockey stick into
    their vagina.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[149]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rosenberg
    J.A. concluded that the evidence of the ten complainants was admissible on
    the trial of the four complainants. However, he held at para. 37 that “the
    evidence of the four complainants was not admissible against the appellant
    in respect of the ten complainants” and so “the trial judge should have severed
    those counts.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[150]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    reaching this conclusion, he considered the prejudicial nature of the evidence
    in relation to the four complainants. Quoting from <i>R. v. D(L.E.)</i> (1989),
    50 C.C.C. (3d) 142 at 159 (S.C.C.), he described the acts against the four
    complainants as arousing “sentiments of revulsion and condemnation” that
    could prevent the fair trial with respect to the ten complainants. Even though “[a]ll
    of the acts carried a high degree of moral repugnance” in that they involved
    a serious breach of trust by a teacher, Rosenberg J.A. recognized the different
    nature of the two sets of cases and the potential prejudice of trying them
    together. In this case, there is also a danger that “sentiments of condemnation” arising
    from the nature of the brutal attack on M.A. could prevent the jury from
    fairly considering the appellant’s defence that his sexual encounter with
    S.M. was consensual. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[151]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    third case in which this Court has expressed concern about prejudice and
    has interfered with a decision not to sever is <i>R. v. B.M.</i> (1998),
    130 C.C.C. (3d) 353. B.M. was charged indecent assault, invitation to sexual
    touching, detaining for illicit sexual intercourse, gross indecency, buggery,
    incest, assault causing bodily harm, weapons offences and bestiality. This
    court concluded that the trial judge ought to have severed the bestiality
    counts. Rosenberg J.A. stated at paras. 26 - 27:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There was a heavy onus on the Crown and the trial
    judge to ensure the appellant received a fair trial. In my view, the trial
    judge placed too much emphasis on the similarity of the charges and his view
    that the jury would not be inflamed by hearing the bestiality allegations.
    The bestiality charges were similar to most of the other counts only in the
    broadest sense that they involved a form of sexual behaviour. They were of
    a very different nature in all other ways. There was no need for the bestiality
    charges to be tried with the more serious counts: there is no nexus between
    them. Neither incident was necessary for the unfolding of the narrative and
    the evidence of bestiality was inadmissible on the other counts.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Joining the bestiality counts with the other counts
    served only to invite the jury to engage in the forbidden line of reasoning
    that the appellant was the type of person likely to commit acts of sexual
    misconduct. Thus, faced with an indictment including these charges, the trial
    judge should have granted the severance application. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[152]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  While
    the facts of <i>R. v. B.M.</i> are different, Rosenberg J.A.’s approach,
    comparing the level of potential prejudice with the reasons for trying the
    counts together, can be applied to this case. In this case, there was no
    need for the charges relating to S.M. to be tried with the charges relating
    to M.A., and joining the two sets of counts invited the jury to engage in
    forbidden propensity reasoning.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[153]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    summary, <i>F.S.</i>, <i>Thomas</i>, and <i>D.(L.E.)</i> illustrate that
    while this court is reluctant to interfere with severance decisions, it will
    do so where, on the particular facts of the case, the trial judge has given
    insufficient weight to the possibility of prejudice to the accused in weighing
    the relevant factors and in assessing what is required to satisfy the interests
    of justice.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[154]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, as I have outlined, there were real risks of prejudice to the
    appellant from hearing the counts together that weighed heavily in favour
    of severance.  The Crown strenuously argued that it was open to the trial
    judge to choose to address that prejudice by deciding to give a careful limiting
    instruction to the jury.  Regarding the option of dealing with potential
    prejudice by careful jury instruction as determinative in all circumstances
    would negate “general prejudice to the accused person” as an effective factor
    in the analysis.  It must be remembered that the analysis requires the cumulative
    weighing of all factors.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[155]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    note that the Crown cited no case in which the trial judge refused severance,
    choosing to deal with prejudice by a careful jury instruction, where there
    was not some countervailing reason to hear the counts together.  Here, the
    countervailing factors in favour of trying these two sets of charges together
    were negligible and the reasons to sever were compelling.  As a result, this
    was not a case to attempt to address the risk of prejudice by a jury instruction.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[156]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the trial judge in this case gave insufficient weight to the serious
    risk that there would be substantial prejudice to the accused and insufficient
    weight to the possibility the appellant might wish to testify in one case
    and not the other. At the same time, he placed too much weight on countervailing
    factors in favour of trying the counts together, particularly on the tenuous
    nexus between the counts. His error in weighing and balancing the factors
    obliges this court to interfere.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[157]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would conclude that the trial judge erred in assessing the weight of the
    relevant factors and their cumulative effect on the interests of justice.
    He ought to have exercised his discretion to order the two sets of counts
    severed.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>            (b)        Resulting
      Injustice </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[158]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> I
    would also find that the severance ruling resulted in injustice on two grounds.
    First, given the real risk of prejudice to the accused, it was essential
    that the trial judge, if he chose not to sever, deliver a strong limiting
    instruction to minimize that risk. While the trial judge instructed the jury<b> </b>repeatedly
    that the evidence on one set of charges must not be considered in relation
    to the other set of charges, he did not warn the jury against impermissible
    propensity reasoning.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[159]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R.
      v. Samkov</i>, [2008] O.J. No. 1005 (C.A.), this court decided that a trial
      judge, having refused severance in a case where evidence on each count
      was not admissible as similar fact evidence on each of the other counts,
      must give the jury a strong limiting instruction that includes a warning
      against impermissible propensity reasoning. In concluding a new trial was
      necessary, this court explained at para. 5:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In his instructions to the jury, the trial judge
    did segregate the evidence on each count but he made no reference to the
    use of evidence on one count in relation to any of the other counts. <u>Nor
    did the trial judge instruct the jury that it was not to use the evidence
    on one count to infer that the appellant was the type of person whose character
    or disposition was such that he was likely to have committed the offences
    charged on the other counts.</u> In our view, the absence of a proper limiting
    instruction was prejudicial to the appellant and the trial judge erred by
    failing to give such an instruction…. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[160]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Likewise,
    in this case, the trial judge failed to specifically caution the jury against
    the impermissible chains of the reasoning that the Supreme Court identified
    in <i>R. v. Arp </i>(1998), 129 C.C.C. (3d) 321 (S.C.C.): first, that they
    must not find that the accused is a bad person and convict him on that basis;
    and second, that they must not convict the accused as punishment for what
    he may have done in the past. In addition, he should have charged them that
    they should not use the testimony of one complainant to bolster the credibility
    of the other. In the absence of such instructions to the jury, I would find
    that the severance ruling resulted in an injustice to the appellant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[161]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Second,
    the trial judge, having decided the evidence that the appellant was in possession
    of a gun on unrelated occasions was admissible on the counts relating to
    S.M. and having decided not to sever the S.M counts from the M.A., should
    have given a strong propensity instruction about that evidence on the M.A.
    counts. Instead he compounded the prejudice to the appellant by mistakenly
    tying the evidence that he possessed a gun to the M.A. counts in his charge
    to the jury.  While the jury might have understood that he confused the two
    cases and misspoke, his comment may have undermined his caution that the
    jury consider the evidence related to the two sets of counts separately.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[162]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    view of my conclusion on the severance issue, I find it unnecessary to deal

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[163]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
