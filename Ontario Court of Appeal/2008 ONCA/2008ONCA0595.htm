  <h2>I.          Introduction</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    Crown appeal arises from a court-ordered stay of the prosecution of the respondent,
    Roger Dale Arcand, on various charges under the <i>Ontario Water Resources
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. O.40 (the Act) relating to the operation of the
    City of
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Brockville’s water pollution control plant in the late 1990s.  On December
    1, 2006, Waugh J. of the Ontario Court of Justice (the trial judge) ruled
    that the respondent’s rights under s. 7 of the <i>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i> had
    been violated as a result of prosecutorial misconduct.  He therefore stayed
    the proceedings as an abuse of process and awarded costs against the Crown.  The
    Crown’s appeal from that decision was dismissed by Power J. of the Superior
    Court of Justice (the appeal judge) on October 15, 2007.  The Crown now appeals
    to this court, with leave under s. 131 of the <i>Provincial Offences Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. P. 33 granted by Rosenberg J.A. on December 11, 2007.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal and order a new trial.  In
    my view, the trial judge’s finding of prosecutorial misconduct sufficient
    to warrant a stay of proceedings and his costs award are unsustainable.  Accordingly,
    the appeal judge erred by upholding the trial judge’s decision and a new
    trial is required.      </p>
  <h2>II.        Background Facts</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    procedural history of this case is complicated and includes a previous appeal
    to this court.  The pertinent chronology of events is as follows.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Commencing
    in January 2000, the City of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Brockville undertook an internal investigation into the operation of its
    water pollution control plant after receiving information suggesting that
    water quality and performance test results at the plant had been routinely
    altered to eliminate results that did not comply with regulatory requirements
    set by the Ontario Ministry of Environment (the MOE).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent was the superintendent of the plant.  The City suspended his employment
    in mid-February 2000 and eventually terminated it on May 2, 2000.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    City provided the results of its investigation to the MOE, thereby triggering
    a Ministry investigation.  On December 5, 2000, the City pleaded guilty to
    two counts under the Act concerning the discharge of effluent into the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    St. Lawrence River and the operation of the plant.  Following a joint submission
    on penalty, the City was fined $50,000 in respect of the first count and
    received a suspended sentence in respect of the second.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    February 2, 2001, the respondent was charged with seven counts under the
    Act.  During the subsequent proceedings in Provincial Offences Court, the
    defence raised concerns regarding the adequacy of Crown disclosure and sought
    particulars of the offences charged.  Some particulars were ordered and,
    by September 26, 2001, had been provided to the defence.  The trial was set
    for the weeks of February 4 and 11, 2002.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    December 20, 2001, the Crown successfully moved to amend the information
    against the respondent, allegedly to reflect the particulars provided, by
    adding twenty-six further counts under the Act (the Additional Charges).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the result, thirty-three counts were laid against the respondent for offences
    allegedly committed during the period January 10, 1996 to July 12, 2000.  The
    counts consisted of: (i) one count of discharging a material that might impair
    water quality; (ii) twenty-eight counts of submitting false or misleading
    information to the MOE regarding the operation of the plant; and (iii) four
    counts of failing to comply with the Municipal Sewage Works Certificate of
    Approval issued in respect of the plant.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown’s theory was that the respondent had altered numerous reports of test
    results to indicate that the operation and performance of the plant were
    in compliance with MOE requirements when the actual test results revealed
    a chronic state of non-compliance.  In an agreed statement of facts filed
    in the proceedings against the City, the Crown and the City agreed that:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A pattern of historic non-compliance and deception
    was identified during the investigation.  This deception took many forms,
    including tampering with samples, selective sampling practices, the pre-screening
    of samples for compliance, and the alteration of <i>bona fide</i> analytical
    results to demonstrate a state of compliance when none existed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    January 16, 2002, the respondent delivered a comprehensive disclosure request
    to the Crown.  Approximately nine days later, the Crown served the respondent
    with a notice of its intention to seek a custodial sentence in relation to
    one of the counts in the information.  </p>
  <h2>(1)       The First Trial</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    February 4, 2002, at the commencement of trial in the Provincial Offences
    Court, the Crown informed the court of the recent discovery of additional
    materials in the possession of a Crown witness, William Montgomery, the respondent’s
    former supervisor at the plant.  These new materials, contained in what the
    parties referred to as the
    “Montgomery Binder”, were first brought to the Crown’s attention shortly
    before trial when Mr. Montgomery began preparing for his trial testimony.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial was adjourned to permit the Crown to review the contents of the Montgomery
    Binder.  Thereafter, disclosure of most of the materials in the Montgomery
    Binder was made to the defence except for those documents over which the
    City asserted solicitor-client privilege.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    mid-May 2002, the Crown applied for an order removing the respondent’s lead
    trial counsel, Michael O’Shaughnessy, from the record on the basis of an
    alleged conflict of interest arising from the fact that Mr. O’Shaughnessy,
    while acting for the respondent, was also representing the respondent’s immediate
    subordinate at the plant (a proposed Crown witness in the prosecution against
    the respondent) in separate proceedings.  The Crown’s application was refused.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial recommenced on September 23, 2002.  At the opening of trial, the defence
    applied for an order requiring the Crown to disclose the documents in the
    Montgomery Binder that were subject to the City’s privilege claim.  The application
    was refused.  On October 1, 2002, the defence applied to the Superior Court
    of Justice for a writ of prohibition with <i>certiorari</i> in aid, on the
    ground that the Crown had breached its disclosure obligations.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    April 14, 2003, Quigley J. of the Superior Court of Justice granted the application
    and stayed all proceedings against the respondent.  He concluded that the
    Crown had failed to discharge its disclosure obligations, thereby compromising
    the respondent’s right to a fair trial.  On December 9, 2004, this court
    allowed a Crown appeal from that decision, set aside the stay of proceedings
    and remitted the case back to the Provincial Offences Court for a new trial: <i>R.
    v. Arcand</i> (2004), 192 C.C.C. (3d) 57 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).</p>
  <h2>(2)       The Second Trial</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown obtained an order transferring the second trial to the Ontario Court
    of Justice.  Pre-trial proceedings began on July 28, 2005 and a trial date
    was set for February 20, 2006. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    October 3, 2005, the trial judge heard a defence application for the production
    of twenty-two documents in the Montgomery Binder that the City claimed were
    privileged.  The trial judge reviewed the documents and all but ten of them
    were eventually produced to the respondent, either on consent or on the direction
    of the trial judge.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    the outset of trial on February 20, 2006, the defence applied for a stay
    of the Additional Charges, arguing that they were laid outside the two-year
    limitation period prescribed by the Act.  The Crown resisted the application,
    in part on the basis that the information against the respondent had merely
    been amended to ensure that the offences charged reflected the particulars
    provided to the respondent.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    next day, prior to releasing his ruling on the respondent’s stay application,
    the trial judge held an in chambers meeting with counsel, in the presence
    of a court reporter.  During the meeting, the trial judge sought clarification
    of some of the procedural steps in the case and, based on his review of the
    record, expressed concerns regarding the Additional Charges.  He inquired
    of defence counsel whether, given the record, it was a “feasible position”,
    or arguable, that the Crown had added the Additional Charges “almost as a
    punishment” for the earlier defence request for particulars.  The trial judge
    then indicated that he would “entertain a motion to throw the whole thing
    out on the basis of abuse of process” and stated:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Now, as I said, I would be totally open to that
    motion and I’ll be listening to submissions on both sides. … I’ll listen
    very closely and very attentively to a submission that the whole thing goes
    out the window because you cannot treat applications such as made by the
    defence here - - in some way deal with it as a punitive measure.  And I’m
    not saying that’s what happened, but I am troubled by the way - - the appearance
    of that.  And so I would entertain such a motion if defence wishes to bring
    it now or at a later date…</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Two
    events then occurred.  First, based on the above-quoted comments, the Crown
    requested that the trial judge recuse himself because of an alleged appearance
    of judicial bias.  The trial judge declined to do so.  Second, the defence
    withdrew its application to stay the Additional Charges and, on the basis
    of alleged prosecutorial misconduct, instead applied for an order under s.
    24(1) of the <i>Charter</i> quashing or staying the entire proceedings as
    an abuse of process and awarding costs against the Crown.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Affidavit
    evidence was filed and oral testimony from four witnesses was heard on the
    stay application.  The witnesses included Mr. O’Shaughnessy and the Crown
    prosecutor who had been involved in responding to the defence requests for
    disclosure and particulars and in amending the information against the respondent.  Mr.
    O’Shaughnessy alleged in his evidence, among other matters, that the Crown
    conduct complained of was a form of retaliation for his “diligent pursuit” of
    the case and his “vigorous” requests for particulars and disclosure on behalf
    of the respondent.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    December 1, 2006, the trial judge ruled that the conduct of the Crown was “so
    egregious” that to proceed with the prosecution “would be offensive to society’s
    sense of justice”.  In his opinion, the Crown’s “gross misconduct” constituted “unfairness
    and vexatiousness” of such a degree that it contravened fundamental notions
    of justice, undermined the integrity of the judicial process, and resulted
    in a “wanton violation” of the respondent’s <i>Charter</i> s. 7 rights.  Accordingly,
    the trial judge stayed the proceedings and awarded costs against the Crown
    in an amount not to exceed $50,000, to be fixed by an assessment officer.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    October 15, 2007, the appeal judge dismissed the Crown’s appeal from the
    trial judge’s decision.</p>
  <h2>III.       Issues</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The

  <h2>IV.       Analysis</h2>
  <h2><span>            </span>(1)       The Finding of Prosecutorial Misconduct</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    order of the stay and costs against the Crown was rooted in the trial judge’s
    finding of prosecutorial misconduct sufficient to constitute an abuse of
    process and a breach of the respondent’s <i>Charter</i> s. 7 rights.  Accordingly,
    the controlling issue on this appeal is whether this finding is sustainable.  The
    Crown submits, on various grounds, that it is not.  In particular, it contends
    that the record reveals reasonable explanations or justification for the
    impugned Crown conduct.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    conclude that the trial judge’s finding of serious prosecutorial misconduct
    is tainted by palpable and overriding error.  Consequently, the appeal judge
    erred by upholding it and the stay order and costs award that flowed from
    it.  I reach this conclusion for the following reasons.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge relied on several factors in holding that the Crown had engaged
    in prosecutorial misconduct sufficient to warrant a stay of proceedings,
    including: (i) the manner in which the Crown handled defence requests for
    disclosure and particulars throughout the prosecution; (ii) the Crown’s amendment
    of the information to add the Additional Charges; (iii) the Crown’s treatment
    of the City, in contrast to its treatment of the respondent; (iv) the Crown’s
    delivery of a notice of intention to seek a custodial sentence in respect
    of one of the counts against the respondent; and (v) the Crown’s unsuccessful
    application for an order removing Mr. O’Shaughnessy from the record.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is unnecessary for the disposition of this appeal to address all the factors
    cited by the trial judge.  As the following considerations demonstrate, when
    viewed in the context of the full record, many of these factors do not support
    the trial judge’s finding of prosecutorial misconduct.  </p>
  <h2>(i)        Disclosure and Particulars</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Both
    the trial and the appeal judge failed to consider that many of the actions
    of the Crown attacked by the respondent were sanctioned or authorized by
    the court.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    example, the trial judge was highly critical of the Crown’s approach to disclosure
    (especially in relation to the Montgomery Binder) and of its response to
    the defence request for particulars.  He termed the Crown’s approach to disclosure “less
    than satisfactory” and suggested that, prior to the second trial, it reflected
    “almost [a] total lack of adherence to the spirit of the disclosure requirements
    in <i>R. v. Stinchcombe</i><a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a> ”.  The trial judge described the Crown’s response
    to the defence request for particulars as “high-handed, if not insulting”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>But
    in <i>R. v. Arcand, supra</i> this court expressly addressed the respondent’s
    complaints about the Crown’s disclosure of the contents of the Montgomery
    Binder.  Justice Rosenberg, writing for the court, stated at paras. 18-20:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[T]he respondent had known since February 2002 that
    the City was claiming privilege over some of the documents and that these
    documents were not being disclosed.  Thus, since February 2002, the respondent
    has had time to take steps to obtain production of those documents.  Instead,
    he did nothing and maintained his position that the prosecution was required
    to disclose documents that it did not have in its possession.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:
center'>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Since the documents were not in the possession of
    the Crown, some procedure similar to the <i>O’Connor</i> procedure would
    have been the proper way for the defence to have sought their production.  [See <i>R.
    v. O’Connor</i> (1995), 103 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.).]</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The Crown could not disclose what it did not have.  The
    documents were not in the Crown’s possession.  Mr. Rickey [the MOE investigator]
    acted reasonably and responsibly to ensure continuity of the documents while
    at the same time respecting the City’s assertion of privilege.  The City’s
    own investigation may have led to the charges being laid against the respondent
    and it appears that the City was co-operating with the Ministry.  But, that
    did not make the City an arm of the Crown, so that any document in the possession
    of the City became subject to the Crown’s disclosure obligations.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge did not refer to Rosenberg J.A.’s comments in his reasons.  And
    while the appeal judge did mention some of them, he nonetheless failed to
    analyze the trial judge’s criticisms of the Crown in light of these comments.  Instead,
    the appeal judge merely stated: “[T]he circumstances before [the trial judge]
    had changed from what they were when the Court of Appeal dealt with this
    case.”  He provided no explanation of the basis for this conclusion.  Later
    in his reasons, when he returned to the issue of Crown disclosure, the appeal
    judge said only that he did not accept the Crown’s submission that the trial
    judge’s decision contradicted this court’s decision in <i>R. v. Arcand</i> and
    that: “In fact, the accused, following the decision of the Court of Appeal,
    sought the trial court’s assistance in obtaining further disclosure and documentary
    production.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    contents of the Montgomery Binder were provided to the defence several years
    prior to the second trial, save only for those documents in respect of which
    the City continued to assert a privilege claim.  Production of the privileged
    documents was the subject of an <i>O’Connor</i> application before the trial
    judge.  Ultimately, after the City substantially narrowed the scope of its
    privilege claim, production was made of all but ten of the third party documents
    at issue.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus,
    production of that part of the Montgomery Binder that remained controversial
    by the time of the second trial was dealt with in accordance with this court’s
    reasons in <i>R. v. Arcand, supra</i>.  This cannot ground a finding of prosecutorial
    misconduct or abuse of process.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent submits that, apart from the dispute concerning the Montgomery
    Binder, the Crown’s allegedly improper approach to disclosure was also evident
    from the way in which it responded to a defence request for disclosure of
    the original tape and tape recorder used during an interview of the respondent
    by a City investigator. When the defence raised concerns about the integrity
    of the tape, the Crown initially maintained that it was not obliged to disclose
    either the tape or the recording machine because they were in the investigator’s
    possession.  Subsequently, the Crown informed the defence that the tape and
    machine should be sought from the City investigator.  The trial judge viewed
    this Crown conduct as “totally unreasonable” in the circumstances and stated: “This
    attitude reflects the total lack of co-operation by the prosecution, which
    is seen in many other examples in the evidence.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    would have been preferable for the Crown to have facilitated the prompt provision
    of these items to the defence, given that the City investigator was a proposed
    Crown witness and the interview in question formed part of the Crown’s case
    against the respondent.  However, prior to the release of the trial judge’s
    ruling on the respondent’s <i>Charter</i> s. 7 application, a police analysis
    of the original tape (conducted on the consent of counsel) had confirmed
    the absence of any tampering with the tape.  Moreover, the defence was already
    in possession of a transcribed version of the interview in question.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Consequently,
    the question of the tape’s integrity was eventually resolved without prejudicing
    the respondent’s right to make full answer and defence.  In my opinion, while
    the investigation of the defence concern regarding the tape was scarcely
    timely, this incident falls far short of the type of egregious state conduct
    that would justify a stay of proceedings.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Likewise,
    the trial judge’s criticisms of the Crown’s response to the defence request
    for particulars suffer from similar defects.  The court had previously adjudicated
    the request and the particulars ordered were provided by September 26, 2001.  There
    is no suggestion that the Crown resisted any request for particulars thereafter,
    or that any other request for particulars was outstanding by the time of
    the second trial.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    his reasons, the trial judge questioned the propriety of certain statements
    allegedly made by the involved Crown prosecutor (not Crown counsel before
    the trial judge or this court) to defence counsel in response to the latter’s
    request for particulars.  The trial judge’s criticisms of these statements
    were well-placed.  Based on the record before this court, several of the
    alleged statements, at a minimum, were intemperate and uncivil.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>But
    for the purpose of this appeal, the important points are these.  First, even
    if the defence complaints about the Crown’s response to the request for particulars
    in the early stages of the prosecution were legitimate, they were resolved
    almost four years before the second trial.  Second, many of the particulars
    and some of the disclosure sought by the defence were denied by the court
    including, in respect of the contents of the Montgomery Binder, by the trial
    judge himself.  Accordingly, it appears that at least some of the requested
    particulars and disclosure were found by the court to be irrelevant, unnecessary,
    or subject to a legitimate privilege claim.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although
    the appeal judge described the positions of the parties on this issue in
    his reasons, he did not evaluate the trial judge’s highly critical findings
    about the Crown’s conduct regarding particulars in light of the record.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    summary, based on the appeal judge’s reasons, I am unable to conclude that
    he analyzed the trial judge’s findings about the Crown’s approach to disclosure
    and its response to the defence request for particulars in any meaningful
    way.  In particular, the appeal judge undertook no assessment of the Crown’s
    submission that the impugned findings were tainted by palpable and overriding
    error.  Yet these findings were an essential part of the trial judge’s reasoning
    in support of his holdings of prosecutorial misconduct and abuse of process.</p>
  <h2>(ii)      Additional Charges</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, the Crown’s decision to amend the information against the respondent
    to incorporate the Additional Charges also does not anchor a finding of prosecutorial
    misconduct or abuse of process.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge initially expressed concerns regarding this Crown decision during
    the meeting held in chambers on February 21, 2006.  At that time, no assertion
    of abuse of process had been made by the defence.  Subsequently, in his reasons
    in support of his stay decision, the trial judge questioned whether the amendment
    of the information to add the Additional Charges was “even necessary” and “why
    it was done with no advance notice to the defence”.  He eventually described
    the Additional Charges as “absolutely unnecessary”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    comparison of the seven counts initially laid against the respondent with
    the Additional Charges indicates that the Additional Charges do reflect detailed
    particulars of at least one of the original counts.  While it would have
    been advisable for the Crown to have provided the defence with timely notice
    of its intention to add the Additional Charges, the record indicates that
    the court permitted the amendment of the information without any objection
    by the defence.  In particular, at the time of the amendment, the defence
    raised no complaint of abuse of process.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    noting that the information was amended without any objection from the defence,
    the appeal judge stated: “In my opinion, it was not necessary to add the
    26 additional counts.”  Later, he added that he did not accept as “convincing” the
    Crown’s argument that it was necessary to add the Additional Charges and
    expressed the opinion that the trial judge had “properly dealt with this
    issue”.  Once again, the appeal judge provided no elucidation of the basis
    for these conclusory statements.  </p>
  <h2>(iii)     Treatment of the City and the Respondent </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge also relied in support of his finding of prosecutorial misconduct
    on what he perceived to be the Crown’s disparate treatment of the City in
    contrast to its treatment of the respondent with respect to the offences
    charged and the Crown’s position on penalty.  There are several difficulties
    with the trial judge’s use of this factor to bolster his finding of prosecutorial
    misconduct.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    the City’s position was materially different from that of the respondent.  The
    alleged infractions of the Act first came to light in the City’s own investigation,
    the results of which the City provided to the MOE.  The City co-operated
    fully with the ensuing MOE investigation and subsequently pleaded guilty
    to two counts under the Act.  Moreover, the charges against the City were
    based on vicarious liability, whereas the Crown alleged that the respondent
    was the primary offender.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus,
    both the City’s conduct and the basis for its legal exposure under the Act
    differed from that of the respondent.  Unlike the respondent, the City was
    entitled to sentence mitigation based on its co-operation with the MOE and
    its early guilty plea.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    the decision whether charges should be laid or continued against an accused
    is generally a matter for the prosecutorial authorities, not the courts.  (See
    for example, <i>R. v. V.T.</i> (1992), 71 C.C.C. (3d) 32 (S.C.C.)).  In the
    case at bar, the charges against the City and the Crown’s position on penalty
    in relation to those charges were the product of plea resolution negotiations
    and the exercise of prosecutorial discretion.  These are matters on which
    the courts should be hesitant to second-guess prosecutors.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third,
    the City’s guilty plea served a saluatory public purpose.  As the trial judge
    noted, “[A]s a result of the City’s plea of guilt to two related charges
    the public has had an insight into the difficulties with the Brockville Water
    Pollution Control Plant and can now be assured that steps were taken to rectify
    any difficulties.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    the prosecutor involved in the City’s sentencing hearing testified on the
    stay application.  He outlined the various considerations that led to the
    joint penalty submission.  While another prosecutor might have approached
    the issue differently, this does not render the offences actually charged,
    or the Crown’s position on penalty in respect of the City, objectionable
    or abusive.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    all these circumstances, neither the fact of different charges against the
    City and the respondent, nor the potential for different penalties, supports
    a finding of prosecutorial misconduct or abuse of process.  Although the
    appeal judge adverted to this issue in his reasons, he did not address the
    matter on the merits.</p>
  <h2>(iv)      Notice of Intention to Seek Imprisonment</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge held that it was “absolutely unnecessary” for the Crown to serve
    a notice of intention to seek the imprisonment of the respondent because
    he was already subject to potential jail sentences on some of the offences
    charged.  In the trial judge’s view, the fact and timing of the delivery
    of the notice lent further support to a finding of prosecutorial misconduct
    and, hence, abuse of process.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>With
    respect, I disagree.  The notice in question related to conduct that allegedly
    occurred at a time when the Act obliged the Crown to provide notice if it
    intended to seek a term of imprisonment.  The lead MOE investigator testified
    on the stay application that the impugned notice was delivered to preserve
    the prosecution’s option to seek such a penalty if the respondent was convicted
    on the count in question.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    the Crown submitted before this court, the prosecution had no way of knowing
    on which counts the respondent might ultimately be convicted.  The fact that
    the respondent faced potential jail sentences on some counts did not render
    improper the Crown’s right to seek a sentence of imprisonment on different
    counts.  As the Crown argued, service of the challenged notice did not oblige
    the Crown to seek a custodial sentence in respect of the count to which the
    notice related.  Rather, it simply made it possible for the Crown to do so,
    if the circumstances so warranted.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Once
    again, although the appeal judge outlined the trial judge’s findings concerning
    the challenged notice, he failed to scrutinize those findings in light of
    the record and the submissions of counsel.  Rather, he appears to have simply
    accepted the trial judge’s findings without any examination of the Crown’s
    claim that they were tainted by legal error.</p>
  <h2><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(v)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Conclusion
    Concerning Factors </h2>
  <h2>Cited by Trial Judge</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is well-established that a trial judge’s factual findings attract great deference
    from a reviewing court.  See <i>Housen v. Nikolaisen</i>, [2002] 2 S.C.R.
    235.  This deferential approach applies with equal force in constitutional
    infringement cases.  See <i>R. v. Chaisson </i>(2006), 206 C.C.C. (3d) 1
    (S.C.C.).  But this limitation on the permissible scope of appellate review
    is displaced where – as here – the factual findings or inferences drawn by
    a trial judge are tainted by palpable and overriding error.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this case, the trial judge’s finding of serious prosecutorial misconduct
    rested on several factors that do not withstand close scrutiny.  The considerations
    that I have outlined demonstrate that, when viewed in the context of the
    full record, many of the factors cited by the trial judge, either alone or
    in combination, do not support his finding of prosecutorial misconduct, let
    alone “gross” Crown misconduct.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    his part, the appeal judge failed to meaningfully scrutinize the factors
    used by the trial judge to support his finding of prosecutorial misconduct.  This
    was an error.  </p>
  <h2>(vi)      Other Considerations</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appeal judge’s decision is flawed for a second important reason.  He stated: “It
    seems to me that the trial judge concluded from a consideration of the entire
    history of the prosecution that it simply was not possible for the Court
    to guarantee a fair trial to the accused because of the conduct of the prosecution.”  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    the trial judge’s findings of prosecutorial misconduct and abuse of process
    were not based on trial fairness considerations.  The trial judge made no
    finding that the conduct of the prosecution prejudiced the respondent’s fair
    trial rights.  Rather, he held that the past conduct of the Crown was “so
    egregious that to go forward with this prosecution would be offensive to
    society’s sense of justice” and would “[undermine] the integrity of the justice
    system”.  This conclusion flowed from his earlier finding of serious prosecutorial
    misconduct sufficient to constitute a <i>Charter</i> s. 7 breach.  I have
    already concluded that this central finding is unsustainable. </p>

    would add one further observation.  In support of its request for a stay,
    the defence filed affidavit materials sworn by Mr. O’Shaughnessy in which
    Mr. O’Shaughnessy asserted that many of the Crown’s impugned actions were
    undertaken in retaliation for the vigorous defence mounted on behalf of the
    respondent.  In his oral testimony on the stay application, Mr. O’Shaughnessy
    repeated, and amplified, this claim.  He also testified about his experiences
    and expectations as a senior defence counsel for the purpose of advancing
    the defence contention that the actions of some of the Crown prosecutors
    in this case departed from the reasonable standards of conduct required of
    Crown counsel.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge’s finding of prosecutorial misconduct rested, at least in part,
    on Mr. O’Shaughnessy’s evidence.  There appears to have been no objection
    by the Crown to the admission of this evidence, nor any motion by the Crown
    to strike any part of Mr. O’Shaughnessy’s affidavits.  Having reviewed Mr.
    O’Shaughnessy’s evidence, it is my opinion that much of it not only constituted
    inadmissible opinion evidence, but also amounted to unsupported speculation,
    innuendo and conjecture regarding the motivations and decisions of Crown
    counsel.  In these important respects, Mr. O’Shaughnessy’s evidence did not
    provide a proper foundation for a finding of prosecutorial misconduct.</p>
  <h2>(2)       The Stay</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    threshold for granting a stay of criminal proceedings is very high.  In <i>R.
    v. Leduc</i> (2003), 176 C.C.C. (3d) 321 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), leave to appeal to the S.C.C. refused, [2003] S.C.C.A. No. 411, this court
    stated at para. 99:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>But the Crown’s breach of its obligation to disclose
    does not automatically entitle an accused to a stay of proceedings under
    s. 24(1) of the <i>Charter</i>.  A stay is a drastic remedy, a remedy of
    last resort, to be granted only in the “clearest of cases”.  It should be
    granted only in those rare cases where compelling an accused to stand trial
    would violate those fundamental principles of justice that underlie the community’s
    sense of fair play and decency.  Or, in the words of L’Heureux-Dub<span
style='"Times New Roman"'>é</span> J. in <i>R. v. O’Connor</i>, [1995] 4 S.C.R.
    411 at 468, 103 C.C.C. (3d) 1: a stay should be granted only “where the prejudice
    to the accused’s right to make full answer and defence cannot be remedied
    or where irreparable prejudice would be caused to the integrity of the judicial
    system if the prosecution were continued.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus,
    a stay may be warranted to remedy unfairness to an individual resulting from
    state misconduct or, in a “residual” category of cases, where the conduct
    of the prosecution so contravenes notions of justice as to undermine the
    integrity of the judicial process.  See
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on"><i>Canada</i></st1:country-region>
    <i> (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Tobiass</i> (1997), 118
    C.C.C. (3d) 443 (S.C.C.).  A stay of proceedings in a case falling within
    the latter category, however, may be granted only where the impugned conduct
    shocks the conscience of the community and is so detrimental to the proper
    administration of justice that it warrants judicial intervention.  See for
    example, <i>R. v. Power</i> (1994), 89 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.) and <i>R. v.
    Regan</i> (2002), 161 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (S.C.C.).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this case, both the trial and appeal judges were alive to the applicable
    principles governing the determination of whether state misconduct amounts
    to an abuse of process warranting a stay of proceedings.  The trial judge
    concluded that this case fell within the “residual”
    category of cases in which a stay was warranted because, in his view, the
    continuation of the prosecution, in light of the “egregious” conduct by the
    Crown, would offend “society’s sense of justice” and “undermine the integrity
    of the judicial process”.  He made no finding that the respondent’s right
    to make full answer and defence was irreparably compromised.  Nor did I understand
    the respondent to so contend before this court.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge’s stay order was a discretionary order.  The appeal judge properly
    recognized that it was thus entitled to deference on appeal.  The appeal
    judge could interfere with the trial judge’s exercise of discretion only
    if: (i) the trial judge misdirected himself or (ii) the trial judge’s decision
    was “so clearly wrong as to amount to an injustice”.  See <i>Leduc, supra</i> at
    para. 139; and <i>Regan, supra</i> at para. 117.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appeal judge was satisfied that the trial judge had not misdirected himself.  Although
    he did not expressly address whether the stay was so clearly wrong as to
    amount to an injustice, the appeal judge did conclude that a stay was appropriate.  Thus,
    in effect, he held that there was no basis in this case for appellate interference
    with the stay order.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    disagree.  In my view, the trial judge did misdirect himself.  Moreover,
    his order is so clearly wrong that it does amount to an injustice.  I say
    this for three reasons.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    the only basis for the stay was the trial judge’s finding of serious prosecutorial
    misconduct.  However, as I have explained, the trial judge failed to take
    account of several important considerations that strongly undercut this finding.  As
    a result, his finding of prosecutorial misconduct cannot stand.  And because
    this finding cannot be sustained, the foundation for the stay also collapses.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    as the trial judge recognized, there is a societal interest in having allegations
    of criminal conduct tried on their merits.  See <i>R. v. Arcand, supra</i> at
    para. 24.  This factor informs the exercise of judicial discretion concerning
    the granting of a stay of criminal proceedings.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this case, I agree with Rosenberg J.A.’s observation in his reasons granting
    the Crown leave to appeal to this court that: “The due administration of
    justice is implicated when this type of case is not dealt with on the merits
    because of a misapprehension as to the effect of prosecutorial conduct.”  Far
    more serious Crown misconduct than that alleged in this case has been held
    not to warrant a stay of criminal proceedings.  See for example, <i>Regan,
    supra</i>; and <i>R. v. Latimer</i> (1997), 112 C.C.C. (3d) (S.C.C.). </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    in <i>Tobiass, supra</i> the Supreme Court of Canada cautioned that for a
    stay of proceedings to be appropriate in a case falling into the “residual” category,
    it must appear that the state misconduct at issue is likely to continue in
    the future, or that the carrying forward of the prosecution will offend society’s
    sense of justice.  In this case, the impugned Crown conduct took place, for
    the most part, during the first trial and prior to this court’s review of
    the stay granted in that trial.  By the time of the second trial, a new Crown
    prosecutor had carriage of the case.  There is no suggestion of any impropriety
    by him.  To the contrary, the trial judge indicated that the Crown conduct
    with which he was concerned was “<i>past</i> conduct” that took place prior
    to the involvement of the Crown counsel assigned to the second trial.  Nor
    is there any other basis on which to conclude that prosecutorial misconduct
    would occur in the second trial.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    all these circumstances, it cannot be said that the carrying forward of the
    prosecution against the respondent will “manifest, perpetuate or aggravate” a
    course of abusive conduct by the state so as to justify a stay of proceedings.  See <i>Tobiass,
    supra</i>.  With respect, to the extent that the appeal judge’s reasons may
    be read as suggesting to the contrary, I conclude that he erred.</p>
  <h2>(3)       The Costs Award</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>An
    award of costs in a criminal proceeding is a rare and exceptional remedy.  In
    this case, the trial judge granted this award because he concluded that: “[t]here
    was gross misconduct on the part of the authorities in charge of the prosecution” that
    amounted to “a marked and unacceptable departure from the reasonable standards
    expected of the prosecution”.  See <i>R. v. 974649 Ontario Inc.</i> (2001),
    159 C.C.C. (3d) 321 (S.C.C.) at 356; and <i>Leduc, supra</i> at paras. 157-160.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    in this case, absent proof of an abuse of process occasioned by prosecutorial
    misconduct, there was no basis for an adverse costs award against the Crown.  There
    is no suggestion that the costs award can be supported on any other ground.  Accordingly,
    if, as I conclude, the trial judge’s finding of prosecutorial misconduct
    must be set aside, it follows that the costs award against the Crown must
    also fall.  </p>
  <h2>V.        Disposition</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    the reasons given, I would allow the appeal and set aside the finding of
    prosecutorial misconduct, the stay of proceedings, and the costs award against
    the Crown.  I would also order a new trial in the Provincial Offences Court
    and, given the passage of time, direct that the new trial be expedited.</p>
