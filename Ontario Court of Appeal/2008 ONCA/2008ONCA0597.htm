  <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellants (“plaintiffs”) and the Law
    Foundation of Ontario seek leave to appeal from the costs orders of Justice
    Haines of the Superior Court of Justice in respect of several class action
    proceedings.  There are 42 motions for
    leave to appeal, which have been consolidated into a single proceeding in this
    court.  See Schedule A for a list of
    motions for leave to appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Some of the respondents (the insurers) seek
    costs orders in respect of substantive appeals that were rendered moot by this
    court’s decision in <i>David Polowin Real
    Estate Ltd. v. Dominion of Canada General Insurance Co.</i> (2005), 76 O.R.
    (3d) 161 (C.A.), in which the court overruled its previous decision in <i>McNaughton Automotive Ltd. v. Co-operators
    General Insurance Co.</i> (2001), 54 O.R. (3d) 704 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) (“<i>McNaughton</i> <i>I</i>”).  After oral argument, we received notification
    from counsel on behalf of a number of the defendant insurers that they were
    prepared to forego any claims for costs in respect of the appeals that had
    become moot.  All counsel received copies
    of this notification.  We have not been
    advised that any other defendant insurer takes a contrary position.  I therefore proceed on the basis that we need
    not deal further with the costs related to the substantive appeals.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The issue of costs in the <i>David Polowin Real Estate Ltd.</i> appeal remains outstanding and will
    be released separately.</p>
  <h2>PROCEDURAL HISTORY</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In June 2001, this court released its judgment
    in <i>McNaughton I, </i>which decided that
    the practice of automobile insurers charging a deductible on total loss claims,
    where the insurer took title to the salvage, breached s. 6(7) of O. Reg. 777/93
    of the <i>Insurance Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.
    I-8.  The <i>McNaughton I</i> judgment was the catalyst for proposed class actions
    in 37 different cases, which include the insurers in this proceeding.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Justice Haines (the “motions judge”) was
    designated as the case management judge for all 37 actions.  The respondent insurers brought several
    preliminary motions pursuant to rules 20 and 21 of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>.  Each of the representative plaintiffs brought motions for
    certification.  The motions judge case
    managed all of the actions for more than six years.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the motions pursuant to rules 20 and 21, the
    respondents submitted that:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the court had no jurisdiction over out-of-province

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the actions were filed too late since the
    limitation period was one year under statutory condition 9(4) of O.Reg. 777/93
    under the <i>Insurance Act</i>, and not six
    years pursuant to the <i>Limitations Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. L-15;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>“actual cash value” in statutory condition 6(7) of
    O.Reg. 777/93 under the <i>Insurance Act </i>had
    a different meaning from that submitted by the plaintiffs;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(iv)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>any plaintiff who was insured under an “Ontario
    Policy Change Form 43 Endorsement” had no cause of action;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(v)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>there was no reasonable cause of action relating

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(vi)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>there was no reasonable cause of action relating

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(vii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the defendant was not the proper representative

  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>The insurers succeeded on all of their

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the motions where the status of the named
    representative plaintiff was in issue, there were cross-motions by the
    plaintiffs to add or substitute another representative plaintiff.  The cross-motions were dismissed in <i>Giuliano v. Allstate Insurance Co.</i><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motions judge’s decisions on costs were
    limited to entitlement and scale.  The
    assessment in each action was adjourned to be considered at a future date when
    all issues related to entitlement and scale were resolved.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motions judge concluded that the costs of
    the various motions should be payable to the successful parties.  The costs awards were to be on a partial
    indemnity scale, except for the rule 20 motions where the defendant insurer
    showed that there was no genuine issue for trial relating to the limitation
    period and the plaintiffs had “persisted with unsubstantiated allegations of
    fraud, dishonesty and deceit”. In the latter cases, the costs award were to be
    on a substantial indemnity scale.</p>
  <h2>The Costs Decisions</h2>
  <h2>(a)       The
    January 19, 2005 Decision </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This decision addressed the issue of costs in
    numerous motions in 30 separate actions.  The Law Foundation was granted standing before the motions judge because
    it had provided financial support to the plaintiffs through the Class
    Proceedings Fund and, as a result, the insurers were entitled to apply to the
    Law Foundation’s board for the payment of any costs awarded to them.  The Law Foundation has also received standing
    in this court on the application for leave to appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Before the motions judge, the plaintiffs and the
    Law Foundation relied upon s. 31 of the <i>Class
    Proceedings Act, 1992</i>, S.O. 1992, c. 6 (the “CPA”), in support of their
    position that costs should be awarded in their favour.  Section 31(1) of the CPA provides:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In exercising its
    discretion with respect to costs under subsection 131(1) of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, the court may
    consider whether the class proceeding was a test case, raised a novel point of
    law or involved a matter of public interest.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for the plaintiffs and the Law
    Foundation submitted that <i>McNaughton I</i> was a test case and that because they had brought all of the actions then before
    the court under the same case management regime, these actions collectively
    constituted a test case for the purpose of s. 31(1) of the CPA.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for the plaintiffs and the Law
    Foundation further submitted that the various matters brought by the insurers

    motions raised novel points of law or engaged the public interest, the motions
    judge concluded that while the motions may have involved novel facts, they were
    decided using settled law.  He agreed
    that the interpretation of statutory condition s. 6(7) raised a novel issue
    concerning a matter of public interest.  However, he concluded that that issue had already been decided in <i>McNaughton</i> <i>I</i>.  The motions judge stated:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In my view, the issues
    addressed in the several generic motions before this court were all related to
    defining the class within these proceedings and as such did not impact anyone
    beyond the reach of these proceedings.  The interpretation of the subject statutory condition would obviously
    have an impact on the manner in which the insurers resolved total loss claims
    in the future, but that issue which was both novel and because of its impact on
    the practice of settling certain claims, a matter of public interest, was
    already resolved by <i>McNaughton</i>.</p>

    costs to the insurers on a partial indemnity scale, except in respect of the rule
    20 motions where the plaintiffs persisted with unsubstantiated allegations of
    fraud and similar conduct.  </p>
  <h2>(b)       The September 16, 2005

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This decision was a sequel to the decision of
    January 19, 2005.  It addressed the
    issues of costs relating to actions that the motions judge had dismissed in
    that earlier decision, but not specifically addressed in his reasons.  One action in particular requires mention
    here – <i>Japetco and Barash v. Allstate</i>.  </p>

    v. Allstate Insurance Co.</i>, it became apparent that Mr. Giuliano had a
    problem with his claim: he had, in fact, been reimbursed for his
    deductible.  When the defendant insurer
    moved for judgment, counsel for the plaintiff brought a motion to add Japetco
    Corporation and Cheryl Barash as plaintiffs.  Some seven months later, a separate action was commenced in the style of <i>Japetco and Barash v. Allstate</i>.  The plaintiffs in the second action were the
    same parties as the plaintiffs sought to add in the <i>Giuliano</i> action.  Ultimately,
    the motion judge declined to add Japetco and Barash as plaintiffs.  A motion to dismiss the second action as an
    abuse of process followed and was granted.  The motions judge concluded that there was no justification for the
    second action and ordered substantial indemnity costs in favour of the insurer.</p>

    that it was not an appropriate party to be certified as a representative
    defendant.   The insurer also moved for
    judgment on the ground that the plaintiff’s personal claim fell outside the
    limitation period.  The plaintiff brought
    a cross-motion under s. 38 of the <i>Trustee
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. T-23, to extend the limitation period.  This cross-motion was dismissed.  The action was dismissed because the
    plaintiff’s personal claim was caught by the limitation period and the
    defendant was not an appropriate party to be certified as a representative
    defendant.</p>

  <h2>ANALYSIS</h2>
  <h2>(i)        Did
    the motions judge fail to give proper consideration to the underlying goals of
    the CPA?</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for the plaintiffs and the Law
    Foundation submit that the CPA is remedial legislation that should be
    interpreted purposively to give effect to its underlying goals, including judicial
    economy, improved access to the courts and modification of behaviour of actual
    or potential wrong-doers.  Counsel relied
    on the following articulation of the goals of the CPA by McLachlin C.J.C. in <i>Hollick v.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Toronto (City)</i>, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 158 at
    para. 15:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The Act reflects an
    increasing recognition of the important advantages that the class action offers
    as a procedural tool.  As I discussed at
    some length in <i>Western Canadian Shopping
    Centres Inc.</i> (at paras. 27-29), class actions provide three important
    advantages over a multiplicity of individual suits.  First, by aggregating similar individual
    actions, class actions serve judicial economy by avoiding unnecessary
    duplication in fact-finding and legal analysis.  Second, by distributing fixed litigation costs among a large number of
    class members, class actions improve access to justice by making economical the
    prosecution of claims that any one class member would find too costly to
    prosecute on his or her own.  Third,
    class actions serve efficiency and justice by ensuring that actual and
    potential wrongdoers modify their behaviour to take full account of the harm
    they are causing, or might cause, to the public. … In my view, it is essential
    therefore that the courts not take an overly restrictive approach to the
    legislation, but rather interpret the Act in such a way that gives full effect
    to the benefits foreseen by the drafters.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The plaintiffs and the Law Foundation make the
    somewhat surprising submission in their consolidated factum that the motions
    judge’s reasons of January 19, 2005 “do not address in any way the underlying
    goals of the <i>Class Proceedings Act</i>.”  They further argue that the failure to
    address these underlying goals in determining entitlement and scale of costs
    constitutes a fundamental error in principle upon which this court should grant
    leave to appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I disagree.  Paragraph 3 of the motions judge’s reasons under the heading “General
    Principles of Costs in Class Proceedings” expressly states:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>One of the often cited
    goals of the <i>CPA</i> is to improve access
    to the courts so that certain claims may be asserted that might otherwise never
    be litigated because of, <i>inter alia</i>,
    the cost of litigation in relation to the value of the claim.  The plaintiffs contend that these actions
    would not be economically viable except in a class proceedings context.  They submit that these actions challenge an
    insurance industry practice where the amount in issue for any individual
    claimant is very modest and where there is an enormous disparity in the financial
    resources and sophistication of the defendants, in comparison to the members of
    the proposed plaintiff classes, a circumstance which, the plaintiff’s maintain,
    the <i>CPA</i> was specifically designed to
    address.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In my view, the above excerpt clearly indicates
    that the motions judge was aware of the underlying goals of the CPA and, in
    particular, the objects of access to justice and judicial economy.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for the plaintiffs and the Law
    Foundation make a further surprising submission in their factum as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It is submitted that
    Justice Haines erred in principle in considering that the underlying goals of
    the <i>Act</i> were not relevant to
    entitlement and scale and only relevant to quantum.  </p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>I see no basis whatever for the
    above submission.  At a minimum, it distorts
    the motions judge’s reasons.  In the
    following passage from para. 30 of his reasons of September 16, 2005, the
    motions judge makes clear that he regarded the CPA’s underlying goals as
    relevant not only to quantum, but also to entitlement and scale:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>During the course of
    argument with respect to these matters, counsel for the plaintiffs made further
    submissions relating to those principles on costs that apply specifically to
    class proceedings.  <u>I had considered
    and addressed those principles in my reasons of January 19, 2005</u> and see no
    reason to expand on those reasons at this time; although I indicated then and
    reiterate now that I will entertain further submissions from counsel on the
    extent, if any, the underlying goals of the <i>Class
    Proceedings Act, 1992</i> should impact the quantum of costs awarded. [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>The above excerpt expressly confirms
    that the motions judge, in his reasons of January 19, 2005, considered and
    addressed the relevance of the CPA’s underlying principles to entitlement and
    scale.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span

  <h2>(ii)      Did
    the motions judge fail to give proper consideration to the factors in s. 31(1)

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The plaintiffs and the Law Foundation concede that
    the motions judge, in his reasons, addressed the factors in s. 31(1) of the
    CPA.  However, they disagree with his
    conclusion that the various motions before him did not constitute a test case,
    did not raise novel points of law and did not involve matters of public
    interest.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Before addressing the motions judge’s assessment
    of the s. 31(1) factors, I note that the decision of how much weight to accord
    these factors is discretionary. The discretionary character of the decision is
    evident not only from the s. 31(1)’s reference to the court’s “discretion with
    respect to costs” under the <i>Courts of
    Justice Act</i>, but also from the second part of the provision: “the court <u>may</u> consider whether the class proceeding was a test case, raised a novel point of
    law or involved a matter of public interest” [emphasis added]. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The plaintiffs commenced all of these actions
    before the court after the court’s decision in <i>McNaughton I</i>, on the premise that this court had decided in their
    favour the interpretation of statutory condition 6(7).  There is no issue that <i>McNaughton I</i> was a test case.  As for the cases at bar, however, I agree with the motions judge when he
    accepted the insurers’ characterization of the preliminary motions in these
    cases:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The defendants contend
    that the preliminary motions relating to jurisdiction, the limitation period,
    the OPCF 43 endorsement, the meaning and application of “actual cash value” and
    the alternative pleadings in conversion and unjust enrichment may have involved
    novel facts but were resolved with the application of settled law.  I agree with this charac-terization of these
    issues.  I accept that the interpretation
    of the subject statutory condition represented a novel issue involving a matter
    of public interest and I indicated as much in my reasons for making no order as
    to costs in disposing of the original application on August 14, 2000.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I see no merit in the submissions of the
    plaintiffs and the Law Foundation that the various motions in issue here can be
    collectively characterized as a test case and that these motions raise novel
    points of law.  Apart from some motions
    that revisited the issue of the interpretation of statutory condition 6(7) (not
    the subject of this application), the issues raised by the remaining motions
    could fairly be described as typical of everyday civil litigation.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For similar reasons, I agree with the motions
    judge that the issues raised in the generic motions do not “impact anyone beyond
    the reach of these proceedings” and therefore do not engage the public interest
    in the broader sense meant by the CPA.</p>
  <h2>(iii)     Did the motions judge fail to give proper consideration to the
    factors in rule 57.01(1) of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>?</h2>

    Foundation listed the failure to consider properly the factors in rule 57.01(1)
    as a separate ground in support of their application for leave to appeal, there
    was very little elaboration of the issue in their factum.  In any event, I am unable to find anything in
    the reasons of the motions judge that runs afoul of rule 57.01(1).</p>
  <h2>(iv)      Did the motions judge err in awarding costs on a substantial

    that the motions judge erred in awarding costs on a substantial indemnity scale
    where the unproven allegation of fraudulent concealment was pleaded in relation
    to the running of the limitation period.  Unlawful concealment, they submit, is a form of equitable fraud, which
    is not the same as civil fraud.  They
    rely upon the classic definition of equitable fraud adopted by Dickson J. in <i>Guerin v. The Queen</i>, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 335
    at 390:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The fraudulent
    concealment necessary to toll or suspend the operation of the [limitation
    period] need not amount to deceit or common law fraud.  Equitable fraud, defined in <i>Kitchen v. Royal Air Force Association</i>,
    [1958] 1 W.L.R. 563, as “conduct which, having regard to some special
    relationship between the two parties concerned, is an unconscionable thing for
    the one to do towards the other”, is sufficient.</p>

    an unproven allegation of equitable fraud is not sufficient to attract an award
    of substantial indemnity costs.  In
    support of this submission, they cite three cases: <i>M. (K.) v. M. (H.)</i>, [1992] 3 S.C.R. 6 at paras. 63-65; <i>First City Capital Ltd. v. British Columbia
    Building Corp.</i>, [1989] B.C.J. No. 130 (S.C.); and <i>Georgialee Lang &amp; Associates v. Wigod</i>, [2003] B.C.J. No. 1792

    the Law Foundation.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the third case, <i>Georgialee Lang &amp; Associates</i>, the trial judge said at para. 49:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I find that neither the
    allegations of equitable fraud or negligence <u>in this case</u> justify an
    order for special costs.  A claim of
    equitable fraud falls short of deceit, and is distinct from an allegation of
    fraud: <i>First City Capital Ltd. v.

  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>As I read this passage, it does not
    say that unproven allegations of equitable fraud can never justify substantial
    indemnity costs, but only that substantial indemnity costs may not be justified

    submit that the plaintiffs did not plead fraud, fraudulent misrepresentation or
    deceit as causes of action against the insurers.  Their position is that the allegations the
    motions judge relied upon to support an award of substantial indemnity costs
    related to punitive damages claims that were not before the motions judge
    because the actions were dismissed at a preliminary stage.  </p>

    the limitation period included the following at para. 17:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The defendant breached
    the duty of good faith owed by the defendant, and its agents, servants and
    employees, to the class members, by:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(c)       orchestrating a claims adjustment process
    in a deliberate and planned fashion so as to deprive the class members, of
    payment for the actual cash value of their vehicle;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(d)       instructing its agents, servants and
    employees to embark upon a course of conduct designed to deprive the class
    members of their ownership rights in their damaged vehicles as described in a
    manual, or as part of their training;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(f)        deliberately and actively concealing from
    the class members, their right to demand payment of the actual cash value of
    their vehicle, or their right to retain property of their vehicle and salvage
    rights once the deductible was applied.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>In my view, the above allegations
    are tantamount to allegations of fraud, dishonesty and deceit.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In respect of punitive damages, the plaintiff in <i>Ross </i>pleaded at para. 20(a):</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The particulars of the
    conduct of the defendant relied upon by the plaintiff as supporting a
    substantial award of punitive damages are:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the defendant’s breach of its duty of utmost
    good faith to the class members as described in paragraphs 17(a) – (h) [dealing
    with discoverability and limitation periods] was highly reprehensible conduct
    that departs to a marked degree from ordinary standards of decent behaviour;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the defendant’s conduct was motivated by greed
    and resulted in the defendant accumulating substantial wealth and profit at the
    expense of the class members.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>The above allegations appear to
    relate not only to punitive damages but also to the breach of the duty of
    utmost good faith in respect of the limitation period, an issue that the
    motions judge resolved.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Hayner
    v. Trafalgar Insurance Co. of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    </i>,
    the plaintiff pleaded at para. 19:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Discoverability Doctrine</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>19.       The plaintiff and other class members had
    no means of knowing they were either entitled to the actual cash value of the
    motor vehicle that had been classified as a total loss, or the salvage from the
    sale of that motor vehicle.  Accordingly,
    no limitation period has begun to run.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>The above pleading does not allege
    the kind of conduct that, if unproven, would attract substantial indemnity
    costs.  In support of punitive damages,
    the plaintiff in <i>Hayner</i> pleaded as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Punitive Damages</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>25.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For commercial reasons of monetary gain, the
    defendant has engaged in a practice it knew or ought to have known was
    unlawful, and in breach of the Statutory Condition, and further in breach of
    its duty of utmost good faith to the plaintiff and other class members.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>26.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The defendant’s conduct was callous and
    high-handed, and took advantage of the ignorance and vulnerability of the
    plaintiff and other class members.  The
    plaintiff and other class members are therefore entitled to a substantial award
    of punitive damages.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Unlike the pleadings on punitive damages in <i>Ross</i>, these pleadings do not appear
    connected to the limitation period issue. Because the issue of punitive damages
    was not resolved before the motions judge, then, the above allegations, if
    unproven, would not attract a costs award on a substantial indemnity scale.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Shaw v.
    Zurich Canada</i>, under the heading “Concealment by Defendant Triggers
    Discoverability Doctrine”, the plaintiff pleaded:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>16.       The Class Members had no means of knowing
    what the defendant did with the vehicles or the amounts of the salvage unless
    advised by the defendant.  As a result of
    the defendant’s failure to reveal to the Class Members the aforesaid Statutory
    Condition, and the defendant’s <u>systematic concealment of the amount of the
    proceeds of the sale of the salvage</u>, the Class Members did not know they
    were entitled to the proceeds of the sale of the salvage.  Accordingly, no limitation period begins to
    run against the Class Members unless and until they learn whether their
    vehicles were salvaged, except in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Alberta
    where the applicable limitation period is 10 years.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>The allegation that the insurer
    engaged in the “systematic concealment of the amount of the proceeds of the
    sale of the salvage” is an allegation of an act of intentional dishonesty
    which, if unproven, may attract substantial indemnity costs.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Shaw</i>,
    the plaintiff’s allegations in support of an award of punitive damages are virtually
    identical to those contained in the statement of claim in <i>Hayner</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the fourth representative statement of claim, <i>Jory v. Primmum Insurance Co.</i>, the
    allegations in respect of the discoverability doctrine are identical to the
    allegations in <i>Shaw</i>.  In respect of punitive damages, the original
    allegations are virtually identical to those in both <i>Shaw </i>and <i>Hayner</i>.  However, the statement of claim was
    subsequently amended to add several further allegations concerning the callous
    and high-handed conduct on the part of the defendant insurer.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The above excerpts from the four representative
    statements of claim indicate that three of the four – <i>Ross</i>, <i>Shaw</i> and <i>Jory</i> – contain allegations of fraudulent
    or dishonest conduct that, in my view, are capable of attracting substantial
    indemnity costs if such allegations are unproven.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I now return to consider what the motions judge
    said about these allegations in respect of the scale of costs.  In his reasons of January 19, 2005, he
    referred to the judgment of R.A. Blair, J. in <i>131843 Canada Inc. v. Double “R” (Toronto) Ltd.</i> (1992), 7 C.P.C.
    (3d) 15 (Ont. Gen. Div.), for the proposition that only exceptional cases
    attract substantial indemnity costs.  Along
    these lines, the motions judge also cited this court’s judgment in <i>Murano v. Bank of Montreal</i> (1998), 41
    O.R. (3d) 222 at 243-44 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).
    The motions judge was thus alive to the exceptional nature of substantial
    indemnity costs.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motions judge concluded his reasons on this
    issue as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Counsel for the
    plaintiffs and the Law Foundation of Ontario contend that there are no special
    circumstances in these cases that warrant an award of costs on a substantial
    indemnity scale.  They maintain that the
    allegations in the pleadings raise the issue of unlawful concealment, which is
    essentially an allegation of unconscionability or equitable fraud that engages
    the issue of discoverability.  There is
    no doubt that the conduct pleaded would, if established, give rise to a finding
    of fraudulent concealment but, in my view, the allegations go well beyond
    that.  It is apparent from reading the
    pleadings that the allegations are intended to identify dishonest conduct that,
    if proven, would likely attract an award of punitive damages.  It is accepted that class proceedings are, in
    many respects, different from other litigation and that the courts have been
    cautious in their approach to costs in such proceedings in order to avoid
    stifling the objectives of the <i>CPA</i>,
    but proceeding under the <i>CPA</i> should
    not confer immunity from costs sanctions designed to discourage unacceptable
    practices.  <u>Therefore, I can see no
    reason why I should not award substantial indemnity costs on the motions for
    judgment in the actions where the claims of the proposed representative
    plaintiffs fell outside the one year limitation period and those plaintiffs
    persisted with unsubstantiated allegations of fraud, dishonesty and deceit in
    an effort to establish fraudulent concealment in order to extend the limitation
    period to include their claims.</u></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In the end, it is my
    opinion that the costs on all of the motions in these actions should be payable
    to the successful party on a partial indemnity scale except for the r. 20
    motions where the defendants demonstrated there was no genuine issue for trial
    relating to the limitation period.  On
    those motions, the defendants will be entitled to their costs on a substantial
    indemnity scale.  Counsel should contact
    the trial co-ordinator at
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    London
    to arrange for an appointment for me to fix those costs.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>                                                                        [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Based on a review of the four representative
    statements of claim, not every statement of claim that raises the
    discoverability issue is supported by allegations of fraud, dishonesty or
    deceit.  However, the last sentence of
    the first paragraph of the above excerpt from the motions judge’s reasons
    suggests that the motions judge intended to confine substantial indemnity costs
    to the those cases where the limitation period was in issue and the “plaintiffs
    persisted with unsubstantiated allegations of fraud, dishonesty and deceit in
    an effort to establish fraudulent concealment”. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While it is true that the second paragraph of
    the above excerpt from the motions judge’s reasons, if read by itself, suggests
    that substantial indemnity costs apply to every case where the limitation defence
    succeeded, I do not believe that is what the motions judge intended.  For example, as indicated above, <i>Hayner</i> would not be an appropriate case
    for substantial indemnity costs.  In any
    event, determining which limitations claims involved allegations of fraud,
    dishonesty and deceit will be easily clarified when the motions judge proceeds
    to the assessment of the quantum in each of these cases.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While the allegations of fraud and improper
    conduct solely in support of punitive damages appear to be extreme, and would
    probably not have succeeded had the actions proceeded to trial, I do not
    believe that they can support an award of substantial indemnity costs since the
    issue of punitive damages was never resolved.</p>
  <h2>(v)       Did
    the motions judge err in awarding costs on a substantial indemnity scale in <i>Japetco
    and Barash v. Allstate</i>?</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For convenience, I restate the relevant facts of <i>Japetco and Barash</i>.  In the first action commenced against
    Allstate, Mr. Giuliano was named as the representative plaintiff.  It was later discovered that Mr. Giuliano had
    in fact been reimbursed for his deductible.  Counsel for the plaintiffs moved to substitute Japetco Corporation and
    Cheryl Barash as representative plaintiffs.  Before the return of that motion, counsel for the plaintiffs commenced a
    second action in the names of Japetco Corporation and Ms. Barash against
    Allstate.  That action was eventually
    dismissed.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for the appellants submits that the motions
    judge erred in awarding costs on a substantial indemnity scale in respect of
    the second action because that action was commenced out of an abundance of
    caution to protect the class in the event that the motion to substitute was
    denied.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In para. 28 of his September 16, 2005 reasons
    for decision, the motions judge said: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In my view, there was no
    justification for the commencement of the <i>Japetco
    and Barash</i> action.   In doing so, the
    plaintiffs created a duplicate proceeding to which the defendant was forced to
    respond.  In such circumstances, I
    consider such conduct scandalous and conclude that the defendant is entitled to
    recover its substantial indemnity costs in this action.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I can find no reason to disagree with the motions
    judge.</p>
  <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In my view, there are not strong grounds upon
    which to grant leave to appeal in this case.  The motions judge was clearly entitled to exercise his discretion by
    awarding costs to the successful parties on the motions before him.  I can find nothing in the CPA, the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i> or the case law
    to suggest otherwise. Further, it was within the motions judge’s discretion to
    award substantial indemnity costs in the cases he deemed appropriate.  In respect of the alleged grounds of appeal,
    and the errors said to be made by the motions judge, I find that they are
    without merit.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[66]<span
