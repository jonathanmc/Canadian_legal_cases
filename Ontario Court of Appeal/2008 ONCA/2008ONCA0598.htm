style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant, Duncan Hobbs, appeals the
    following two orders of Justice Sproat of the Superior Court of Justice: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>an order dated November 27, 2007 finding him in
    contempt of court concerning his failure to make production of documents in
    this family law pro-ceeding;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>an order dated January 25, 2008 awarding full indemnity
    costs in the amount of $26,572.17 in favour of the respondent, Carol Rose Hobbs
    and dismissing his motion to find Ms. Hobbs in contempt of court for failure to
    provide documentation and information concerning RBC bank account number 5125232.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Carol Hobbs and Duncan Hobbs were married on
    January 12, 1980.  They separated in the
    spring of 2005.  There are two adult children
    of the marriage who at the time of these proceedings were engaged in
    educational pursuits.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>These proceedings were commenced in April
    2006.  The main issues concern child
    support, spousal support and the equalization of property.  The matters that are in dispute in these
    appeals arise out of the parties’ respective obligations to produce financial
    information.  </p>
  <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Hobbs is the sole shareholder of Basil D.
    Hobbs Inc., a family holding company.  Basil D. Hobbs Inc. owns 30% of Charton-Hobbs Inc.  The remaining 70% of Charton-Hobbs Inc. is
    owned by Jean Charton.  Charton-Hobbs
    Inc. is engaged in the wine importation and distribution business.  Mr. Hobbs is employed by Charton-Hobbs Inc.  In 2006, his annual income is admitted to be
    $466,598.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Issues concerning the valuation of Mr. Hobbs’s
    corporate interests and his annual income surfaced early in the
    litigation.  Ms. Hobbs brought a motion
    on February 13, 2007 before Sproat J. seeking the production of documents and
    information set out in a letter from her expert valuator, Wayne Rudson, dated
    August 10, 2006.  The motion judge made
    the order requested as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>That paragraph 2 of the notice of motion is
    granted, and Order to go mandating the Respondent to co-operate in all respects
    with respect to the disclosure requests of the Wife’s former valuator, Wayne B.
    Rudson of Rudson Valuation Group Inc., made in his correspondence dated August
    10, 2006, and as more particularly set out in his Schedule of Information
    Required, (Applicant’s C.R., Part 2., Part 2, Vol. 1 Tab 6(P)).  These disclosure requests are to be answered
    within 30 days of the date of this Order, and to the extent that they are not
    answered, Mr. Hobbs is required to provide a detailed explanation for why they
    have not been answered, also within 30 days of the date of this Order.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>That the Respondent shall permit access by the
    Wife’s current business valuator, Mr. Andrew J. Freedman of Cole &amp;
    Partners, and shall facilitate all aspects of the disclosure process, and such
    inquiries as Mr. Freedman may have arising out of the Horsley &amp; Associates
    Report, when finally produced.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On April 16, 2007, the parties were back before
    the motion judge on a number of issues including Mr. Hobbs’ lack of financial
    disclosure.  Counsel for Mr. Hobbs
    advised the court that her client had been travelling almost constantly for two
    months and that she had not had an opportunity to review some of the
    information with him.  The motion judge
    rejected this explanation.  His
    endorsement in this respect reads:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[11]     This is unacceptable.  I realize litigants cannot be expected to
    give up their day jobs to attend to litigation matters.  On the other hand, court orders must be
    followed.  Ms. Brown advises Mr. Hobbs’s
    travel schedule is somewhat cyclical and that he will be spending more time in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  If Mr. Hobbs believes any future travel
    commitments will interfere with his ability to comply with court ordered
    disclosure he should cancel them now.  If
    he is in contempt of any further orders due to travel issues he may be ordered
    to surrender his passport until he purges his contempt.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[12]     Ms. Brown asked for three weeks to review
    the Rudson requests with Mr. Hobbs.  In
    effect this asks me to continue this aspect of the motion if Mr. Hobbs decides
    to raise some objection.  This I am not
    prepared to do.  I am deciding this
    motion on the material before me.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[13]     All of the information requested by Rudson
    appears relevant and shall be produced to the extent it is in Mr. Hobbs’s power
    or available to him on request as specified in Rule 19(1)(b).</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>The formal order of April 26, 2007 included
    not only the information requested by Mr. Rudson but also further information
    requested by Ms. Hobbs’ newly-retained valuator, Andrew J. Freedman.  The order provided at para. 5:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>All of the information
    requested by Rudson and Freedman, appears relevant and shall be produced to the
    extent it is in Mr. Hobbs’s power or available to him on request as specified
    in Rule 19(1)(b).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Rule 19(1)(a) and (b) of the <i>Family Law Rules</i> provide:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>19. (1) Every party
    shall, within 10 days after another party’s request, give the other party an
    affidavit listing every document that is,</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>relevant to any issue in the case; and</p>

    party on request.</p>
  <h2>MS. HOBBS’S CONTEMPT MOTION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On September 7, 2007, counsel for Ms. Hobbs
    launched a motion against Mr. Hobbs for contempt of the court orders dated
    February 13, 2007 and April 26, 2007 on the ground that Mr. Hobbs had failed to
    make full financial disclosure as required by these orders.  Counsel for Ms.
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Hobbs filed affidavit material that detailed
    the allegations of deficient disclosure.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for Mr. Hobbs was made aware on or about
    September 13, 2007 that a contempt motion was proceeding against her
    client.  In the next two weeks, counsel
    for Mr.
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Hobbs
    sent approximately seventeen letters to counsel for Ms. Hobbs forwarding
    disclosure material.  During the period
    October 4 to October 16, 2007, approximately twenty-three further letters were
    sent by counsel for Mr. Hobbs enclosing additional disclosure material.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Hobbs responded to the contempt motion by
    filing two affidavits.  His counsel also
    filed two affidavits deposed by her assistant, Diana Mares.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms. Hobbs relied upon a letter addressed to her
    counsel dated August 13, 2007 from Mr. Freedman detailing the alleged
    deficiencies in Mr. Hobbs’ disclosure which had been requested in Mr.
    Freedman’s prior letter of April 10, 2007.  Mr. Freedman’s August letter read in part:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>On April 10, 2007 we
    provided you with a letter setting out information and documents that we had
    requested in order for us to comment on the valuation of Mr. Hobbs’ business
    interests prepared by Mr. Horsley and to calculate Mr. Hobbs’ income for the
    purposes of determining support.  We have
    reviewed the correspondence and information provided to you by Constance Brown
    subsequent to this letter and have determined that only two of the outstanding
    requests have been provided.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>We are unable to
    understand why most of the information regarding the valuation of Basil D.
    Hobbs Inc. could not have been provided together as most of it is likely
    contained in Mr. Horsley’s files or easily accessible by him or Mr. Hobbs.  Our requests are routine for this type of
    matter and production of this information is critical to enable us to provide
    advice to Mrs. Hobbs and yourself.  We
    have requested the opportunity to meet with Mr. Hobbs directly, however, we
    require the requested disclosure so that our meeting will be productive.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Hobbs agreed that there was some delay in
    responding to the disclosure required by the order of April 26, 2007.  He said it was unintentional and that he had
    to obtain the corporate documents from the accountants, corporate lawyers and
    staff at Charton-Hobbs Inc. who did not always answer immediately.  He also deposed that his counsel had
    fractured her shoulder and elbow at the end of April 2007 and that she did not
    return to work full-time until August 1, 2007.  In addition, counsel’s assistant, who had been dealing with his file,
    had moved to
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    British Columbia
    in June 2007.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motion judge rejected Mr. Hobbs’s
    explanation for delay:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[27]     I do not accept these as any legitimate
    explanation or excuse.  If Mr. Hobbs had,
    with the assistance of the accountants, corporate lawyers and staff of Charton-Hobbs,
    obtained the documents that were required it would have been a simple matter
    for Ms. Brown to review the documents prior to delivery.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[28]     It is not necessary for me to make a
    determination as to Mr. Hobbs’s motives.  It does appear, however, that he perceives some tactical advantage in
    delaying Ms. Hobbs and running up her costs.  No doubt he is also influenced by the evident animosity between the
    parties.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Hobbs deposed that he reviewed the August
    13, 2007 deficiency letter of Mr. Freedman and concluded that it was full of
    inaccuracies.  He claimed that of the
    sixteen items in Mr. Freedman’s letter, eleven items were wrong.  The requests in those eleven items had been
    answered prior to August 2007.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On October 3, 2007, Mr. Freedman forwarded a
    letter to counsel for Ms. Hobbs in which he stated that the information contained
    in items 23 and 24 of the August 13, 2007 letter remained outstanding as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>23.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Details of any non-arms length or non-recurring

    Commerciale Ville-Marie Inc. for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2002
    through 2006.  Examples of some of these
    items would include legal fees with respect to litigation, tax reassessments,
    moving costs, large repairs to equipment or building, etc.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The response received as set out in
    Mr. Hobbs’ September 17, 2007 Affidavit is to “refer to the relevant financial
    statements”.  This is an incomplete

    Vice-President of Charton-Hobbs Inc., wrote to Mr. Hobbs by e-mail concerning
    the information contained in items 23 and 24 of the Freedman letter of August
    13, 2007:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>If you required further
    information, [i]t will take a lot of time to dig into each of these financial
    years and I will need assistance to define specifically what mean [<i>sic</i>] non-recurrent expenses.  Also [how] do they determined [<i>sic</i>] a minimum amount for a transaction
    to be consider [<i>sic</i>] important.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>For example, in our
    business we lose and gain new suppliers (our client).  When losing a suppliers [<i>sic</i>] we gain a compensation revenue and when we acquirer [<i>sic</i>] a new one we can contribute for a

    in an affidavit sworn November 9, 2007:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The items that we did
    have difficulty with, in Mr. Freedman’s disclosure requests, due to the sheer
    volume of pages and sometimes vagueness were #23 and #24.  To try and remedy the completion of the
    disclosure, Brigitte Lachance, a Chartered Accountant and Vice President
    offered to work with Mr. Freedman.  This
    offer was not acted upon.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Therefore, summaries
    were sent and then the huge documentation (over 1,000 pages for each year) for
    Promotion and Advertising were emailed directly to Mr. Freedman by Ms. Lachance
    to work with, as he saw fit, as Ms. Brown’s computer could not handle the sheer
    volume.</p>

    2007, there was still much work to be done to deal with this significant area

  <h2>THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL RELIED UPON
    BY MR. HOBBS CONCERNING HIS CONTEMPT</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Hobbs relied upon the following grounds of
    appeal concerning his contempt:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There was no precise date for Mr. Hobbs to
    complete the court-ordered disclosure.  The disclosure was completed prior to the contempt hearing.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The order of April 26, 2007 qualified the
    required disclosure “to the extent it is in Mr. Hobbs’s power”.  While third parties were co-operative, they
    were slow in providing disclosure documentation.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The illness of Mr. Hobbs’s counsel and the loss
    of the assistant working on the file were not the fault of Mr. Hobbs.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(iv)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motion judge misapprehended the evidence of
    Mr. Hobbs’s disclosure in September and October 2007 after the motion was
    proceeding.  The majority of the disclosure
    provided in that time included voluntary disclosure that was not ordered by the
    court.  The voluntary disclosure exceeded
    the court-ordered disclosure to such an extent that it caused a serious
    misapprehension of the evidence.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(v)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motion judge relied on the deficiency set
    out in the Freedman letter of August 13, 2007.  The letter was incorrect – eleven of the sixteen deficiencies referred
    to in the letter were simply wrong.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(vi)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motion judge erred in making a finding of
    contempt on the basis of conflicting affidavit evidence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I do not agree that there was no precise date
    for Mr. Hobbs to complete the court-ordered disclosure.  On the hearing of the motion in April 2007,
    counsel for Mr. Hobbs requested a three-week extension to review the
    outstanding disclosure with her client.  As
    indicated above, the motion judge refused this request and ordered production
    to proceed “as specified in Rule 19(1)(b)”.  Rule 19(1)(b) provides for a ten-day time period within which to provide
    an affidavit of documents in a party’s control or available to the party on
    request.  The motion judge intended Mr.
    Hobbs to comply with his order within ten days.  This order was not challenged by an application for leave to appeal or
    by appeal as counsel obviously thought her client could make disclosure within
    three weeks (twenty-one days).  She and
    Mr. Hobbs accepted that he would have to do it within ten days.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In respect of disclosure from third parties
    including Ms. Lachance, it is apparent that in respect of items 23 and 24 in the
    Freedman letter of August 13, 2007 little effort was made to obtain relevant documents
    and information until on or about October 1, 2007.  This was some five months after the order of
    April 26, 2007.  Items 23 and 24 were
    crucial to Ms. Hobbs and her counsel obtaining full financial disclosure from
    Mr. Hobbs.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motion judge rejected the illness of Mr.
    Hobbs’s counsel and the loss of her assistant as providing a reasonable excuse
    for the delay in dealing with the deficiencies in production.  Given Mr. Hobbs’s failure to initiate the
    production of significant corporate information from Ms. Lachance until the
    fall of 2007, I can find no palpable or overriding error with the motion
    judge’s apparent scepticism concerning his position.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I do not believe that the motion judge
    misapprehended the evidence of the September/October disclosure.  While Mr. Hobbs alleges that the majority of
    the disclosure was voluntary and unrelated to the disclosure mandated by the
    April 26, 2007 order, no details are provided.  Also, one does wonder why there would be a burst of production activity
    immediately following the launch of a contempt motion if it did not relate to
    the alleged deficiencies.  In any event,
    the motion judge emphasized in his reasons for costs dated January 25, 2008
    that “the contempt finding was based upon the court ordered disclosure.” </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In respect of Mr. Hobbs’s assertion that eleven
    of the sixteen deficiencies noted by Mr. Freedman were incorrect and had been
    answered prior to August 2007, even if this is correct, the lion’s share of the
    production requests would appear to be those contained in items 23 and 24 of
    the Freedman letter of August 13, 2007.  Those items were still outstanding as of October 1, 2007.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, Mr. Hobbs alleges that the motion judge
    erred in making a finding of contempt against him on the basis of conflicting
    affidavit evidence.  In my view, a complete
    answer to this alleged error is contained in the motion judge’s reasons where
    he says:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>At the outset of the
    hearing I enquired whether Mr. Hobbs was seeking a trial of the issue of
    contempt and to call <i>viva voce</i> evidence.  Ms. Brown advised that he was
    not and that Mr. Hobbs wished to proceed on the basis of the affidavit evidence
    before the Court.</p>

    ), Blair
    J.A. set out the test for a finding of contempt of court:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The criteria applicable
    to a contempt of court conclusion are settled law.  A three-pronged test is required.  First, the order that was breached must state
    clearly and unequivocally what should and should not be done.  Secondly, the party who disobeys the order
    must do so deliberately and wilfully.  Thirdly, the evidence must show contempt beyond a reasonable doubt.  Any doubt must clearly be resolved in favour
    of the person or entity alleged to have breached the order.  <i></i></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motion judge concluded his analysis of the
    evidence before him as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[30]     I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt
    that Mr. Hobbs has deliberately and wilfully disobeyed the Court order of April
    26, 2007 by failing in a timely manner to make the financial disclosure that
    was ordered.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[31]     The April 26, 2007 Endorsement was critical
    of Mr. Hobbs for having failed to comply with the February 13, 2007 order.  He was specifically alerted to his exposure
    to liability for contempt of court.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[32]     It would then have been a simple matter to
    convene a meeting including officials of Charton-Hobbs to review Mr. Freedman’s
    letter, line by line, and arrange for the documents that were readily available
    to be assembled and for other documents to be obtained.  Further, if there were any issues such as the
    proper definition of a non-recurring expense, this could have been raised with
    a view to agreeing upon a definition or they could have adopted a reasonable
    definition and so advised Ms. Hobbs.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I agree with the motion judge’s analysis.  The evidence before him satisfied the
    criteria for a finding of contempt of court as summarized by this court in <i>Prescott-Russell Services</i>, <i>supra</i>.  I would therefore dismiss the appeal of the order against Mr. Hobbs for
    contempt of court.  </p>
  <h2>THE COSTS APPEAL OF MR. HOBBS</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On January 25, 2008, the motion judge ordered
    Mr. Hobbs to pay his wife the costs of the motion for contempt against him on a
    full indemnity scale in the total amount of $26,572.17, including disbursements
    and GST.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Since I would not allow Mr. Hobbs’s appeal on
    the merits of the motion for contempt, he requires an order for leave to appeal
    the costs order.  See <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43,
    s. 133(b).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Hobbs accepts that his wife is entitled to
    costs on a full indemnity scale but claims the quantum ordered by the motion
    judge is excessive.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In order to succeed on an application for leave
    to appeal an award of costs, strong grounds must be shown.  In <i>Brad-Jay

    appeal to S.C.C. refused, 2007 CanLII 67861, this court said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Leave to appeal a costs
    order will not be granted save in obvious cases where the party seeking leave
    convinces the court there are “strong grounds upon which the appellate court
    could find that the judge erred in exercising his discretion”.</p>

    27:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A court should set aside
    a costs award on appeal only if the trial judge has made an error in principle

    high side I cannot find that there are strong grounds upon which to conclude
    the motion judge erred in exercising his discretion.  I may well have come to a different
    conclusion on the quantum.  However, that
    is not enough.  I cannot say that the
    quantum is so high that a court could find that it constitutes error in

  <h2>THE APPEAL OF THE DISMISSAL OF THE
    CONTEMPT MOTION AGAINST MS. HOBBS</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After Ms. Hobbs brought contempt proceedings
    against her husband, he brought a cross-motion for contempt against her.  He relied on a number of grounds to support
    his allegations of contempt.  However,
    the only issue on this appeal concerns the alleged failure of Ms. Hobbs to
    provide documentation and information concerning <i>inter alia </i>RBC bank account number 5125232, which had been ordered
    produced by the motion judge on April 26, 2007.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms. Hobbs filed an affidavit of documents sworn
    August 29, 2006 that referred to RBC bank account number 5125232.  Some documents related to the account were
    produced.  When asked about the account,
    Ms. Hobbs advised that she knew nothing about it.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On the motion for contempt against Ms. Hobbs,
    Mr. Hobbs took the position that his wife was intentionally refusing to comply
    with the order of the court.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>By letter dated June 7, 2007, Ms. Hobbs’s
    counsel provided a written direction to the RBC bank to permit her husband to
    obtain relevant documents directly from it.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In his reasons for judgment dated January 25,
    2008, the motion judge said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[32]     In effect Ms. Hobbs’ position is that she
    initially listed what she understood various family accounts to be but in fact
    she has no documentation on this account.  Given that Mr. Hobbs says there is no such account the reasonable
    inference is that Ms. Hobbs initially listed this account number in the
    mistaken belief it was a family account, controlled by Mr. Hobbs, in which she
    had an interest.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[33]     Given that there is complete distrust
    between the parties if Mr. Hobbs harboured the belief that Ms. Hobbs was lying,
    and she had such an account, it would have been a very simple matter for a law
    clerk to send a one paragraph letter to RBC which, at nominal expense, would
    have answered this question.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[34]     To repeat my earlier comment, it borders on
    ridiculous to think that the evidence which I have just reviewed constitutes
    proof beyond a reasonable doubt that Ms. Hobbs was in intentional or wilful
    disregard of this court order.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On this appeal, counsel for Mr. Hobbs seeks to
    file fresh affidavit evidence in which his counsel’s assistant deposes that
    they wrote to the RBC bank requesting information concerning account number
    5125232 and initially received no reply.  The assistant does not indicate the date upon which the letter was
    written.  In any event, they wrote the
    bank manager again on December 12, 2007 and again received no reply.  Counsel’s office wrote the bank manager again
    on January 31, 2008 and received a telephone reply, followed by the receipt of
    documentation related to the RBC account in question on February 4, 2008.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In my view, this evidence does not meet the test
    for admissibility of fresh evidence.  See <i>R. v. Palmer</i>, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759 at
    775.  This information existed at the
    time the motion for contempt was heard.  If due diligence had been exercised, it could have been obtained in time
    for the hearing of the contempt motion.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Even if the evidence was admitted, it would not
    have affected the result.  An affidavit
    of Ms. Hobbs sworn February 25, 2008 and filed in response to this fresh
    evidence makes it clear that she simply made a mistake in respect of the number
    of her bank account and hence believed that account number 5125232 was not her
    account.  Her account was incorrectly
    described as number 4519020 which, as it turns out, was really account number
    5125232.  In these circumstances, I agree
    with the motion judge that there was no intentional conduct on the part of Ms.
    Hobbs to breach the court order in question.  This is really a “tempest in a teapot”.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span

    judge awarded costs on a full indemnity scale, I am not persuaded that the
    costs of the appeals should be granted on either that or a substantial
    indemnity basis.  I would award costs to
    Ms. Hobbs on a partial indemnity scale in the amount of $12,500, including
