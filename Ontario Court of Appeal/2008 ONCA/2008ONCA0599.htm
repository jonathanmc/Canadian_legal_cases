'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent sued the appellant for wrongful dismissal.  After a seven day
    trial, the trial judge found that the appellant had constructively dismissed
    the respondent.  He awarded the respondent damages on the basis of a fifteen
    month notice period together with three months “<i>Wallace</i> damages” and
    vacation and public holiday pay for a period of eight years pursuant to the <i>Employment
    Standards Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. E. 14 and the <i>Employment Standards
    Act, 2000</i>, S.O. 2000, c. 41 (the “<i>Act</i>”).  </p>
  <h2>FACTS</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    the time of the trial, the respondent was fifty-eight years old.  He had
    worked in the used car business for over thirty years.  In 1988, he was hired
    by the appellant as its used car sales manager.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    the first five years, the respondent was paid through a company that he owned
    with a partner.  He was paid on a commission-only basis –
    thirty percent of gross profits.  In 1993, the appellant began to pay the
    respondent directly.  The rate of compensation remained the same as did the
    respondent’s duties as used car sales manager.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    April 2003, the appellant proposed reducing the respondent’s compensation
    from thirty percent to eighteen percent of gross profits, effective December
    2003.  The trial judge accepted the respondent’s evidence that this came
    as a shock to him and that he was disappointed and hurt.  However, the respondent
    accepted the new compensation package and it was implemented in December
    2003.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    March 2004, the appellant proposed reducing the respondent’s compensation
    again, this time, from eighteen percent to nine percent of gross profits.  The
    appellant did not complain about the respondent’s performance as used car
    sales manager.  Rather, the appellant’s sales manager, Mr. Corridore, told
    the respondent that he was making too much money in comparison to others
    in similar positions in the business.  A number of discussions followed.  The
    respondent did not accept the proposed reduction.  The parties were at an
    impasse.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Following
    the discussions in March 2004, the respondent, who was suffering from depression,
    informed the appellant that he had to see a doctor and would be taking time
    off work.  There was no contact between the parties from April 1, 2004 until
    July 2004.  In July, the respondent met with the president of the appellant
    and further discussions ensued.  Again, no resolution was reached, and on
    July 29, 2004, the respondent commenced the within action for wrongful dismissal.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    a seven day trial, the trial judge found in favour of the respondent.  He
    concluded that the respondent had been constructively dismissed and made
    the awards set out in para. 1 above.</p>
  <h2>ANALYSIS</h2>
  <h2>Constructive Dismissal</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant argues that the trial judge erred in finding that it constructively
    dismissed the respondent.  I disagree.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge’s conclusion was based on findings of fact.  He accepted the
    respondent’s evidence that the appellant unilaterally reduced his compensation
    from eighteen to nine percent of gross profits.  He rejected the appellant’s
    evidence that the reduction was merely an opening offer in a negotiation.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge found that the appellant’s unilateral action in changing the
    compensation constituted a fundamental breach of the employment contract
    which entitled the respondent to consider himself constructively dismissed:  <i>Farber
    v. Royal Trust Co.</i>, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 846 at para. 33.  I see no merit
    in this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h2>The Notice Period</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Applying
    the principles in <i>Bardal v. Globe &amp; Mail Limited</i> (1960), 24 D.L.R.
    (2d) 140 (H.C.J.), the trial judge awarded the respondent a notice period
    of fifteen months.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant argues that the trial judge made two errors in arriving at the
    fifteen month period.  First, it says the trial judge erred in taking into
    account that the respondent “had been induced” into leaving an employer,
    in his case self-employment, to join the appellant in 1988.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent testified that in 1988, the owner of the appellant asked him to
    come and work for him.  Initially, the respondent turned him down, but agreed
    after being approached a second time.  He accepted a position as sales manager
    of the used car department.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge accepted this evidence.  I see no error in the way the trial
    judge considered these circumstances as one of several factors in arriving
    at the appropriate notice period.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant also argues that the trial judge erred in considering the first
    five years of the respondent’s work for the appellant in determining the
    appropriate notice period.  During that five year period, the respondent
    was paid his commissions through a pre-existing partnership rather than directly
    to him.  The respondent also provided some services for two other car dealerships
    owned by the same person who owned the appellant.  As a result, the appellant
    says the respondent was actually employed by the appellant for only eleven
    years.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge was alive to the circumstances under which the respondent was
    employed during the first five years.  The trial judge did not rest his conclusion
    that fifteen months notice was the appropriate notice period solely on a
    finding of sixteen years of employment.  Rather, the trial judge considered
    all of the appropriate factors -- the respondent’s age, his responsibilities
    as a used car sales manager, his employment prospects as well as his length
    of service with the appellant -- and considered that fifteen months struck
    a “happy balance”.  I see no basis for interfering with this conclusion. </p>
  <h2><i>Wallace</i> Damages</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant argues that the trial judge erred in awarding the respondent three
    months <i>Wallace</i> damages.  In particular, the appellant takes issue
    with the trial judge’s conclusion that there existed a “toxic work environment” when
    the appellant constructively dismissed the respondent.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge carefully and thoroughly reviewed all of the circumstances surrounding
    the respondent’s dismissal.  He accepted the respondent’s evidence and rejected
    the evidence of the appellant where it differed.  He concluded that the appellant
    demonstrated palpable insensitivity in the manner in which it dealt with
    the respondent.  The appellant was disingenuous and subjected the respondent
    to undue pressure at a time the respondent was in poor health.  The respondent
    felt humiliated and let down by the conduct of the appellant.  The trial
    judge’s characterization of this environment as “toxic” was entirely reasonable.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge’s findings of fact supported an award of damages under the principles
    set out in <i>Wallace v. United Grain Growers Ltd.</i>, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 701.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    the argument of this appeal, the Supreme Court of Canada released its judgment
    in <i>Honda Canada Inc. v. Keays</i>, [2008] S.C.J. No. 40.  Obviously, the
    trial and this appeal were not argued on the basis of the law as set out
    in <i>Honda</i>.  That said, given the trial judge’s strong findings of fact,
    I see no reason to interfere with the <i>Wallace</i> award.  </p>
  <h2>Mitigation of Damages</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    agree with the trial judge that the respondent acted reasonably in trying
    to mitigate his damages.  He confined his job search to the used car sales
    market.  Given that he was fifty-eight years old and had worked for thirty
    years in the used car business, his efforts were appropriate.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    given the “toxic work environment”
    referred to above, it was not reasonable to expect the respondent to continue
    to work for the appellant during the notice period.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant argues that the respondent failed to mitigate because he did not
    apply for disability benefits during the notice period.  The problem with
    this argument is that the appellant did not establish that the respondent
    was entitled to the benefits available under the disability plan.  The evidence
    was equivocal in this respect.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    the appellant did not advise the respondent that the benefits were available,
    and the respondent was unaware that he might qualify for those benefits. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    these circumstances, the trial judge found, correctly in my view, that the
    appellant did not discharge the onus of showing that the respondent failed
    to mitigate his damages by applying for disability benefits.</p>
  <h2>Public
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Holiday and Vacation Pay</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge awarded the respondent compensation for unpaid public holiday
    and vacation pay for 1996 through 2003, as required under the <i>Act</i>.  The
    trial judge accepted the respondent’s evidence that he had not received such
    payments during this period.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant did not keep records as required by the <i>Act</i> relating to
    public holiday and vacation pay.  It was only after a Revenue Canada audit
    in 2003 that the appellant first made a vacation pay payment to the respondent.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The <i>Act</i> requires
    an employer to give an employee time off from work for public holidays and

    appellant argues that the award of public holiday and vacation pay should
    be set aside or reduced.  It makes three arguments.  First, the appellant
    argues that the trial judge erred in holding that the exemption from paying
    public holiday and vacation pay found in s. 3(1)(h) of <i>Regulation 325</i>,
    R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 325 and the successor provision, s. 2(1)(h) of

'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant argues that the exemption sections referred to above should be
    interpreted to include the respondent because he spent one day each week
    away from the appellant’s premises buying and selling cars at the Toronto
    Auto Auction.  As a result, the argument goes, the appellant received part
    of his compensation in respect of offers or sales which were normally made
    at a place other than the appellant’s place of business.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    do not accept this argument.  I do not read these sections as denying statutory
    benefits payable under the <i>Act</i> to salespersons who carry out only
    a small portion of their duties away from the employer’s business premises.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, the subsections are directed at salespersons who normally carry
    out their duties off-site in the sense that they spend most of their time
    away from their employer’s place of business.  I do not read the word
    “normally” in the subsections as applying to a situation in which an employee
    regularly earns a relatively small portion of his or her compensation while
    working off-site.  I read the phrase
    “which offers or sales are normally made at a place other than the place
    of the business of the employer” as encompassing all of the offers or sales
    made by the salesperson.  Consistent with this approach, I understand that
    the reference to a salesperson “who is entitled to receive all or any part
    of his or her remuneration as commissions” simply indicates that the subsections
    apply to a salesperson whose compensation is not entirely based on salary.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>My
    interpretation of the subsections is consistent with what I conclude is the
    purpose of those subsections.  I agree with the decisions of the Ontario
    Labour Relations Board which have identified the purpose of the exemption
    as relating to the control an employer exerts over its employees.  The rationale
    for exempting employees who are
    “normally” away from the employer’s business premises is that employers should
    not be required to provide vacation pay or statutory benefits when they cannot
    control or monitor the hours employees work or how they do their job.  In <i>Isomeric
    Inc.</i>, [2000] O.E.S.A.D. No. 194, the Board was considering the application
    of the exemption to a claim for the statutory minimum wage.  At para. 22,
    it held,</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The exemption found in section 3(1)(h) of Regulation
    325 appears to be based on the notion that employees who are not subject
    to the usual controls of the employer in terms of reporting for duty, or,
    for that matter, actually performing work cannot expect a guarantee of statutory
    minimum wages.</p>

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    interpretation urged by the appellant would deny statutory benefits to an
    employee who spends even a small portion of his or her time away from the
    employer’s premises.  That seems illogical and potentially very unfair.  It
    is reasonable to expect that if the legislature intended that result, it
    would have set that intention out in clear and unequivocal language.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    agree with the trial judge that the respondent did not fall within the exemption
    from statutory benefits set out in the regulations referred to above.  The
    respondent went to the car auction every Tuesday from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00
    or 5:00 p.m.  The rest of the time, he worked on-site.  On Wednesdays and
    Thursdays, he worked from 9:00 a.m. to 9:00 p.m. and on Fridays and Saturdays
    from 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m.  Thus, the respondent spent less than twenty
    percent of his working time away from the appellant’s place of business.  He
    was not “normally” off site.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    accepting that the purpose of the subsections is to exempt employers from
    paying vacation pay and other benefits to employees whom they cannot monitor
    or control, that purpose would not be fulfilled in the case of the respondent.  The
    appellant knew exactly where the respondent was each working day and what
    he was doing.  The appellant was well-positioned to monitor and control the
    way the respondent exercised all of his duties.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    summary, I agree with the trial judge that the respondent did not fall within
    the exemption from statutory benefits set out above.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant’s second argument is that the trial judge erred in awarding the
    respondent the full amount of the vacation pay claimed without taking into
    account the fact that the respondent took at least three days vacation each
    November to go hunting and that on two occasions he took time off for family
    reasons.  This argument assumes erroneously that an employee is not entitled
    to vacation pay when he or she takes time off for a vacation.  Under s. 28
    of the <i>Employment Standards Act, 1990</i>, employees are entitled to receive
    time off for vacation as well as vacation pay.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    the appellant argues that the trial judge erred in allowing public holiday
    and vacation pay going back to 1996 notwithstanding the two year statutory
    limitation period in s. 96(3) of the <i>Act</i> and/or the two year limitation
    period in the <i>Limitations Act</i> <i>2002</i>, S.O. 2002, c. 24, Sch.

    to the <i>Limitations Act, 2002</i>, the appellant first paid the respondent
    vacation pay in December 2003.  The trial judge accepted the respondent’s
    evidence that he was not aware of his entitlement to vacation or public holiday
    pay before that time.  The trial judge held that the respondent’s lack of
    awareness as to his entitlement went to the issue of discoverability.  As
    a result, the respondent’s action, which was commenced in July 2004, was
    well within the two year limitation period in the <i>Limitations Act, 2002</i>.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    see no basis to interfere with the trial judge’s conclusion that the respondent’s
    entitlement to public holiday and vacation pay should not be reduced on the
    basis of the operation of a limitation period.  </p>
