    August 17, 2005, Ms. Susan Thom filed a complaint with the College about
    Dr. Deemar.  In accordance with s. 24 of the <i>Veterinarians Act</i>, R.S.O.
    1990, c. V. 3 (the “Act”), the complaint was first considered and investigated
    by the College’s Complaints Committee.  The Complaints Committee then referred
    the complaint to the Discipline Committee for a formal hearing.  It is the
    duty of the Discipline Committee to hear and determine allegations of professional
    misconduct or serious neglect made against a member of the College when a
    complaint is referred to it by the Complaints Committee pursuant to s. 30
    of the Act.  The Discipline Committee has the power to impose discipline
    on a member ranging from a reprimand to the revocation of license. </p>

line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Discipline Committee served a notice of hearing on Dr. Deemar on May 23,
    2006 together with a statement of allegations that mirrored Ms. Thom’s complaint.
    The statement of allegations reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>1.         Dr.
    SHERRY DEEMAR (“Dr. Deemar”) was, at all material times, a veterinarian licensed
    to practice veterinary medicine in the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Province of
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Ontario.  Dr. Deemar practiced at

    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>2.         On
    or about August 4, 2005, Ms. Susan Thom (“Ms. Thom”) brought her dog Jake
    to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">
    Buckingham
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Veterinary
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Hospital (“BVH”).  Jake had a rash on both sides of his face.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>3.         Ms.
    Thom asked Ms. Jennifer Todd (“Ms. Todd”), Dr. Deemar’s auxiliary, if a veterinarian
    was available to see Jake.  Ms. Todd told Ms. Thom that she would go to the
    back of BVH and see if the veterinarian could see Jake.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>4.         Upon
    returning, Ms. Todd advised Ms. Thom that the veterinarian could see Jake.  At
    no time was Ms. Thom asked about Jake’s medical history or any questions
    about the rash.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>5.         Ms.
    Todd took Jake from Ms. Thom and started taking him to the back of BVH.  When
    Ms. Thom started to follow Ms. Todd, Ms. Todd told Ms. Thom to wait at the
    front reception area.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>6.         Approximately
    10 minutes later, Ms. Todd returned with Jake.  Ms. Todd advised Ms. Thom
    that the veterinarian diagnosed Jake with bug bites and he needed antibiotics.  Ms.
    Thom asked Ms. Todd if the rash was contagious and Ms. Todd replied, “I don’t
    think so”.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>7.         Unsatisfied
    with Ms. Todd’s response, Ms. Thom asked to speak directly to the veterinarian.  Ms.
    Todd responded that the veterinarian was too busy to see her.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>8.         After
    Ms. Thom continued to press to speak with the veterinarian, Ms. Todd finally
    conceded that no veterinarian was present and that Ms. Todd had spoken with
    the veterinarian (Dr. Deemar) by telephone.  After further brief discussion
    with Ms. Todd, Ms. Thom left BVH with Jake and spoke with her husband about
    the matter in the BVH parking lot.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>9.         Approximately
    5 minutes later, Ms. Todd came out of BVH and spoke with Ms. Thom in the
    parking lot.  Ms. Todd asked Ms. Thom if she could return to BVH to speak
    with the veterinarian who was on the telephone.  Ms. Thom agreed.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>10.       During
    this telephone conversation, which took place between Dr. Deemar and Ms.
    Thom, Dr. Deemar advised Ms. Thom that she was out on a call seeing a horse
    and that this was the only way that they could help her.  Ms. Thom explained
    that she was upset that Ms. Todd misled her that Dr. Deemar was in fact present
    at BVH.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>11.       Dr.
    Deemar encouraged Ms. Thom to take the antibiotics that Ms. Todd had prepared
    for Jake because, according to Dr. Deemar, Jake’s face was swollen and he
    needed the medication.  Ms. Thom responded that Jake’s face was not swollen
    and that Dr. Deemar had not even been given an accurate description to order
    to make an appropriate diagnosis.  After further discussion with Dr. Deemar,
    Ms. Thom left BVH.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>12.       Dr.
    Deemar engaged in professional misconduct within the meaning of paragraphs
    1 (an act or omission inconsistent with the Act or the Regulation – sections
    19 and 33 of Ontario Regulation 1093 under the <i>Veterinarians Act</i>),
    2 (standards of practice), 8 (making a misrepresentation to a client or a
    perspective client), 30 (failing to direct or supervise, or inadequately
    directing or supervising, an auxiliary), 31 (permitting, counselling or assisting
    any person, other than a member, to practice, or to attempt to practice,
    veterinary medicine), 32 (permitting, advising or assisting any person, other
    than a member, to perform any act or function which should properly be performed
    by a member), and 44 (disgraceful, dishonourable or unprofessional conduct)
    of subsection 17(1) of Ontario regulation 1093 under the <i>Veterinarians
    Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Deemar retained Dr. Barbara Leslie as an expert witness and served a report
    from her on the College in advance of the hearing. Dr. Leslie was employed
    by the College from 1989 until February 2006, when the College terminated
    her employment. She was the College’s Registrar from February 2002 until
    the termination of her employment. The termination of her employment, while
    not for cause, was acrimonious. Following the termination, Dr. Leslie’s counsel
    sent a draft statement of claim to counsel for the College seeking general
    and aggravated damages and other relief.  At the time of the Discipline Committee’s
    rulings at issue, the implicit threat of litigation had not been withdrawn. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    College brought a motion to strike Dr. Leslie’s report and to exclude her
    evidence.  While the Discipline Committee did not question Dr. Leslie’s expertise
    in the area of veterinary medicine, it allowed the motion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the Committee found that Dr. Leslie’s report contained advocacy and offered
    her opinion as to the credibility of a witness. The Discipline Committee
    stated that “Dr. Leslie strays from the function of an expert and interprets
    information and draws conclusions related to her interpretation and, in doing
    so, takes on the role of advocate and possibly the role of the trier of fact.” The
    Discipline Committee cited the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R.
    v. Marquard</i>, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 223, which stated at para. 49 that “[i]t
    is a fundamental axiom of our trial process that the ultimate conclusion
    as to the credibility or truthfulness of a particular witness is for the
    trier of fact, and is not the proper subject of expert opinion.” The Discipline
    Committee concluded that Dr. Leslie’s advocacy was sufficient reason to exclude
    her expert <span lang=EN-US>report</span>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Additionally,
    the Discipline Committee found that Dr. Leslie’s presentation of evidence “could
    cause a reasonable person to have a reasonable apprehension of bias on the
    part of the members of the Committee hearing the matter.” The Discipline
    Committee rejected Dr. Deemar’s submission that Dr. Leslie’s evidence and
    the contents of her report, or parts thereof, should be admitted into evidence,
    and its weight determined at the hearing.  It did so because “[p]roceeding
    in that manner would abrogate the function and purpose of this hearing called
    to decide the matter and would also create the potential that members of
    the panel at the hearing would be exposed to Dr. Leslie’s report [and] would
    be influenced by the wording Dr. Leslie uses.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    John Henry was another expert retained by Dr. Deemar.  The Discipline Committee
    also struck his expert report.  It noted that Dr. Henry’s report was focused
    on three areas: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;
'>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether
    the Complaints Committee should have offered alternative dispute resolution
    to Dr. Deemar;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;
'>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether
    the College should have compensated Dr. Deemar for legal expenses; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;
'>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    general propriety of the Complaints Committee having referred these allegations
    of professional misconduct to the Discipline Committee.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Discipline Committee found that Dr. Henry’s report was inadmissible primarily
    because these matters were irrelevant to the question before the Discipline
    Committee. – i.e., whether Dr. Deemar had engaged in professional misconduct.
    The Discipline Committee left it open to Dr. Deemar to offer other relevant
    evidence from Dr. Henry at the hearing. The Discipline Committee’s analysis
    was correct.</p>

    can be seen, the Complaints Committee has no authority to require a person

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Deemar’s right to choose her own experts is qualified by the jurisdiction
    of the tribunal to rule on the admissibility of evidence. The Discipline
    Committee gave multiple reasons for excluding Dr. Leslie’s evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    Dr. Leslie’s report was largely advocacy.  An illustration is that it submitted
    that the Discipline Committee should believe Dr. Deemar’s auxiliary and disbelieve
    the complainant and offered a number of reasons why.  The greater part of
    Dr. Leslie’s report was of like nature. Certainly the report also expressed
    expert opinion on relevant issues. For example, Dr. Leslie opined that it
    is acceptable for a veterinarian
    “to delegate the tasks of history taking, inquiry, assessment, advising and
    dispensing of a prescription, to an auxiliary under indirect supervision”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the Discipline Committee might have struck the advocacy in the report and
    allowed Dr. Deemar to file the balance of the report, it chose to strike
    the whole report and disqualify Dr. Leslie from testifying. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is up to the trier of fact to qualify a proposed expert witness. The party
    tendering the proposed expert witness must satisfy the trier that he or she
    possesses not only the necessary expertise, but the requisite independence
    as well. For example, the trier may refuse to qualify a person of unquestioned
    expertise who is closely related to the tendering party.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here
    the Discipline Committee found that Dr. Leslie had
    “strayed from the function of an expert” and had taken on “the role of advocate
    and possibly the role of the trier of fact”.  The Discipline Committee noted
    that an expert must have a minimum requirement of independence and cited
    authority that “if the person rendering the evidence assumes the role of
    advocate, he or she can no longer be viewed as an expert in the legally correct
    sense…”.  <i>Perricone</i> <i>v.</i> <i>Baldassara</i>, [1994] O.J. No. 2199
    at para. 17.  Dr. Leslie’s demonstrated lack of the independence provided
    an ample basis for the Discipline Committee’s to refuse to accept Dr. Leslie
    as an expert witness.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Discipline Committee also determined that Dr. Leslie could not give any evidence
    at the discipline hearing because of her recent relationship with the College.  Dr.
    Leslie had been the College’s Registrar for most of the period during which
    the complaint against Dr. Deemar was under investigation.  While Dr. Leslie
    had not personally dealt with the complaint, she was administratively responsible
    for it.  The fact that all of the Discipline Committee’s members were on
    the College Council when the College terminated Dr. Leslie’s employment presented
    the Discipline Committee with a difficult dilemma. This combination of circumstances
    made it unseemly, at the very least, for Dr. Leslie to testify regarding
    the merits of the complaint. The Discipline Committee addressed the dilemma
    by ruling that Dr. Leslie could not appear as a witness.  The
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court, which also took the view that Dr. Leslie’s appearance before
    the Committee’s current members was untenable, sought to address the dilemma
    by halting the complaint proceedings until the composition of the Committee
    changed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    resolution of the dilemma required the balancing of the interests of the
    member and the interests of the administration of justice generally. Dr.
    Deemar’s interest was in controlling her defence to the complaint.  At the
    same time there was a public interest in the prompt disposition of allegations
    of professional misconduct against a member of a regulated profession.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view,<i> </i>assuming the standard of review is correctness<i>,</i> the
    ruling of the Discipline Committee correctly balanced the interests of the
    member and the interests of the administration of justice generally.  In
    ruling that Dr. Leslie could not appear as a witness, the Discipline Committee
    noted that Dr. Deemar had ample opportunity
    “to obtain a separate expert opinion that was equally valid”.  Thus, the
    Discipline Committee’s decision struck a reasonable balance between the individual
    and public interests at stake. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    contrast, the stay ordered by the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court frustrates the Discipline Committee’s statutory duty to
    hear and determine the complaint, without consideration of the alternatives
    available to Dr. Deemar.  In my view, this is not an acceptable option.  The
    only other viable option would have been to leave the admissibility of Dr.
    Leslie’s opinion to the members of the Discipline Committee hearing the complaint
    who would inevitably have reached the same conclusion.  In my view, the option
    chosen by the Committee provided the fairest result for Dr. Deemar and allowed
    her to obtain other opinions that were readily available to her.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    find support for that view that Dr. Deemar was accorded procedural fairness
    in the decision of Rothstein J., sitting as a trial judge of the Federal
    Court in <i>Drummond v. 
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    </i>(1996), 33 Imm. L.R. (2d) 258.  Rothstein J. judicially reviewed the
    decision of the Immigration Appeal Division excluding the evidence of an
    expert who had been a member of the Division until three months before the
    hearing.  In upholding the Appeal Division’s decision, Rothstein J. observed
    that while the tribunal must generally not reject evidence, there was reason
    to do so in this case.  The expert had a collegial relationship with a presiding
    member, and the admission of his affidavit could give rise to a reasonable
    apprehension of bias.  As well, Rothstein J. concluded that the Appeal Division
    could not have admitted the affidavit and then given it little or no weight
    because of the affidavit’s “overtone of bias”; the affidavit had to be rejected
    in its entirety (para. 9).</p>

line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite
    the factual differences in <i>Drummond</i>, that case fortifies my view that
    the Discipline Committee’s decision how to deal with the difficult situation

    to s. 28 of the Act, a panel of the Discipline Committee must be composed
    of no fewer than three persons, at least one of whom is a person whom the
    Lieutenant Governor in Council has appointed as a member of the Council and
    at least one of whom is a person who is both a member of the College and
    a member of the Council.  Thus, the disposition of the Divisional Court would
    delay the complaint proceeding until the Lieutenant Governor appoints a different
    layperson to the Council and the College holds an election in which new members
    are elected to the Council. This proposed remedy, if implemented, would unduly
    delay the proceedings. As already discussed, the remedy of ruling Dr. Leslie’s
    evidence inadmissible was preferable.</p>
