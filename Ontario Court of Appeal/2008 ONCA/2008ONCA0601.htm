  <h4>A.        OVERVIEW</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent, James Ellis, was the president and sole shareholder of El-Bris
    Limited.  His company had developed land and built homes for many years.  The
    appellant, Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), was the company’s banker.  In late
    1992, RBC agreed to increase its loan to El-Bris from $200,000 to $700,000.  Ellis
    gave security for this loan increase to his company.  He personally guaranteed
    the loan.  He also pledged to the bank a $700,000 collateral mortgage on
    property that he owned. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Over
    the ensuing decade the company’s borrowing from RBC increased to about $3.5
    million.  By 2003, however, El-Bris had become insolvent.  RBC called the
    loan and claimed against Ellis under its security.  Ellis paid RBC $700,000
    and asked for a discharge of the collateral mortgage and a release of his
    guarantee.  RBC gave Ellis a discharge of the mortgage but demanded an additional
    $700,000 under his guarantee.  When Ellis refused to pay this additional
    amount, RBC sued both him and El-Bris.  RBC claimed that Ellis’s obligation
    under the collateral mortgage was separate from his obligation under his
    guarantee.  Ellis defended by asserting that he gave the collateral mortgage
    as support for or security for his guarantee, and that the discharge of the
    one discharged his obligation under the other.  He sought rectification of
    both the mortgage and the guarantee to give effect to his position.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge, E. Ducharme J., granted judgment against the insolvent company,
    El-Bris.  However, he dismissed RBC’s action against Ellis.  He accepted
    that ordinarily the terms of the “mortgage and the guarantee on their face
    would have bound Mr. Ellis to pay El-Bris’s entire debt to the monetary limit
    of each security instrument”.  Nonetheless, he concluded that both the documentary
    and oral evidence showed the parties’ common intention that the collateral
    mortgage stand as security for Ellis’s guarantee.  Or, as the trial judge
    persuasively put it:
    “I find that in offering to advance El-Bris’s line of credit by $700,000.00,
    neither the bank nor Mr. Ellis intended to create a personal obligation on
    the part of Mr. Ellis in the amount of $1,400,000.00”.  He granted a declaration
    that Ellis’s guarantee obligation was extinguished by the payment of $700,000
    to RBC in 2003.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>RBC’s
    principal submission on appeal is that the trial judge erred by failing to
    give effect to the words of the documents, each of which expressed a separate
    payment obligation.  RBC contends that an experienced businessman such as
    Ellis should not be able to use the remedy of rectification to avoid an obligation
    clearly spelled out in the documents he signed.  Moreover, RBC says that
    Ellis has failed to satisfy the four prerequisites to rectification set out
    by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Performance Industries Ltd. v. Sylvan
    Lake Golf &amp; Tennis Club</i>, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 678.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ellis
    submits that the declaratory relief extinguishing his obligation under the
    guarantee was grounded in the trial judge’s factual findings and that RBC
    has not shown any basis to interfere with these findings.  Alternatively,
    Ellis submits that his obligation under the guarantee was discharged because
    RBC materially varied the terms of its loan to El-Bris without Ellis’s consent.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge did not deal with Ellis’s alternative submission, and I do not
    need to do so either.  I would not give effect to RBC’s submission and would
    therefore dismiss its appeal.  Although the trial judge did not use the word “rectification” in
    his reasons, his findings of fact convincingly supported Ellis’s claim for
    rectification.  These findings of fact are, as Ellis contends, reasonably
    supported by the evidence and I would therefore defer to them.  Indeed, on
    this record, accepting RBC’s position would produce an inequitable and unfair
    result.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>B.        DISCUSSION</span></h4>

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Windsor,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario.  In the early 1980s his company began banking with RBC at its
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Windsor branch office.  Ellis dealt with the bank’s account manager, Robert
    Langley, who is now retired.  At the end of 1992, Ellis and Langley negotiated
    an increase in El-Bris’s operating line of credit to $700,000.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

    asked for and obtained security for its loan both from El-Bris and Ellis.  El-Bris
    pledged to the bank a $750,000 floating debenture, the company’s common shares
    registered in Ellis’s name and money due under a mortgage it held on a 30-unit
    apartment building in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Windsor.  El-Bris also assigned to RBC a $500,000 term insurance policy on
    Ellis’ life.  Ellis gave the bank the two pieces of security that are the
    subject of this litigation: a $700,000 collateral second mortgage on property
    he owned in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Windsor, and his personal guarantee for $700,000.  Ellis signed both documents
    on the same day, February 12, 1993.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    collateral mortgage did not contain a term stating that Ellis was giving
    the mortgage in support of his guarantee.  Instead, it contained the standard
    charge terms, which included a covenant to pay and a provision, clause 30,
    that the charge was in addition to any other security held by RBC.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>30. Other Security – The Charge is in addition
    to and not in substitution for any other security held by the Chargee including
    any promissory note or notes for all or any part of the monies secured hereunder,
    and it is understood and agreed that the Chargee may pursue its remedies
    thereunder or hereunder concurrently or successively at its option.  Any
    judgment or recovery hereunder of under any other security held by the Chargee
    for the monies secured by the Charge shall not affect the right of the Chargee
    to realize upon this or any other security.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly,
    the guarantee Ellis signed – which appears to be a standard bank guarantee – did
    not refer to the collateral mortgage.  Instead, it simply required Ellis
    to pay on demand El-Bris’s liability to RBC up to $700,000 plus interest.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    by their terms, and as RBC claims, the collateral mortgage and guarantee
    imposed on Ellis separate and independent obligations to pay the bank $700,000
    plus interest on El-Bris’s default.  The trial judge recognized that, under
    ordinary circumstances, this would have been so.  However, the trial judge
    did not consider this case to be the “ordinary or usual case”.  He rejected
    the bank’s claim “that the mortgage and the guarantee are or were ever intended
    to be discrete, independent documents” (para. 38). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge concluded that the documents did not accurately reflect the agreement
    Ellis and RBC had made.  In substance, he rectified these documents to reflect
    their agreement that the collateral mortgage was security for Ellis’s guarantee.  That
    is why the trial judge declared that, as Ellis had paid RBC $700,000 to discharge
    the collateral mortgage, he had no further obligation under his guarantee.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>2.
            The Remedy of Rectification </b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rectification
    is an equitable remedy designed to ensure that one party is not unjustly
    enriched at the expense of another.  A court will rectify an inaccurately
    drawn written agreement so that it conforms to the agreement the parties
    intended to make.  In <i>Downtown King West Development Corp. v. Massey Ferguson
    Industries Ltd.</i> (1996), 28 O.R. (3d) 327 at 336 (C.A.), Robins J.A. explained
    the remedy’s underlying rationale, while acknowledging that rectification
    cannot be used to correct every mistake.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The remedy of rectification is available only in
    certain defined circumstances and cannot be invoked to correct every mistake.  In
    principle, rectification is permitted, not for the purpose of altering the
    terms of an agreement, but to correct a contract which has been mistakenly
    drawn so as to carry out the common intention of the parties and have the
    contract reflect their true agreement.  The remedy is normally granted only
    where the mistake is mutual or common to the contracting parties.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>RBC,
    however, argues that to obtain an order for rectification Ellis must show
    more than a common intention. He must also satisfy <i>Sylvan’s</i> four prerequisites
    to rectification. I do not agree. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> <i>Sylvan</i> was
    a case of unilateral mistake. The party seeking rectification, because of
    his own negligence, had mistakenly signed an inaccurately drawn document.  Binnie
    J., writing for court, set out four prerequisites for parties seeking rectification
    for unilateral mistake: (i) a previous oral agreement inconsistent with the
    written document; (ii) the other party knew or ought to have known of the
    mistake and permitting that party to take advantage of the mistake would
    amount to unfair dealing;  (iii) the document can be precisely rewritten
    to express the parties’ intention; and (iv) each of the first three prerequisites
    must be demonstrated by convincing proof.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    case before us is not a case of unilateral mistake.  On the trial judge’s
    reasonable view of the record, it is a case of common mistake: when entering
    into the written agreement neither party intended to create two independent
    $700,000 obligations.  Both thought the obligations were connected </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    prerequisites in <i>Sylvan</i> do not apply to cases of common or mutual
    mistake. The following statement by Binnie J. para. 31 of <i>Sylvan</i> clarifies
    the scope of the application of the prerequisites:
    “The traditional rule was to permit rectification only for mutual mistake,
    but rectification is now available for unilateral mistake (as here), provided
    certain demanding preconditions are met.” <i>Sylvan</i>, in effect, broadened
    the circumstances in which courts could rectify a unilateral mistake, allowing
    rectification subject to the “demanding preconditions” outlined above. It
    left untouched the circumstances, under the
    “traditional rule,” in which courts could rectify a mutual or common mistake.

            Application </b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the trial judge did not use the word
    “rectification,” his main finding clearly supports his use of what was in
    effect the remedy of rectification.  At para. 39 of his reasons, the trial
    judge said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I find that when Mr. Ellis and Mr. Langley consummated
    their agreement in February, 1993 their common intention was for the collateral
    mortgage on the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Goyeau Street property he owned to stand as security for his guarantee in
    the event he defaulted on the latter.  I make this finding without the slightest
    doubt or reservation.  To put the matter another way, I find that in offering
    to advance El-Bris’s line of credit by $700,000.00, neither the bank nor
    Mr. Ellis intended to create a personal obligation on the part of Mr. Ellis
    in the amount of $1,400,000.00.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    paragraph echoes the rationale for rectification discussed in <i>Downtown
    King West</i>. As I noted earlier, in that case Robins J.A. said that rectification
    is permitted “to correct a contract which has been mistakenly drawn so as
    to carry out the common intention of the parties and have the contract reflect
    their true agreement.” See also <i>H.F. Clarke Ltd. v. Thermidaire Corp.
    Ltd.</i>, [1973] 2 O.R. 57 at 64 - 65 (
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), rev’d on other grounds [1976] 1 S.C.R. 319.  In altering the agreement
    to reflect the parties’ clear “common intention” that the collateral mortgage
    was to secure the guarantee, this is what the trial judge did. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    only remaining question is: Was the trial judge’s finding of common intention
    reasonable? In my view, the answer is yes. The finding of common intention
    is reasonably supported by the documents, the oral evidence of the parties,
    and even by the parties’ later conduct. </p>

    a letter of undertaking under the <i>Construction Lien Act</i> and a <i>Planning
    Act</i> certificate prepared by the bank and signed by Ellis in connection
    with the loan to El-Bris described the $700,000 collateral mortgage as “for
    James W. Ellis”, not for the benefit of El-Bris.  The wording suggests that
    the mortgage was to support an obligation of Ellis to the bank, and his only
    obligation to the bank was under his guarantee.</p>

    para. 40 of his reasons the trial judge summarized the import of the documentary
    evidence.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I have read carefully both the mortgage and the
    guarantee.  As I have earlier said, Mr. Ellis signed them on the same day
    and limited them in the same principal amounts and rates of interest.  Moreover,
    they were part of and followed from his negotiation with the bank leading
    to the bank’s offer to increase the company’s line of credit by $700,000.00,
    precisely the amount specified in each security.  In these circumstances,
    it is clear to me beyond all doubt that the documents were and were intended
    to be, in effect, mirror images of one another, complementary elements of
    a unitary undertaking or commitment, the purpose of which was to give the
    bank the comfort it needed in exchange for increasing El-Bris’s operating
    line by $700,000.00.  The preponderance of the oral evidence adduced at the
    trial merely reinforces this conclusion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ordinarily
    parol evidence at odds with the terms of a written agreement is inadmissible.  Evidence
    relevant to claims for rectification is an exception to this rule.  A court
    may admit parol evidence to determine whether to rectify the terms of a written
    agreement to conform to the real intention of the parties.  See <i>Chant
    v. Infinitum Growth Fund Inc. </i>(1986), 28 D.L.R. (4th) 577 at 580 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    ), Robins J.A.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    determining that the words of the collateral mortgage and guarantee did not
    accord with the true intention of the parties the trial judge relied on Ellis’s
    testimony.  Ellis testified that he and Langley intended to treat the mortgage
    as
    “support for the guarantee”.  The trial judge found Ellis to be an “honest,
    honourable and fair” witness.  On the critical issue of the parties’
    intention, he accepted Ellis’s evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless,
    RBC argues that the trial judge erred in permitting Ellis to avoid his obligations “based
    solely on his own uncorroborated testimony”.  There are three answers to
    the bank’s argument.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    a court may order rectification even if the testimony of the party seeking
    rectification is not corroborated by documentary evidence.  See <i>Sylvan</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    at para. 43.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    in this case Ellis’s evidence was not uncorroborated.  The documentary evidence
    that I have already outlined confirmed his evidence.  Putting it the other
    way around, as the trial judge did, “the preponderance of the oral evidence
    adduced at trial merely reinforces this conclusion” – that is, the conclusion
    the trial judge drew from the documents themselves.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    the evidence of Langley, the bank’s account manager at the time, is consistent
    with Ellis’s evidence.  As the trial judge pointed out, the two people who
    could speak directly to what the parties intended were Ellis and Langley. 
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Langley had virtually no recollection of his dealings with Ellis.  But on
    cross-examination, after having looked at the documents, he conceded that “it
    would be fair to conclude” that the collateral mortgage was given to support
    the guarantee.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    reviewed the documents and oral evidence, the trial judge at para. 43 repeated
    his finding that Ellis’s obligation to RBC was limited to $700,000.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In summary, then, I have no hesitation in finding
    that the business arrangement struck by Mr. Langley and Mr. Ellis called
    for the bank to increase El-Bris’s line of credit by $700,000.00, in exchange
    for which Mr. Ellis was required to provide a personal guarantee limited
    to the amount of $700,000.00, supported by a collateral second mortgage in
    the same amount.  In other words, it was emphatically not the intention of
    the parties that in exchange for a $700,000.00 line of credit for El-Bris
    Mr. Ellis would create a personal guarantee in the amount of $1,400,000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    am not persuaded that the trial judge’s finding is unreasonable.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>(c)       <i>Later</i> <i>conduct</i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    unnecessary to the trial judge’s finding of common intention, the trial judge
    concluded that the parties’ later conduct was consistent with that finding.  Evidence
    of later conduct consistent with a claim for rectification is relevant and
    admissible.  See <i>Bercovici v. Palmer</i> (1966), 59 D.L.R. (2d) 513 (Sask.
    Q.B.), aff’d (1966) 59 D.L.R. (2d) 516 (Sask. C.A.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    March 18, 2003, Ellis’s lawyer sent a letter to RBC’s senior account manager
    in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    London,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario, who now had responsibility for the El-Bris account.  The letter
    stated Ellis’s intent to pay out the collateral mortgage, which it described
    as a mortgage in support of Ellis’s guarantee.  In the letter Ellis’s lawyer
    asked that on payment of the mortgage, the bank provide a discharge and release
    Ellis from his guarantee.  Two days later Ellis’s lawyer sent RBC a cheque
    for $700,000.  The bank immediately deposited the cheque but it did not tell
    Ellis or his lawyer that it did not intend to release the guarantee.  Instead,
    RBC waited six months before it responded in writing that “it was never intended
    that the guarantee would be released upon the discharge of the mortgage”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    terms of the letter from Ellis’s lawyer, and RBC’s depositing of the cheque
    and failing for some time to reply to the letter, are additional pieces of
    evidence that support the trial judge’s finding.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    end with this.  <i>Sylvan</i> and other cases warn against the floodgates.  They
    warn against permitting rectification to be granted too readily.  They caution
    that parties, especially experienced and sophisticated parties, cannot routinely
    look to this remedy to correct mistakes in signed contracts.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the trial judge’s decision in this case does not open the floodgates.  Rather,
    his decision turns narrowly on its facts.  To return to the trial judge’s
    central theme: to permit RBC to collect $1,400,000 on its security for a
    $700,000 loan amounts to unfair dealing.  It would unjustly enrich the bank
    at Ellis’s expense.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>C.        CONCLUSION</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would dismiss the bank’s appeal.  The trial judge’s finding that the parties
    intended the collateral mortgage to be security for Ellis’s guarantee was
    reasonably supported by the evidence.  Therefore, as Ellis had paid off the
    collateral mortgage, he was entitled to a discharge of his obligation under
    the guarantee.  Ellis is entitled to his costs of the appeal in the amount
    agreed on by the parties, $13,959 inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
