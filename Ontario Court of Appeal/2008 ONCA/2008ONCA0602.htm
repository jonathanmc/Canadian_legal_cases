    appellant was charged with five offenses arising out of an altercation between
    the appellant and his “girlfriend” the complainant.  He was ultimately acquitted
    on three of the charges but convicted of one count of assault with a weapon
    (a gold chain) and a count of break and enter and assault.  He received a
    sentence of thirty days to be served on the weekends.  He had also spent
    some time in custody prior to his conviction.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    on behalf of the appellant has raised four grounds of appeal.  In the course
    of his argument counsel thoroughly analyzed the reasons of the trial judge.  Aspects
    of the reasons are not without some difficulty.  We are not satisfied that
    the reasons demonstrate reversible error.  We will deal briefly with each
    ground of appeal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge did not misapply the principle set down in <i>R. v. W.D.</i>  He
    began his judgment by eluding to that decision and concluded his judgment
    by acquitting the appellant on one count based on an application of the third
    step in <i>R. v. W.D.</i>  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge did conclude that the complainant had no motive to fabricate
    her evidence in so far as it implicated the appellant in the charges.  It
    was open to the trial judge on the evidence to come to that conclusion.  We
    cannot agree that he overemphasized the absence of motive.  It was clearly
    one factor he considered in assessing the complainants credibility.  With
    respect to counsel’s argument, there is nothing in the reasons of the trial
    judge that supports the contention that the trial judge concluded that the
    appellant was credible exclusively because she had no motive to fabricate
    her evidence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not agree that the trial judge misapprehended the appellant’s evidence
    as to the number of times the appellant struck the complainant with his gold
    chain.  The appellant testifies that he struck the complainant with his chain
    while they were fighting in the car.  It is unclear from the appellant’s
    evidence whether he struck her once or more than once.  What is clear from
    the appellant’s evidence is that there were no other occasions, other than
    the incident in the car during which the appellant conceded striking the
    complainant with the chain.  The complainant testified that the appellant
    struck her with the chain in the hotel room.  The trial judge reviewed the
    physical evidence and concluded that it was impossible for the appellant
    to have struck the complainant with the chain while they were in the vehicle.  This
    conclusion was open to him based on the nature and location of the bruises
    inflicted by the chain.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge in his reasons indicated that there was no evidence that the
    appellant struck the complainant on more than one occasion with his chain.  That
    is an accurate summary of the evidence.  The appellant did not testify to
    striking the complainant on more than one occasion and the complainant did
    not suggest that the appellant struck her on more than one occasion.  The
    dispute was over whether the appellant struck her in the car or in the hotel
    room.  If he struck her in the hotel room, as the trial judge found, then
    the appellant’s self defence claim could not succeed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    are aspects of the complainant’s evidence that are troubling.  The trial
    judge addressed these issues, particularly her evidence concerning the manner
    in which the appellant broke in to her hotel room.  This evidence was central
    to the break and enter charge.  The physical evidence did not support the
    complainant’s evidence as to how the appellant gained entry.  She offered
    an explanation for the absence of physical evidence to support her assertion
    that the appellant broke the lock as he entered.  She claimed, for the first
    time in cross examination, that the appellant fixed the lock at some later
    time.  While one may wonder about the credibility of this explanation it
    was for the trial judge to assess this explanation in the context of the
    entirety of the evidence and make his own determination of the complainant’s
    credibility.  The trial judge did exactly that.  He referred to this evidence,
    acknowledged the concern with respect to the accuracy of this part of the
    complainant’s evidence.  He also referred to the absence of any confirmatory
    evidence on this part of the complainant’s evidence.  Ultimately however
    he accepted her evidence that the appellant forced his way into the hotel
    room.  That finding was enough to warrant a conviction on the break and enter
    charge.  It is not our function to retry the case or make our own assessment
    of the evidence.  We cannot interfere with the trial judge’s finding.</p>
