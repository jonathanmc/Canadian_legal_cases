style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    April 13, 2001, the appellant was convicted of the first-degree murder of
    Diane Werendowicz by Lofchik J. sitting with a jury. Ms. Werendowicz’s body
    was found in a ravine in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Stoney Creek on June 20, 1981. She was lying face down in a creek with a
    tire over her head and her purse strap wrapped around her neck. Pathologists
    confirmed the cause of her death as strangulation and drowning. Forensic
    testing revealed the presence of semen on her jeans and in her vagina.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms.
    Werendowicz’s murder remained unsolved for many years. In 1997, a police
    task force was formed to investigate a number of unsolved crimes that had
    taken place in the same ravine. As a result of scientific advances, DNA profiling
    was then available and the Centre for Forensic Sciences was able to extract
    a DNA profile from the semen found at the scene of the murder. The police
    sought DNA samples from several suspects, including the appellant. Forensic
    testing on a discarded sample from the appellant confirmed that his DNA matched
    the DNA profile of the semen found on Ms. Werendowicz’s body. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant was arrested for the murder of Ms. Werendowicz and another serious
    offence on December 1, 1998. Following his arrest, he gave a videotaped statement
    to the police in which he denied knowing or recognizing the deceased or having
    any involvement in her murder. On being informed that the police had a DNA
    match, the appellant said he did not have an explanation and it would be
    up to his lawyer to answer any more questions. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    trial, the Crown alleged that the appellant sexually assaulted the deceased
    in the ravine, strangled her with her purse, and drowned her in the creek.
    Among other things, the Crown relied on the DNA evidence, an audiotape of
    a 911 call made two days after the murder in which the caller provided details
    of the murder that were not widely known, the evidence of several witnesses
    who identified the appellant’s voice as that of the 911 caller, and the appellant’s
    statement to the police in which he denied any relationship with the deceased,
    an apparent fabrication. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant testified at trial and claimed that he had consensual sex in 1981
    with a female stranger he met in the parking lot of a bar near the ravine.
    He said that he and the woman smoked a joint in his truck and then had sex.
    According to the appellant, he never saw the woman again after she left his
    truck. The appellant denied being in the ravine with the deceased, killing
    her, or placing the 911 call. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although
    he said he did not know the identity of the woman with whom he had sex until
    he was told about the DNA match, the appellant acknowledged putting “two
    and two together through the reports in the newspaper”. He said he did not
    provide this explanation in his statement to the police because he did not
    think they would believe him. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant called several witnesses at trial who testified that it was not
    the appellant’s voice on the 911 tape.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant raises four issues on appeal:</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'><span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    trial judge erred in failing to exclude the appellant’s statement to the
    police based on ss. 10(b) and s. 24(2) of the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights
    and Freedoms</i>;</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, the first issue raised by the appellant is dispositive of the appeal.
    It is therefore not strictly necessary that I deal with the remaining issues
    raised by the appellant. That said, I consider that it would have been preferable
    had the trial judge provided the jury with further instructions concerning
    the specific frailties of the voice identification evidence that was led
    in this case and had he not given the impugned instruction concerning the
    burden of proof. I consider it unnecessary to comment on the second ground
    of appeal.</p>

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Following
    his arrest, the appellant asked to speak to a specific lawyer, Neil Jones.
    When he was unable to reach Mr. Jones, he attempted to contact two other
    lawyers and eventually spoke to one of Mr. Jones’s partners. After a brief
    telephone conversation with the partner, the appellant told the arresting
    officer that he had instructed the partner to keep trying to get in touch
    with Mr. Jones. On being asked by the arresting officer if he was satisfied
    he had spoken to counsel, the appellant said yes, but asked if he could make
    another call. The arresting officer refused and proceeded to interview the
    appellant. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    main issue concerning this ground of appeal is whether the trial judge erred
    in failing to find that the appellant’s s. 10(b) <i>Charter</i> rights were
    breached because he was not afforded a reasonable opportunity to contact
    counsel of his choice. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant was arrested shortly before 6 p.m. on December 1, 1998 in what
    is described as a “high-risk takedown”. Unmarked police cars boxed in the
    appellant’s vehicle while he was driving, ordered him from the vehicle at
    gunpoint, and handcuffed him while he was kneeling on the street. The appellant
    was turned over to Staff Sergeant Hrab, who accompanied him in a police car
    as he was transported to the police station.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Staff
    Sergeant Hrab began audiotaping what was taking place as soon as he entered
    the police car. He advised the appellant of the charges against him, cautioned
    him and advised him of his right to counsel. In this respect, Staff Sergeant
    Hrab said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It’s my duty to inform you that you have the right
    to retain and instruct counsel without delay. You have the right to telephone,
    in private, any lawyer you wish. You also have the right to free advice,
    in private, from a Legal Aid lawyer. If you are charged with any offence,
    you may apply to the Ontario Legal Aid Plan for legal assistance. The number
    is … and this is a toll free number that will put you in contact with Legal
    Aid Duty Counsel for legal, free legal advice right now. Do you understand?</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant indicated he did not wish to say anything in answer to the charge.
    When asked if he wanted to contact a lawyer, the appellant said yes. When
    asked if he had a particular lawyer in mind, he provided the name “Art Jones” of
    Mackesy, Smye, Grilli and Jones. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant arrived at the police station at about 6:10 p.m. On arrival, he
    was strip searched and placed in an interview room. Staff Sergeant Hrab returned
    to the interview room at about 6:40 p.m. and began assisting the appellant
    with the process of contacting counsel. Soon after Staff Sergeant Hrab entered
    the room, the appellant clarified that his lawyer’s name was Neil Jones.
    Staff Sergeant Hrab located Mr. Jones in the telephone book and, at the appellant’s
    request, dialled the lawyer’s home number. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    Staff Sergeant Hrab was placing a call to Mr. Jones’s home, the appellant
    asked if he got only one call. Although the transcript of the conversation
    indicates Staff Sergeant Hrab responded, “[w]ell uh”, Staff Sergeant Hrab
    testified that he gave a non- verbal response (“mm-hmm”) as he was listening
    to the answering machine, meaning that the appellant was not limited to just
    one call. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Staff
    Sergeant Hrab left a message on Mr. Jones’s home answering machine with his
    name, the time, and the number for the telephone he was using, located in
    the corridor outside the interview room where the appellant was detained.
    Staff Sergeant Hrab then tried Mr. Jones’s office number but got no answer.
    Staff Sergeant Hrab asked the appellant if he would like to call another
    lawyer and the appellant responded “David Smye”. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Staff
    Sergeant Hrab telephoned Mr. Smye’s home number and a woman answered. Staff
    Sergeant Hrab told her that he had a gentleman who wished to speak with Mr.
    Smye or Mr. Jones and asked if she knew how he could reach either of them.
    The woman responded that she did not know. Staff Sergeant Hrab left his name
    and the corridor telephone number. In response to a question, he gave the
    woman the appellant’s name. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Staff
    Sergeant Hrab informed the appellant that Mr. Smye was not home and asked
    if there was anyone else he wished to call. The appellant responded “Pat
    Mackesy”. After checking the directories for various cities, Staff Sergeant
    Hrab placed a call to Mr. Mackesy’s home. The portion of this conversation
    recorded on the audiotape is as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Staff Sergeant Hrab: Mr. Mackesy, it’s Staff Sergeant
    Steve Hrab calling from the Hamilton-Wentworth Regional Police. Uh I’m here
    at Central Police Station with a gentleman by the name of Robert Badgerow.
    Uh he’s presently in our custody and he would like to speak with you. Uh
    if you give us a moment, uh we’ll get out of the room and I’ll give him some
    privacy to talk to you. Alright? Thank you. Hang on for a second. Let us
    get out of the room here and uh close the door and like I say when you’re
    done, just give a rap on the door.</p>

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Staff Sergeant Hrab: Uh, Mr. Mackesy. Hi, yes, who’s

    Mr. Mackesy? Alright. Then that’s it? (short period of silence) Mr. Mackesy?

    after being confronted with the fact that the police had obtained a DNA sample
    from something he had discarded and that his DNA matched the DNA profile
    of the semen found on the deceased’s body, the appellant said he did not
    have an explanation and that it would be up to his lawyer to answer any more
    questions. Although Staff Sergeant Hrab asked him why he made the 911 call,
    the appellant denied making the call and refused to answer further questions.</p>

    he also knew that Mr. Jones had indicated that if the police wished to speak
    to the appellant, they should contact Mr. Jones. Staff Sergeant Hrab denied

    Mr. Mackesy did not recall whether the appellant said he was charged with
    murder. Although Mr. Mackesy believed he told Staff Sergeant Hrab that he
    was going to try to locate Mr. Jones, he was unable to say with absolute
    certainty that he did so. Further, although he did not recall giving the
    appellant any advice, he agreed it was possible that he could have.</p>

    7:30 p.m. on December 1, 1998, soon after arriving home. Mr. Mackesy told
    him the appellant had been arrested and wanted to speak to him. After listening
    to the message from Staff Sergeant Hrab, Mr. Jones called the corridor number
    at the police station but received no answer. He then tried the central police
    station number but was transferred to Staff Sergeant Hrab’s voicemail; he
    left a message and waited for a call back. At around 8:15 p.m., Mr. Jones
    telephoned the police station once again and was eventually put through to
    the appellant. Following a 10- to 15-minute conversation with the appellant,
    Mr. Jones advised Staff Sergeant Hrab that the appellant did not wish to
    make any statements. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge accepted the principle that “[w]hat the police must do or not
    do so far as the exercise of a detainee’s 10(b) rights is concerned depends
    in part upon what the detainee says and does and what the police [know] or
    would readily surmise.” However, based on the foregoing factors, he concluded
    that it was reasonable in the circumstances for Staff Sergeant Hrab to assume
    the appellant had exercised his s. 10(b) rights.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    key portions of the trial judge’s reasons are as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Here Staff Sergeant Hrab, after the accused had
    spoken to Mr. Mackesy, had no way of knowing what had transpired in the brief
    conversation. He asked the accused whether he was happy that he had an opportunity
    to speak with counsel and received an affirmative reply. The fact that the
    accused told Hrab that his instructions to Mackesy were to continue to try
    to get in touch with Neil Jones, tell him what happened, and have him get
    in touch with Hrab does not necessarily indicate that the accused had not
    exercised his right to counsel in speaking with Mr. Mackesy. It could just
    as easily be taken to mean that he still wished to retain Mr. Jones in defence
    of the charges and to consult him in that regard. Similarly, the accused
    asking whether he could make another phone call and being refused does not
    necessarily lead to the conclusion that his right to counsel has been denied,
    because it is not known whom he wished to call in connection with that request.
    It could just as logically have been a request to call, for instance, his
    wife. We do not know the purport of the accused’s statement to Hrab or of
    the question as the accused did not testify on the <i>voir dire</i>. </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I am satisfied, in all the circumstances, that the
    accused had been given a reasonable opportunity to exercise his section 10(b)
    rights to consult counsel of his choice. I find the circumstances of this
    case similar to the facts in <i>R. v. Mayo</i> (1999), 133 C.C.C. (3d) 168
    and find that a similar result should follow.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>On Hrab asking whether the accused was happy that
    he had spoken with counsel and receiving an affirmative answer, it was reasonable
    for him to assume that the accused had exercised his 10(b) rights.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:
normal;page-break-after:avoid;'><b>d) Discussion – s. 10(b) of the <i>Charter</i></b></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the facts of this case, in my view, the trial judge’s reliance on <i>R. v.
    Mayo</i> was misplaced. Moreover, the trial judge’s finding that Staff Sergeant
    Hrab was entitled to assume that the appellant had exercised his s. 10(b) <i>Charter</i> rights
    was unreasonable. On my review of the record, the evidence in this case points
    inevitably to the conclusion that the police breached the appellant’s s.
    10(b) rights by failing to give him a reasonable opportunity to consult counsel
    of his choice and by failing to hold off in questioning him until he had
    been given that opportunity.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>R.
      v. Mayo</i>, the accused was arrested and charged with a second count of
      sexual assault after he had already retained counsel on a previous charge.
      When asked on his arrest for the second charge whether he wanted to contact
      a specific lawyer, the accused expressed a willingness to obtain immediate
      advice from legal aid duty counsel and to hear the allegations before doing
      so. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    the accused spoke to duty counsel, the arresting officer asked, “And are
    you satisfied now that you’ve had proper legal instruction?” The accused
    responded affirmatively. When asked if he wanted to ask any questions, the
    accused said, “[N]ot unless I have legal advice with me.”
    In response to the question, “I’m sure (unintelligible) not coming in though,
    right?”, the accused said, “No, he said he’d get in touch with my other lawyer,
    or get in touch with a lawyer and then go to it from there.” The police officer
    proceeded to question the accused and the trial judge relied on the accused’s
    answers to find that he was not credible.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    accused in <i>Mayo</i> did not raise a s. 10(b) <i>Charter</i> argument at
    trial. On appeal to this court, Rosenberg J.A. said that if the accused had
    asserted his right to speak to the lawyer he had already retained and had
    he not already spoken to legal aid, the police officer would have been obliged
    to hold off in questioning the accused and to provide him with a reasonable
    opportunity to consult counsel. However, because the accused confirmed, in
    response to a direct question, that he had obtained “proper legal instruction”,
    and because the accused was not entitled to have counsel present while he
    was interviewed as he requested, Rosenberg J.A. concluded the police officer
    was not obliged to hold off. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    Rosenberg J.A. indicated at para. 17 that, even if the accused’s request
    to have counsel present was open to two interpretations, the appellant had
    not established a breach of his s. 10(b) <i>Charter</i> rights because he
    did not testify on the <i>voir dire</i> and because “there was no other evidence
    to establish that he was asserting a right to proper legal advice from his
    counsel of choice.” </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my opinion, this case is distinguishable from <i>R. v. Mayo</i> for several
    reasons. Those same reasons point to the conclusion that the trial judge’s
    finding that Staff Sergeant Hrab was entitled to assume that the appellant
    had exercised his s. 10(b) rights was unreasonable. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    I have said, in <i>Mayo</i>, immediately after speaking to legal aid duty
    counsel and in response to a direct question, the accused confirmed that
    he was satisfied that he had obtained “proper legal instruction.”  Further,
    to the extent that the accused’s comments may have been capable of two interpretations,
    there was no other evidence on the <i>voir dire</i> concerning what he intended. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this case, unlike the accused in <i>Mayo</i>, the appellant did not acknowledge
    being satisfied that he had obtained “proper legal instruction”. On the contrary,
    he acknowledged only that he had spoken to a particular lawyer. Significantly,
    both immediately before and immediately after acknowledging that fact, the
    appellant made statements that raised at least the possibility that he had
    not exercised his right to counsel. In addition, the fact that the appellant
    intended to contact Mr. Jones for the purpose of obtaining advice was confirmed
    in this case by the evidence of Mr. Mackesy. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    particular, immediately after speaking to Mr. Mackesy, the appellant said
    the following in response to Staff Sergeant Hrab’s inquiry concerning whether
    the appellant told Mr. Mackesy why he was at the police station:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>My instructions to him were to keep getting in touch,
    if could get in touch with uh Mr. Jones. When he does, advise him of what’s

    my opinion, six factors point to the conclusion that the only reasonable
    interpretation of the appellant’s comment was that he was still trying to
    obtain advice from Mr. Jones:</p>

    appellant made this statement in response to a question from Staff Sergeant
    Hrab concerning whether he told Mr. Mackesy why he was at the police station;
    and</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:Wingdings;'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    appellant made this statement only minutes after Staff Sergeant Hrab had
    left a similar message for Mr. Jones to call Staff Sergeant Hrab. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    a minimum, the appellant’s comment raised an issue concerning whether the
    appellant was still seeking assistance from Mr. Jones and required Staff
    Sergeant Hrab to clarify that issue. However, rather than asking a specific
    question, such as the question asked in <i>R. v. Mayo</i>,<i> </i>to clarify
    the appellant’s intention in that regard, Staff Sergeant Hrab asked a question
    calling for an obvious response that did not provide the necessary clarification: </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;'>But you are happy that you
    have had that, an opportunity to speak with counsel now? </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Given
    that the appellant had spoken to Mr. Mackesy, the only possible answers to
    this question were either yes or yes with some form of question or explanation.
    Although the appellant’s immediate answer was yes, he followed it up almost
    immediately with an inquiry concerning whether he could make a further telephone
    call. In these circumstances, in my view, the trial judge’s conclusion that
    Staff Sergeant Hrab was entitled to assume that the appellant had exercised
    his right to counsel is unreasonable. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is well established that the police have both informational and implementation
    duties in relation to s. 10(b) of the <i>Charter</i>. Where an accused asks
    to speak to a particular lawyer on arrest or detention, the police are obliged
    to give the accused a reasonable opportunity to exercise his or her right
    to counsel of choice and to hold off in questioning the accused so long as
    the accused is reasonably diligent in exercising the right: see, for example, <i>R
    v. Bartle</i> (1994), 92 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (S.C.C.); <i>R. v. Manninen</i> (1987),
    34 C.C.C. (3d) 385 (S.C.C.).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    the trial judge noted, there is also ample authority that what the police
    are required to say and do in a particular case to fulfill their duties under
    s. 10(b) will depend on what the accused says and does and what the police
    could reasonably surmise in the circumstances: see, for example, <i>R. v.
    Ross</i> (1989), 46 C.C.C. (3d) 129 (S.C.C.); <i>R. v. Tremblay</i> (1987),
    37 C.C.C. (3d) 565 (S.C.C.); <i>R. v. Top</i> (1989), 48 C.C.C. (3d) 493
    (Alta. C.A.).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although
    the police cannot be expected to be mind readers, they are not entitled to
    ignore statements by an accused that raise a reasonable prospect that the
    accused has not exercised his or her s. 10(b) rights. Rather, where an accused
    makes such a statement, the police must be diligent in ensuring that an accused
    has a reasonable opportunity to exercise his or her rights, and may not rely
    on answers to ambiguous questions as a basis for assuming that an accused
    has exercised his or her rights. </p>

    the facts of this case, in my view, the exchange between the appellant and
    Staff Sergeant Hrab points clearly to the inference that the appellant had
    not exercised his right to counsel of choice and was still seeking assistance
    from his own lawyer. Moreover, the fact that the appellant had been subjected
    to a high-risk takedown within the past hour was a relevant consideration
    for Staff Sergeant Hrab to bear in mind in interpreting the appellant’s comments.
    At a minimum, the foregoing exchange required that Staff Sergeant Hrab obtain
    explicit confirmation concerning whether the appellant had exercised his
    right to counsel of choice before questioning him.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    was not a situation where there was any urgency in the police interviewing
    the appellant. The offence was many years old and there was no evidence of
    any pressing issues requiring an immediate interrogation. Given this context,
    it was not unreasonable for the appellant to ask for a further opportunity
    to contact his counsel of choice.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    unlike <i>R. v. Mayo</i>, in this case there was evidence on the <i>voir
    dire</i> concerning the appellant’s intentions. Although Mr. Mackesy was
    unsure in his evidence about various details of his brief conversation with
    the appellant, he was quite clear in stating that the appellant wanted him
    to find Mr. Jones and to have Mr. Jones get in touch with the appellant.
    Further, although the trial judge seemed to attach some significance to Mr.
    Mackesy’s inability to swear that he had not advised the appellant to remain
    silent, Mr. Mackesy was also clear in indicating that he did not perceive
    his role as being to give advice to the appellant. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, the possibility that Mr. Mackesy may have told the appellant not
    to say anything is irrelevant to the issue of whether the appellant’s s.
    10(b) rights were breached. The right to seek advice from counsel of choice
    on arrest or detention is not limited to receiving perfunctory advice to
    keep quiet. Rather, it entitles an accused to obtain sufficiently meaningful
    advice to enable him or her to make an informed choice concerning whether
    to exercise his or her right to silence: see <i>R. v. Hebert</i> (1990),
    57 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.). </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Even
    if Mr. Mackesy volunteered brief advice to the appellant along the lines
    of keep quiet, the appellant was well within his rights to continue to assert
    his right to consult counsel of his choice and to enlist Mr. Mackesy’s help
    in finding him. In all of the circumstances, in my view, Staff Sergeant Hrab
    breached the appellant’s s. 10(b) rights by interviewing the appellant before
    giving him a reasonable opportunity to consult with counsel of his choice.</p>

    his ruling, the trial judge went on to make an alternative finding that even
    if the appellant’s s. 10(b) <i>Charter</i> right was breached, the appellant’s
    statement to the police should not be excluded under s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.
    The trial judge focussed on the question of the seriousness of the breach,
    found Staff Sergeant Hrab had acted in good faith, and concluded that the

    appellant’s statement to the police was conscriptive evidence within the
    meaning of <i>R. v. Stillman</i> (1997), 113 C.C.C. (3d) 321 (S.C.C.). In <i>Stillman</i>,
    at para. 73, Cory J. said the admission of conscriptive evidence will “generally
    tend to render the trial unfair.” Although subsequent courts have indicated
    that a finding that evidence is conscriptive does not create an automatic
    rule of exclusion (see, for example, <i>R. v. Elias</i>; <i>R. v. Orbanski</i> (2005),
    196 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (S.C.C.); <i>R. v. Grant</i> (2006), 209 C.C.C. (3d)
    250 (Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. granted [2007] S.C.C.A. No. 99),
    I see nothing in this case that would diminish the deleterious effects of
    the breach on trial fairness. </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Because
    the appellant was not afforded a reasonable opportunity to consult with counsel
    of his choice prior to making a statement to the police, he was deprived
    of the opportunity to obtain proper advice that would have allowed him to
    make an informed choice about whether to speak to the police. This is not
    a case in which it is obvious that the appellant was intent on making a statement;
    nor is it a case in which the reliability of the conscriptive evidence somehow
    obviates the impact on trial fairness of admitting the statement. </p>

    assuming that the trial judge’s finding of police good faith would remain
