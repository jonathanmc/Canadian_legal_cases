    case arises out of an action brought by Jack contesting the validity of a
    provision in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Cam’s Will that bequeaths his shares in the family business to Cheryl. The
    trial judge ruled in favour of Jack, and Cheryl appeals the judgment in her
    personal capacity. Both Bing and Donny, represented by Bing, were defendants
    to Jack’s action. Donny’s position at trial was based on a proposed settlement
    with Cheryl, which the trial judge declined to approve on the basis that
    the settlement would improperly provide Cheryl with benefits contrary to
    her fiduciary duties to Donny, both as a trustee to Donny and as estate trustee
    with respect to Donny’s beneficial interest in Cam’s Will. The trial judge’s
    refusal to approve the proposed settlement was not questioned on appeal.
    Donny, represented by Bing, now opposes Cheryl’s appeal and supports Jack’s
    position as respondent, but remains opposed to Jack’s intended cross-appeal
    of the trial judge’s costs order. Cheryl and Todd Burns, as the estate trustees,
    have made submissions as respondents on the cross-appeal only.</p>

    of the Frye siblings entered into a shareholders’
    agreement in June 1991. At that time, their father was still alive and held
    shares in the company, but he was incompetent and Canada Trust had been appointed
    to act on his behalf. One of the agreement’s purposes was to remove Canada
    Trust, and Canada Trust declined to sign this agreement on the elder Frye’s
    behalf. At the end of February 1994, after the Frye siblings had inherited
    all of their father’s shares, they signed a unanimous agreement that amended

    and that it was unnecessary to resort to extrinsic evidence. After a careful
    reading of the agreement as a whole, he concluded that the words referring
    to the transfer of shares were broad enough to apply to a transfer by testamentary
    disposition. He found that

    trial judge interpreted the share transfer restrictions in the shareholders’ agreement
    and the company’s letters patent as broad enough to apply to a transfer by
    testamentary disposition. The trial judge then reasoned that to give effect
    to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Cam’s contractual commitments, which also bind his estate, it was necessary
    to find that his specific bequest of his shares to Cheryl was null and void.</p>

line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree that the shareholders’ agreement and the letters patent apply to a

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    on a conceptual level, contractual obligations do not constrain a person’s
    ability to bequeath property by means of a will. For example, a contractual
    obligation to make or to refrain from revoking a will gives rise to an action
    for breach of contract and does not affect the validity of the will itself:
    see A.H. Oosterhoff, <i>Oosterhoff on Wills and Succession</i>, 6th ed. (Toronto:
    Thomson
    <st1:PersonName w:st="on">
    Carswell, 2007) at 126–27. The trial judge concluded that “Cameron Frye was
    bound by the provisions of the Shareholders’ Agreement as amended and had
    no right to transfer by his Will shares in the corporation to his sister
    Cheryl.”  Cameron Frye may have been bound by the provisions of the Shareholders’ Agreement,
    but his right to bequeath his shares was entirely another matter. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the trial judge was not made aware of s. 67(2) of the <i>Business Corporations
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. B.16, and did not consider its effect. Section 67(2)
    expressly contemplates corporate articles and shareholders’ agreements that
    restrict the transfer of shares. It provides that a corporation shall treat “the
    executor, administrator, estate trustee, heir<a href="#_ftn1"

    any event, there is no basis for finding the specific bequest to be null

    out of the estate to Cheryl without complying with the requirements of the

    argues that Cheryl, by taking the position that
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    Cam’s specific bequest of shares to her was valid, is acting inconsistently
    with her fiduciary duties to Donny. His argument asserts that Cheryl’s position
    inappropriately prefers her economic interests over those of Donny, as its
    success would have the effect of denying Donny, as a residual legatee, 25%
    of the proceeds of the sale of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Cam’s shares that would result from the bequest’s failure. Bing, on behalf
    of Donny, made submissions on appeal in support of Jack’s position. </p>

    do not accept this argument. It conflates two very different matters. Cheryl
    is both an individual and a trustee. As an individual, she is entitled to
    receive gifts, including a gift of shares from
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    Cam. She is permitted to protect that right through recourse to the legal
    system. If her pursuit of her personal rights is seen to conflict with her
    fiduciary obligations, the appropriate course of action is for the other
    trustees to act or seek directions to deal with the matter. Such action does
    not, however, bear any relevance to the validity of Cam’s bequest, since
    neither Cheryl’s fiduciary duties nor her fulfilment or breach of them can
    change the analysis concerning the bequest’s validity: legal title to the
    shares is transmitted to the estate trustees by operation of law, who hold
    them in trust for her as a donee pursuant to Cam’s Will. </p>
