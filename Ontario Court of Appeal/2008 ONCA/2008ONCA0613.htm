  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown appeals from the Ontario Review Board’s (“ORB”) decision granting  Ms.
    Li an absolute discharge. The Crown submits the ORB erred in law in holding,
    at paras. 20 and 21 of its reasons, that the Centre for Addiction and Mental
    Health (“CAMH”) had an onus on it to demonstrate that Ms. Li was not a significant
    risk to the safety of the public. We agree: see <i>Winko</i> <i>v. Forensic
    Psychiatric Institute </i>(1999), 135
    C.C.C. (3d) 129 (S.C.C.), at paras. 54 - 55.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown further submits that this error affected the Board’s chain of reasoning
    and led to an unreasonable result. The Crown’s position may be summarized
    as follows. Ms. Li’s attempt to seize a police officer’s gun posed a significant
    risk not only to herself but to the public because of the possibility of
    the unintentional discharge of the gun. The same psycho-social stressors
    that led to both Ms. Li’s impulsive behaviour and her lack of insight into
    her mental condition continue to exist. As a result, in the Crown’s submission,
    she continues to pose a risk of harm to the public. The evidence of Dr. Flett,
    Ms. Li’s attending psychiatrist, was that Ms. Li’s lack of insight into her
    illness and methods for stabilizing it meant that when acting on a suicidal
    impulse she may put other people at risk. She also has a long history of
    failing to take her medication.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    its reasons the ORB noted Ms. Li’s evidence that she had not given up on
    attempting suicide, but that, in the future, she would not use a method that
    put others at risk. The ORB held, at para. 18, “that whatever might flow
    from her private suicidal ideation there was not the slightest real current
    chance of her putting any member of the public at risk.”  This statement
    is not only without evidentiary foundation and utterly speculative, but is
    contrary to the only expert evidence on point.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is the nature of Ms. Li’s particular illness that puts the public at risk.
    When questioned whether she believed Ms. Li continued to pose a significant
    risk to the public, Dr. Flett responded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I do. I do in that the behaviour for which her
    index offence flows from and continues on in her impulsive acts and her suicidality
    which has increased over the past two months specifically.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Dr. Flett stated earlier
    in her evidence:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I think the greatest concern currently with Ms.
    Li is her level of suicidality and impulsivity that’s related to that. She
    had quite a lethal attempt a couple of weeks ago and it was very similar
    behaviour at the time of her index offence that led to that offence and so
    certainly her suicidality, impulsivity and the activity in which she can
    become affectively and emotionally aroused when she’s faced with a disappointment
    or loss if they are significant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    ORB was of the view that the attending psychiatrist, Dr. Flett, and the clinical
    team at CAMH placed substantial reliance on the episode that generated the
    NCR finding and on a previous occasion when in the course of an episode of
    marital discord with her ex-husband she also reached for a police officer’s
    gun. It was not the episodes themselves which concerned Dr. Flett, but rather
    the behaviour that preceded these incidents and caused Ms. Li to act as she
    did. That behaviour continues to date and has not improved.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    ORB’s reasons do not reflect a consideration of whether the appellant’s underlying
    mental illness, continued lack of insight into her condition and impulsiveness
    demonstrate a propensity to <i>unintentionally</i> to put members of the
    public risk. Whether or not Ms. Li <i>intends</i> to cause the public harm
    is irrelevant particularly where her conduct <i>in fact</i> puts the public
    at risk.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    ORB also commented that on the two prior occasions when Ms. Li had attempted
    to seize a police officer’s gun “on no such occasion was an officer at any
    real risk and subject to any aggressive conduct or threats.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the initial hearing there was an obligation on the ORB to inquire whether
    the victim of a criminal offence has been notified of their right to attend
    a hearing, present a statement and make a statement. If not, the ORB may
    exercise its discretion to adjourn the hearing for up to 14 days to obtain
    the statement. The list of exhibits presented to this Court does not indicate
    that notice was given. In the circumstances, where the onus is on the ORB
    to review all relevant evidence (see para. 54 of <i>Winko</i>), it is incumbent
    on the Board to search this evidence out rather than make assumptions without
    any evidentiary foundation. The ORB erred in making such assumptions in this
    case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    ORB also erred in holding that there was an onus on CAMH to prove Ms. Li
    posed a significant risk to the public, and that this onus had not been met
    (para. 21 of the ORB’s reasons). The Supreme Court of Canada has decided
    that there is no burden or onus on any party (see<i> </i>paras. 49 and 54
    of <i>Winko</i>) and accordingly the Board erred in placing a burden of proof
    on CAMH to show that Ms. Li posed a significant risk.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    uncontradicted evidence before the ORB was that the psychiatric illnesses  precipitating
    Ms. Li’s index offence continue relatively unabated. Ms. Li is non-compliant
    in terms of attending appointments with her attending psychiatrist at CAMH
    and taking her medication. She has no insight into her illness or the potential
    harm her actions may cause to others.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, the Board’s finding that the respondent was not a significant
    threat to the safety of the public is unreasonable and its order granting
    Ms. Li. an absolute discharge is set aside. Given its conclusion that Ms.
    Li should be absolutely discharged, the Board did not engage in any analysis
    as to the least onerous and least restrictive disposition possible. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    matter is therefore remitted to a fresh Review Board to consider the case
    in accordance with these reasons.</p>
