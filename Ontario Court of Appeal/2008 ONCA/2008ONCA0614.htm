      a joint trial before Grossi J. sitting with a jury, the appellants Latcha
      and Watson were each convicted of robbery while armed with a handgun and
      of possession of a loaded restricted firearm. Both appellants were sentenced
      to five years’ imprisonment less credit for pre-sentence custody on the
      armed robbery charge (“count 1”) and to two years’
    imprisonment concurrent on the possession charge (“count 2”). The appellants
    appeal their convictions and seek leave to appeal their sentences.</span></p>

      was common ground at trial that a third individual, Smith, was in physical
      possession of a loaded handgun during the incident forming the subject
      matter of the charges, which occurred at a clothing store. Smith died as
      the result of injuries sustained in a confrontation with the storeowner.
      Evidence at the trial indicated that the storeowner was a drug dealer and
      may have been using the clothing store as a front for his drug trafficking
      operation. </span></p>

      relation to the conviction appeal, both appellants submit that the trial
      judge failed to give an adequate <i>Vetrovec</i> instruction. In addition,
      Latcha contends that the jury charge was unbalanced. Concerning count 1,
      Latcha argues that the trial judge erred by failing to instruct the jury
      that to be guilty of armed robbery, the accused had to know that the use
      of a firearm was a probable consequence of the offence. Watson submits
      that the party-to-the-offence instructions were fatally flawed in relation
      to count 1 because the trial judge failed to make it clear to the jury
      that in order to convict they had to be satisfied that Watson participated
      in a theft at a time when he knew that Smith was armed with a firearm.  Concerning
      count 2, both appellants contend that their conviction on count 2 was unreasonable.
      In addition, they argue that the trial judge failed to properly instruct
      the jury on the essential elements of count 2. </span></p>

      to count 1. I would allow the conviction appeals in relation to count 2,
      set aside the convictions, and order a new trial. Although I would grant
      leave to appeal sentence to both appellants, I would dismiss their sentence
      appeals.</span></p>

      neither appellant testified at trial, both acknowledged their presence
      at the scene in videotaped statements taken by the police, which the Crown
      introduced into evidence at trial. In their statements, both appellants
      took the position that Smith was the main actor in the incident, that he
      had some form of dispute with the storeowner, and that there was no common
      plan to commit a robbery. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

      essentially acknowledged in his videotaped statement that he realized that
      a robbery was going to occur after Smith purchased some garbage bags and
      gloves just before entering the clothing store and that he decided not
      to leave and have the other two men think he was a coward. In addition,
      he acknowledged that he closed the front door of the store on Smith’s signal;
      that at some point he realized that his role was going to be to fill up
      the garbage bags; and that Smith had shown him his gun and some bullets
      a month or two earlier. Although he said that Smith “never walks around
      without [the gun]” and “knowin’ Smith, I know Smith has somethin’ on him”,
      Latcha claimed he did not see a gun that day and did not turn his mind
      to whether Smith had a gun. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

      also said that Smith and Watson pushed the storeowner into the backroom
      and that, before entering the backroom, Smith told Watson and him to take
      everything. Latcha said Watson was trying to open a bag and put stuff in,
      but that he felt paralyzed when he heard fighting in the backroom and did
      not take anything. He said he dropped the bag he was holding and was running
      out the door when the storeowner emerged from the backroom bleeding and
      with a metal pipe in his hands. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

      claimed in his statement that he had only known Smith for a couple of months
      and that he had never seen him with a gun. Although he acknowledged that
      he “kinda figured it out” as events were unfolding, he maintained that
      he did not know in advance that a robbery was going to take place, and
      that he only realized that Smith had a gun when he saw him pull it out.
      He said the gun was a two-two, or a four or five, and that he thought the
      words “Smith and Wesson” were printed on it.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Watson
      said he tried to push Smith and the storeowner apart after Smith pulled
      the gun, but that Latcha and Smith pushed the storeowner into a back room.
      When Latcha came out of the backroom, he dropped some garbage bags and
      told Watson to pick them up. Although Watson acknowledged picking up the
      garbage bags, he said that he was in shock, that he dropped them as he
      left, that he did not take anything from the store and that he “didn’t
      want nuttin’ to do with it.” He explained that he essentially froze while
      Smith and the storeowner fought in the back room for about three to five
      minutes and then ran from the store when the storeowner emerged from the
      back room holding a long item shaped like a bat made of hard plastic or
      metal.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>According
      to the storeowner, following some initial conversation after the three
      men entered the store, Smith told him to back up. He heard something click,
      like the cocking of a gun, and Watson yelled, “Don’t shoot.” All three
      men pushed him into the backroom of the store and he was hit on the head
      with a blunt object. Then the storeowner and Smith became embroiled in
      a fight. The storeowner grabbed a metal pipe and hit Smith with it twice. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>When
      the storeowner emerged from the backroom, he saw both appellants bending
      over putting clothing into garbage bags. Latcha was on the north side of
      the store and Watson was on the south side. The two men ran from the store
      and the storeowner followed them, and then asked someone to call the police.
      The storeowner returned to the backroom and found the gun. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      his initial statement to the police, the storeowner denied there was a
      gun involved in the incident. Although he was later able to retrieve the
      gun and had his lawyer turn it over to the police, he claimed at trial
      that he could not identify the customer to whom he gave it. A police officer
      testified that based on the injuries Smith sustained, in his view, Smith
      must have been struck more often than twice.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Among
      other things, the police found a black garbage bag with two pairs of jeans
      partially inserted into it on the north side of the store where Latcha
      was standing; packaging for garbage bags that had been ripped open and
      a garbage bag on the south side of the store; and two pairs of jeans on
      the floor behind the counter of the store. </span></p>

      police also found cocaine in the backroom of the store. The storeowner
      testified that it was a small amount and acknowledged selling it on the
      side. However, he denied dealing from the store, and denied that Smith
      entered the store because the two were involved together in the drug trade.
      In cross-examination, the storeowner conceded that the police found cocaine
      in the store along with an electronic scale and baggies. The storeowner
      confirmed that trafficking charges were pending against him at the time
      of the appellants’ trial and that he planned to plead not guilty. </span></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
      reject the appellants’ submissions that the trial judge’s <i>Vetrovec</i> instruction
      amounted to reversible error. In my opinion, the trial judge’s instruction
      to the jury to use “the greatest care and caution” in assessing the storeowner’s
      evidence was sufficient in the circumstances of this case. This was not
      a situation where the Crown’s case depended solely on the evidence of the
      storeowner. Further, the storeowner was not the type of witness, <i>i.e.</i> an
      informant or an accomplice, that has traditionally raised the greatest
      concerns about the need for caution in assessing the witness’s evidence.
      Given these circumstances, I would not interfere with the trial judge’s
      exercise of discretion concerning the appropriate wording of the caution.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Further,
      although I agree that the trial judge could have referred to factors in
      addition to the storeowner’s admission that he was a drug dealer to explain
      the need for caution in relation to his evidence, in my opinion such factors
      would have been obvious to the jury in this case in any event. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For
      example, I consider that it would have been obvious to the jury that the
      storeowner lied in his initial statement to the police when he denied there
      was a gun involved in the incident and that he lied in his evidence at
      trial when he claimed that he could not identify the customer to whom he
      gave the gun. The trial judge cautioned the jury to “beware of the witness
      you find that has lied to you in one area” in his instruction to the jury
      about partisan witnesses.  In these circumstances, it would have been obvious
      to this jury that they should be cautious about the storeowner’s evidence
      as a result of his lies.   </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Further,
      the trial judge told the jury in a separate instruction that they should
      approach the evidence of the storeowner with care and caution due to the
      fact that he was awaiting trial on outstanding charges and explained specifically
      that a witness in that position might believe that it would be in his interest
      to provide favourable testimony. Moreover, I have no doubt that the jury
      would have appreciated that the storeowner would have an interest in justifying
      in his testimony his role in Smith’s death. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
      note that defence counsel at trial (not Mr. Hicks or Mr. Harris) did not
      mention any factors other than the storeowner’s drug dealing activities
      in requesting that a <i>Vetrovec</i> instruction be given, nor did they
      advance any specific objections to this aspect of the trial judge’s charge.
      In all of the circumstances, I am not satisfied that the trial judge erred
      in failing to refer to additional factors to explain the need for caution
      in relation to the storeowner’s evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellants also submit that the trial judge erred in the examples he gave
      of evidence capable of confirming the storeowner’s testimony. I agree that
      the fact that the storeowner admitted lying to the police about the gun
      was not capable of confirming his evidence. However, the gun and the evidence
      concerning drugs were capable of restoring the jury’s faith in his credibility.
      In any event, there was abundant evidence in the appellants’
    own statements that confirmed much of the storeowner’s testimony. I am satisfied
    that the appellants suffered no prejudice from this somewhat confusing direction. </span></p>

      Although the trial judge did not review the appellants’
    positions when setting out the various modes of liability advanced by the
    Crown, it was unnecessary that he do so. The trial judge had canvassed the

      reject Latcha’s submission that the trial judge was required to instruct
      the jury that in order to find the appellants guilty of armed robbery,
      the jury had to be satisfied that the appellants knew that use of a firearm
      was a probable consequence of the offence. In my opinion, Latcha’s reliance

      were charged with robbery under s. 343(d) of the<i> Criminal Code,</i> in
      which “use” of a firearm is not an essential element of the offence. Rather,
      s. 343(d) refers to being “armed” with an offensive weapon. Accordingly,
      it was sufficient in this case that the accused were aware that Smith was
      armed with an offensive weapon, which was particularized in this case as

      claims that the trial judge committed reversible error in his instructions
      to the jury on parties in relation to count 1 because he failed to tell
      the jury that in order to find the appellants liable as secondary parties,
      the Crown was required to prove that: i) the appellants knew that Smith
      had a gun, and, ii) the appellants did something to participate in a theft
      at a time when they knew that Smith had a gun. Instead, the trial judge
      told the jury that possession of the gun was an essential element of robbery,
      but never provided the jury with a clear explanation concerning how they
      could make a finding that the appellants were in possession of the gun. </span></p>

      Watson contends that the jury’s questions demonstrate that they may have

      moreover, that they may have been working backwards from count 2 to count
      1 to try and resolve their difficulties.  </span></p>

      he saw him pull it out, Watson claims that there is a risk that the jury
      relied on his conduct prior to Smith pulling the gun to make a finding
      that he participated in count 1. He submits that the trial judge erred
      by failing to instruct the jury clearly in his recharge that they could
      only convict on count 1 if they were satisfied that the appellants each

      the trial judge failed to instruct the jury that, before making a finding

      I agree that the trial judge’s instructions and recharge could have been
      clearer, I am satisfied that they were adequate to ensure that the jury

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First,
      I consider that it would have been obvious to the jury, based on the aiding

      knew Smith had a gun. </span></p>

      instructing the jury on aiding and abetting, both in his charge and in
      his recharge, the trial judge stated repeatedly that actual assistance
      (or actual encouragement by acts or conduct) is necessary, that aiding
      (and abetting) relates to a specific offence, and that the aider (or abettor)
      must intend to help (or encourage) the other person commit the offence. </span></p>

      the instruction that actual assistance (or encouragement) is necessary
      and that mere presence is not enough, the jury would necessarily have understood
      that in order to be guilty of count 1, they had to find that a particular
      appellant actually did something (such as pick up garbage bags) to assist
      (or encourage) commission of the offence. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Further,
      in my view, the repeated instruction that aiding (and abetting) must relate
      to a specific offence is significant. In the face of the instructions that
      aiding (and abetting) relate to a specific offence, and that the aider
      (or abettor) must intend to help or encourage the other person to commit
      the offence, it would have been obvious to the jury that in order to intend
      to assist (or encourage) an armed robbery, the particular appellant had
      to know the person they intended to assist was armed. </span></p>

      I am not persuaded that either the jury’s first question, or the trial
      judge’s answer to it, create any realistic possibility that the jury may
      have concluded that they could convict the appellants on count 1 based
      on a finding that the appellants had done no more than knowingly assist
      or encourage a mere theft. Even if the question reflects a possibility
      that the jury was working through the elements of the offence, the language
      the jury used in their first question, by itself, strongly supports this
      conclusion. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

      noted above, in setting out the elements of the offence of robbery, the
      trial judge framed the first element as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><span lang=EN-US>Did Mr.
      Watson and/or Mr. Latcha steal something from [the storeowner]?</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><span lang=EN-US>[C]an a

'><span lang=EN-US>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      my view, the jury’s use of the term “robbery” is a strong indication that
      the jury clearly understood that, in order to convict the appellants on
      count 1, they had to find that the appellants intended to aid or abet an
      armed robbery, which was the only form of robbery left with them, as opposed
      to a simple theft. Because the trial judge ruled that the Crown had particularized
      count 1 as armed robbery, throughout his charge he often used the term
      robbery as a short way of referring to the offence as charged, namely,
      armed robbery. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>So,
      for example, the trial judge told the jury that in order to prove robbery
      the Crown had to prove that “Mr. Watson and/or Mr. Latcha were armed with
      an offensive weapon at the time of the stealing.” In addition, the trial
      judge specifically instructed the jury that if they were not satisfied
      beyond a reasonable doubt that “Mr. Latcha and/or Mr. Watson was armed
      with an offensive weapon at the time he stole from [the store owner]”,
      they must find the appellant “not guilty of robbery, but guilty of theft.” </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Considered
      in the context of the trial judge’s description of the first element of
      the offence of robbery by reference to stealing and the trial judge’s use
      of the term robbery as meaning “armed robbery”, the jury’s reference to “robbery” when
      asking a question related to the first element of the offence is a strong
      indication that they were clearly focused on the conduct necessary to aid
      or abet an armed robbery.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However,
      even if the jury was using the term robbery more colloquially as meaning
      theft or stealing, the trial judge’s answer to the jury’s question would
      have made it quite clear that, before they could convict the appellants
      on count 1 based on aiding or abetting, the jury had to find not only that
      the appellants actually did something to assist or encourage a theft, but
      also that the appellants intended to aid or encourage the offence with
      which the appellants were charged, namely, armed robbery. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As
      I have already explained, this is because the trial judge made it clear
      in his instructions that aiding and abetting relate to a specific offence
      and that the aider or abettor must intend to assist or encourage another
      person in committing the offence.  Accordingly, even if the jury’s first
      question was aimed at clarifying the type of conduct that could amount
      to aiding or abetting the act of stealing, the trial judge’s instructions
      made it clear that the aiding or abetting had to relate to the specific
      offence charged, namely, armed robbery.</span></p>

      to the extent that the jury’s first question may indicate they were working
      through the elements of the offence, the jury still had to go on to consider
      the second element, namely, “[w]ere Mr. Latcha and/or Mr. Watson armed
      with an offensive weapon at the time of the stealing?”</span></p>

      third reason for concluding that the trial judge’s instructions were adequate
      is that even if the jury’s second question indicates that they were working
      backwards from count 2 to resolve a difficulty with the concept of possession,
      it would have been clear to the jury, based on the aiding and abetting
      instructions, that they could not find that Watson was in possession of
      the handgun unless they were satisfied that Watson knew that Smith had
      the handgun and intended to at least encourage Smith in possessing the
      handgun. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

      I have said, because the instructions indicate that aiding and abetting
      must relate to a specific offence and also that the aider or abettor must
      intend to assist or encourage the offence, it would have been obvious to
      the jury that in order to find that the appellants were parties to possession
      of the handgun, they had to find that the appellants knew that Smith had
      the handgun and also that the appellants did something to, at a minimum,
      encourage his possession, such as remaining in the store or picking up
      garbage bags. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      my view, a conclusion that the appellants were parties to possession of
      the handgun would have lead inevitably to a finding that they were parties
      to armed robbery. Even assuming the jury was working backwards from count
      2 to resolve a concern about the concept of possession, once the jury found
      that the appellants knew that Smith had a handgun and, at a minimum did
      something to encourage his possession, the jury would inevitably have concluded
      that that conduct and the appellants’ subsequent actions were in furtherance
      of the robbery.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

      am satisfied that it is implicit in the jury’s verdict that they rejected
      Watson’s evidence that he froze after picking up the garbage bags and I
      would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</span></p>

      my opinion, there was evidence capable of supporting convictions against
      both appellants on count 2. With respect to Latcha, this evidence included
      his admitted knowledge of Smith’s habit of carrying a gun, and his statement
      that Smith had shown him the gun and the bullets a month or two earlier.
      With respect to Watson, the evidence included his statement describing
      the caliber and make of the gun and the storeowner’s evidence that he heard
      Watson say, “Don’t shoot.”</span></p>

    the convictions on count 2 must be quashed in relation to both appellants.
    As I have said, the trial judge instructed the jury that findings of guilt
    on count 1 must necessarily lead to findings of guilt on count 2. This instruction
    was in error. Count 2 required that the trial judge give the jury instructions
    on additional elements of that offence that were not included as part of
    the instructions on count 1. <span
lang=EN-US>These</span> additional instructions would have addressed the requirement
    for knowledge that the firearm was loaded as well as instructions concerning
    joint and constructive possession.  As these instructions were not given,
    the convictions against both appellants on count 2 are set aside and a new
    trial is ordered.</p>

      sentence, Latcha argues that since the trial judge relied on the fact that
      the handgun was loaded as a significant aggravating factor on count 1,
      the sentence on count 1 should be reduced if Latcha is acquitted on count
      2. In the alternative, relying on <i>R. v. Borde</i> (2003), 172 C.C.C.
      (3d) 225 (Ont. C.A.), Latcha submits that the trial judge erred in principle
      in imposing a lengthy penitentiary sentence without considering Latcha’s
      youth as a mitigating factor. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'><span lang=EN-US>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
      do not accept these submissions. The trial judge listed seven factors that
      he considered aggravating in relation to sentence. In describing one of
      those factors, he said the following: “[T]he robbery involved a weapon:
      a loaded firearm. A bullet was discharged and found at the scene.”  Further,
      in declining to impose only the minimum sentence for using a firearm in
      the commission of a robbery, the trial judge said: </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><span lang=EN-US>Given Watson
      and Latcha’s prior records, the presence of a loaded firearm, and the epidemic
      of gun possession and used firearms in society, I am of the view that in
      order to adequately respond to the necessary objectives of denunciation
      and deterrence in this case, the minimum sentence is not appropriate.</span></p>

      my view, the trial judge’s statements accurately describes an aggravating
      feature of the offence, whether or not Latcha knew Smith’s handgun was
      loaded. Although there may be some difference in Latcha’s moral blameworthiness
      depending on whether he actually knew the gun was loaded or simply failed
      to make inquiries, I consider the difference slight. Latcha chose to participate
      in a robbery knowing Smith had a gun and having seen the bullets on a previous
      occasion. In fact, the gun was loaded. The trial judge was entitled to
      rely on the presence of a loaded gun as an aggravating feature on count
      1.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

      on the facts of this case, I am not persuaded that the trial judge erred
      in failing to identify Latcha’s youth as a specific mitigating factor or
      in relying on the sentencing objectives of denunciation and deterrence
      as one of the reasons for increasing the sentence on count 1 beyond the
      minimum. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;

      the trial judge did not include Latcha’s youth in his list of mitigating
      factors, during the course of his reasons, he did refer to the fact that
      Latcha was 22 at the time of sentencing. In addition, as the trial judge
      noted, the circumstances of the robbery were extremely serious </span>– <span lang=EN-US>they
      included a robbery committed in a public place during daylight hours, the
      presence of a loaded firearm, and the loss of a life </span>– <span
lang=EN-US>and Latcha’s youth record included a previous finding of guilt for
      robbery. Despite an offender’s youth, the sentence imposed must still be
      proportionate to the gravity of the offence: See <i>R. v. Tan</i></span><span

      He claims that s. 344 divides the offence of robbery into robbery <i>simpliciter</i>,
      which has no minimum punishment, and robbery using a firearm, which attracts
      a minimum sentence of four years’ imprisonment. He says that the higher
      form of robbery must be specifically pleaded and that any other result
      violates his right to be tried by a jury under s. 11(f) of the <i>Charter</i>.
      Watson submits that the trial judge’s error skewed the sentencing process
      and that absent a finding by the jury that he used a firearm during the

    a firearm was an essential element of the offence, s. 343 describes the single
    offence of robbery, which can be committed in a number of different ways.
    Use of a firearm is not an essential element of any of the ways described.
    Once an offence as described in s. 343 has been proven, the accused is, in
    the opening words of s. 344, guilty of “an indictable offence.” It is then
    for the trial judge to impose sentence in accordance with paragraph (a) or

    trial judge must make any such finding on the basis of the standard of proof
    beyond a reasonable doubt: s. 724(3)(e). Because s. 344(a) addresses the
    punishment to be imposed, rather than proof of an offence, as with other

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>The reference to s. 344(a)
    in the charge was unnecessary, in the sense that proof of the use of a firearm,

    Proof that a firearm was used is relevant to the question of sentence only.

  <p class=MsoFootnoteText>(a) while committing or attempting to commit an indictable
    offence</p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText>…</p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText>whether or not he causes or means to cause bodily

  <p class=MsoFootnoteText>(c) in the case of a first offence under this subsection,
    except as provided in paragraph (d), for not more than fourteen years and
    not less than one year;</p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText>…</p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText>In <i>Krug v. The Queen</i> (1985), 21 C.C.C. (3d)
    193 (S.C.C.), the Supreme Court of Canada held that an accused could properly
    be convicted under both the predecessor to s. 343(d) of the<i> Criminal Code</i> and
    s. 83 without offending the<i> Kienapple</i> principle or s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>.
    In relation to robbery, the court in <i>Krug</i> stated at p. 202 that by
    enacting s. 83, Parliament had “in substance…create[d] an aggravated form
    of robbery, to punish more severely an accused who uses a firearm in perpetrating
    that offence by imposing an additional penalty including a mandatory period
    of imprisonment.” </p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText>Parliament subsequently removed robbery and certain
    other indictable offences (e.g. manslaughter, aggravated sexual assault)
    from s. 85 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> (the successor to s. 83 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>), and enacted s. 344(a) and other similar provisions providing for
    minimum sentences where the aggravating factor of using a firearm while committing
    those offences is present: the<i> Firearms Act</i>, S.C. 1995, c. 39. </p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText>In<i> R. v. Lapierre</i> (1998), 123 C.C.C. (3d) 332
    (Q.C.A.), the court commented that documents filed by the Attorney General
    of Canada in that case showed that, in relation to robbery, s. 85 did not
    meet its goal of constituting a separate deterrent measure to strongly discourage
    the use of firearms in the commission of crimes. This was because some judges
    applied the totality principle and reduced the sentence imposed for the main
    offence by the sentence required under s. 85.</p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText>While an accused is liable to an enhanced penalty
    under s. 344(a) for using a firearm while committing a robbery, the accused
    is no longer subject to conviction for an additional offence. In my view,
    the evolution of these provisions supports the view that in enacting s. 344(a)
    Parliament did not intend to create a separate offence. </p>
