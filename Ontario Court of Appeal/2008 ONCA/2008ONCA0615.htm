    appellant appeals his conviction by a court composed of Dunn J. and a jury
    on three counts of robbery and one count of using a firearm while committing
    an indictable offence.  At the conclusion of the oral argument, we allowed
    the appeal and ordered a new trial, with reasons to follow.  These are those
    reasons.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Introduction</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown alleged that the appellant was one of five persons involved in the
    planning and execution of a home invasion of a drug dealer.  Two of these
    people were in the home of the victim at the time that the three other masked
    intruders executed the robbery.  The Crown alleged that the appellant was
    one of the three masked intruders who robbed the drug dealer and two of his
    friends.  The main Crown witness was an accomplice, Gharbi-Hamel, who was
    in the victim’s home at the time of the robbery.  The trial judge gave the
    jury a <i>Vetrovec</i> [<i>R. v. Vetrovec</i> (1982), 67 C.C.C. (2d) 1 (S.C.C.)]
    warning regarding Gharbi-Hamel’s evidence and told the jury that they should
    look for confirmation of his evidence before relying on it.  By the time
    of the trial Gharbi-Hamel and three other men had pleaded guilty to various
    offences for their roles in the robbery.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant raises three grounds of appeal.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The
      Use of Fernandes’ Identification Evidence</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge erred in his instructions to the jury
    respecting the evidence of a witness, Fernandes, who was in the apartment
    at the time of the robbery.  Mr. Fernandes had a confrontation with the robbers
    after they left the apartment.  He described that confrontation to the police
    following the robbery and testified at the preliminary hearing.  At the trial
    he testified that during this confrontation the mask slipped off one of the
    robbers and this man was the appellant, who he pointed out in the prisoner’s
    box.  He testified that he recognized the appellant as that robber when he
    saw him entering the courthouse the day before he testified.  Fernandes did
    not know the appellant before the robbery but had seen him at the preliminary
    hearing. The trial was the first occasion that Fernandes testified that the
    perpetrator’s mask had slipped and that he had seen his face.  He had made
    no mention of this in his statement to the police.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge gave a standard caution regard the frailty of eye-witness identification
    evidence focusing on the evidence of Gharbi-Hamel, but also pointing out
    that Gharbi-Hamel recognized the appellant since he worked with the appellant
    and had been involved in planning the robbery. The trial judge did not mention
    Fernandes in this context, nor did he identify the circumstances surrounding
    his late identification of the appellant and relate them to the cautions
    regarding eye-witness identification evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge later reviewed Fernandes’ evidence but did not characterize the
    circumstances of his late recognition of the appellant as frailties in his
    evidence, and left it to the jury to “conclude what weight to give to Mr.
    Fernandes’ evidence”. He gave them no caution regarding the value of in-dock
    identification.  The trial judge had earlier told the jury that they could
    use Fernandes’ identification of the appellant as confirmation of the evidence
    of Gharbi-Hamel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree with the appellant that the trial judge erred in law in his charge
    to the jury regarding their treatment of the evidence of Fernandes. The trial
    judge should have given them an instruction that Fernandes’
    in-dock identification, standing alone, has virtually no value. The trial
    judge should have identified the specific frailties of Fernandes’ identification
    of the appellant in the context of the charge on eye-witness identification.  Finally,
    Fernandes’ evidence should not have been left to the jury as capable of confirming
    the evidence of Gharbi-Hamel.  As was said in <i>Vetrovec</i> at p. 13, the
    trier of fact wants “some other piece of evidence which tends to convince
    us that [the accomplice] is telling the truth”.  Given the substantial frailties
    of Fernandes’ eye-witness identification, that part of his testimony was
    not capable of confirming Gharbi-Hamel’s testimony implicating the appellant.  We
    note that in a somewhat similar case, <i>R. v. Wang</i> (2001), 153 C.C.C.
    (3d) 321 at para. 36, this court held that such evidence is capable of constituting
    confirmation.  <i>Wang</i>, however, was decided before <i>R. v. Hibbert</i> (2002),
    163 C.C.C. (3d) 129 (S.C.C.) where the court explained the limited value
    of in-dock identification and the limited purpose for which that evidence
    can be adduced.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
    this evidence was the only piece of confirmatory evidence that spoke to the
    guilt of the appellant, we cannot say that the verdict would necessarily
    have been the same had these errors not been made.  On this ground alone,
    the judgment must be set aside and a new trial ordered.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Admissibility
      of the Guilty Pleas of the Accomplices</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second ground of appeal relates to the admission into evidence of the fact
    that three other men implicated by Gharbi-Hamel pled guilty to the robbery.  The
    trial judge left the guilty pleas as evidence capable of confirming his testimony.  This
    evidence was inadmissible hearsay, which the trial judge allowed the jury
    to use for the truth of its contents, i.e. that the other men implicated
    by Gharbi-Hamel were in fact perpetrators. See <i>R. v.
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Berry</i> (1957), 118 C.C.C. 55 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  However, since other admissible evidence was led regarding the guilt
    of two of the three, the prejudice from this error was minimal and if this
    were the only error we would have applied the proviso in s. 686(1)(b)(<i>iii</i>)
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Answer
      to the Jury’s Question</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    third ground of appeal is that the trial judge failed to adequately answer
    one of the jury’s questions regarding whether the appellant could be guilty
    of robbery if he was only involved in planning the crime.  The trial judge
    told the jury that planning could be sufficient for guilt in certain circumstances,
    but that the Crown’s case was that the appellant was a full participant in
    the robbery.  Given our disposition of the appeal on the first ground of
    appeal it is not strictly necessary to deal with this ground of appeal.  However,
    since the issue could arise on the new trial we would make this observation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    only evidence of the appellant’s participation in the planning of the robbery
    came from Gharbi-Hamel.  His testimony as to what the appellant did or said
    during this planning was so vague that it would not have been possible for
    a trier of fact to find that he aided or abetted the robbery on this basis.  On
    this record, the trial judge should have told the jury that they could not
    convict the appellant solely on the basis of planning and that they had to
    find that he actually participated in the execution of the robbery.</p>
