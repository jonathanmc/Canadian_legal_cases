  <h2>I.          INTRODUCTION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants, Matthew Sparrow and Michael Yankowski, were jointly convicted
    of multiple offences relating to the physical, emotional and sexual abuse
    of a nineteen-year old woman, S.K., over a period of approximately six months.  Sparrow
    was convicted of assault, unlawful confinement, threatening to cause serious
    bodily harm and death, and four counts of sexual assault.  He was sentenced
    to a total of eight years imprisonment.  Yankowski was convicted of assault,
    unlawful confinement and three counts of sexual assault.  He received a global
    sentence of five years imprisonment after credit of twelve months for pre-sentence
    custody.  Both appellants appeal their convictions and sentences.  For the
    reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeals.  </p>
  <h2><span

    FACTS</h2>
  <h2>(1)       Positions of the Parties</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>S.K.
    first met Sparrow in August of 1995 when she was an eighteen-year old high
    school student.  Shortly thereafter, she became pregnant with his child.  After
    their son was born, S.K. initially attempted to raise the baby alone.  However,
    in the fall of 1997, she began living with Sparrow in the house where he
    resided with his mother, Susan Sparrow, and Yankowski, Sparrows long-time
    friend and roommate.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    was the Crowns theory that almost immediately after S.K. took up residence
    with him, Sparrow became verbally and emotionally abusive towards her and
    that this abuse soon escalated to include physical and sexual abuse.  The
    Crown alleged that Yankowski came to despise S.K. and that he was a willing
    and active participant in almost all aspects of the abuse of S.K.  As the
    trial judge described it, the Crown asserted that the appellants deliberately
    created an exceedingly dark and oppressive atmosphere in which they consistently
    denigrated, demeaned and mistreated S.K.  Eventually, after about six months,
    S.K. managed to extricate herself from the Sparrow household.  Approximately
    four years later, she disclosed the appellants abuse to the authorities.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    defence theory at trial was that S.K. fabricated her allegations of abuse
    and her version of virtually every significant event involving the appellants,
    in an effort to punish Sparrow when she learned that he was cohabiting
    with another woman and her child.  The appellants portrayed S.K. as a skilled
    liar and a promiscuous woman who had insinuated herself into the Sparrow
    household by falsely claiming that she was about to be evicted from her residence
    and thereafter manipulated Sparrow in the ill-founded hope of achieving a
    long-term relationship with him.</p>
  <h2>(2)       Evidence at Trial</h2>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>S.K.
    was the main Crown witness at trial.  She testified that when she became
    pregnant by Sparrow in 1995, he wanted her to have an abortion but she refused.  After
    their son was born in June of 1996, S.K. lived alone with the baby in a subsidized
    housing co-op while Sparrow continued to reside with his mother and Yankowski.  S.K.
    said that, initially, Sparrow had only limited involvement with her and their
    son.  However, around Valentines Day in February of 1997, they resumed their
    relationship.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>S.K.
    testified that once she and Sparrow were back together, he would often visit
    her and their son and frequently spent the night at her co-op.  S.K. stated
    that she loved Sparrow and hoped that they would eventually marry.  She said
    that she and Sparrow had discussed marriage, that Sparrow knew that she loved
    him, that she thought he also loved her, and that he had asked her to live
    with him.  In September or October of 1997, S.K. moved with her son into
    Sparrows house.  At that time, unbeknownst to Sparrow, S.K. was pregnant
    with their second child.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>According
    to S.K., soon after she began living with Sparrow, both of the appellants
    began to subject her to what became a pattern of relentless verbal, physical,
    emotional and sexual abuse.  S.K. portrayed Sparrow as controlling and domineering.  She
    said that both appellants demanded that she do exactly what they told her
    to do.  She described a horrific pattern of violence and degradation in Sparrows
    home, of which she was the constant victim.  She said that, almost daily,
    one or both of the appellants beat and punched her on her legs with their
    fists, causing significant bruising to her legs.  S.K. testified that they
    also abused her verbally, calling her stupid and a hanky, like a handkerchief,
    something that was meant to be used and then thrown away.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>By
    November or December 1997, the appellants
    abusive acts had escalated.  S.K. said that they began to hogtie her by
    tying her hands and ankles together behind her back and fastening the bindings
    together, so that her legs were bent backwards and her ankles almost touched
    her mid-back.  This was done to punish S.K. when she refused to obey the
    appellants or in response to other perceived transgressions by S.K.   Ultimately,
    S.K. endured this treatment on almost a weekly basis.  S.K. stated that the
    appellants also locked her in a small closet for short periods of time and,
    on at least one occasion, one of them confined her in the attic of the house.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>S.K.
    further claimed that Sparrow required her to have sexual relations with his
    friends, including Yankowski, ostensibly in order for Sparrow to trust S.K.
    enough to marry her and to be confident that, after their marriage, she would
    not cheat on him.  S.K. acceded to this demand in part because Sparrow
    had told her that it was important, and something he needed her to do to
    build his trust in her.  The ensuing sexual encounters between S.K. and some
    of Sparrows friends often took place in Sparrows presence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>S.K.
    also described an especially harrowing and cruel event with Sparrow in her
    evidence.  She said that late one evening in October of 1997, she accepted
    Sparrows invitation to accompany him on a walk in the woods with their son.  Once
    they were deep in the woods, at a location unfamiliar to S.K., Sparrow declared
    that S.K. had not been listening to him or doing what he told her to do.  He
    told her to kiss [her] son good-bye because he had people waiting in there
    to take care of [her] and that she was not going to come out of the woods.  Sparrow
    then ran away, abandoning S.K. and their son as two men unknown to S.K. approached
    her from different directions.  S.K. screamed, grabbed her son from his stroller
    and ran, attempting to find her way out of the woods.  When she looked back,
    she saw Sparrow talking and laughing with the two men.  When Sparrow later
    caught up with S.K., he claimed that it was just a joke and that the two
    men were looking for their dog, rather than S.K.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Shortly
    after this incident, S.K. informed Sparrow of her second pregnancy.  The
    events surrounding this pregnancy and its termination were the subject of
    considerable controversy at trial.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>S.K.
    claimed that Sparrow again insisted that she have an abortion.  She said
    that he also offered to punch her in the stomach hard enough to cause a
    miscarriage.  When S.K. refused this offer, Sparrow became angry and upset,
    accused S.K. of ruining his life, and threatened that he could easily hire
    a crackhead to kill both her and their young son.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ultimately,
    S.K. arranged to have an abortion at a private clinic.  Both Sparrow and
    Yankowski accompanied her to the initial consultation at the clinic.  Sparrow
    went with her on the day of the procedure.  S.K. testified that one or more
    of the clinic nurses likely observed the bruises on her body that had been
    caused by the beatings inflicted by the appellants.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>S.K.
    stated that she was very upset at the prospect of the abortion because she
    wanted to have the baby.  She said that she asked the clinic nurses to tell
    Sparrow that the abortion could not be performed on medical grounds.  When
    the nurses declined this request, S.K. reluctantly underwent the abortion,
    contrary to her own wishes, because she feared Sparrows reaction if she
    failed to do so.  S.K. also claimed that, after the operation, she requested
    and received the after-birth or post-conception materials, which she then
    took home and hid in Mrs. Sparrows freezer at the Sparrow household.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>According
    to S.K., soon after her abortion, both Sparrow and Yankowski began to repeatedly
    sexually assault her.  She described a series of brutal and degrading sexual
    acts involving one or both men, including the forcible insertion of inanimate
    objects into her vagina and one instance of bestiality involving Sparrows
    dog.  On one occasion, Sparrow also inflicted involuntary anal intercourse
    on S.K., apparently to
    punish her for her alleged misbehaviour.  S.K. said that Sparrow expressed
    pleasure when she told him that this had been painful and made her bleed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>S.K.
    testified that she remained in Sparrows home for about six months, notwithstanding
    the appellants abuse, because she was depressed, had no self-esteem and
    felt worthless.  She said that she believed Sparrows claim that she was damaged
    goods and stupid, that she could not do anything useful, and that nobody
    else would ever love her.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Eventually,
    sometime in February of 1998, S.K. and her son moved out of Sparrows home
    at his request.  However, she continued to have sexual relations with Sparrow
    on occasion and again became pregnant by him, eventually giving birth to
    his second child.  S.K.s relationship with Sparrow ended after he began
    living with another woman 
    Corey Phoenix and
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Phoenixs child.  In her evidence, S.K. related that many months later, in
    about July of 2002 when she felt emotionally strong enough to do so, she
    disclosed the appellants abuse to the authorities.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown called three of S.K.s friends  Heidi Lambert, Shonda Colley and Willow
    Keefe  as witnesses at trial.  Lambert became acquainted with S.K. at the
    co-op where they both resided before S.K. moved in with Sparrow.  She testified
    that S.K. told her that she had informed Sparrow that she was being evicted
    from her co-op in order to be allowed to move into Sparrows residence.  However,
    Lambert said that, in fact, S.K. gave normal notice of her intention to leave
    the co-op and she was not evicted from the complex.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Lambert,
    Colley and Keefe all testified that they had observed severe or extensive
    bruising on one of S.K.s legs on separate occasions when, on the findings
    of the trial judge, S.K. was living in the Sparrow household.  Lambert and
    Keefe also indicated that when they spoke with S.K. on the telephone while
    she lived with Sparrow, they overheard one or more males in the background
    making insulting or demeaning comments to S.K.  Keefe identified the voices
    in question as those of the appellants.  She also testified that she overheard
    Sparrow
    speaking down to S.K., criticising her domestic skills and ordering her
    to do things.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>S.K.s
    family physician, Dr. Lawrence Barcza, testified concerning his observations
    and treatment of S.K. throughout 1997 and 1998.  He stated that although
    he did not observe bruising on S.K. during several of her visits to his office,
    he did see bruising all over S.K.s body, including on her arms and legs,
    during an examination of her in mid-November 1997.  He indicated that after
    S.K. denied any trauma that could account for the bruising, he concluded
    that her injuries were likely due to a spontaneous
    medical condition and ordered a series of tests to determine the cause of
    the bruising.  S.K. did not follow through with the tests.  Barcza also confirmed
    in his testimony that he could not rule out the possibility that S.K.s injuries
    had a traumatic origin.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Barcza
    saw S.K. within one week of her abortion.  He testified that as a result
    of post-surgical bleeding after her abortion, S.K. attended at a local hospital
    where she passed tissue that constituted products of conception.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Susan
    Sparrow, Sparrows mother, testified for the defence.  Although she denied
    seeing or hearing any abusive behaviour towards S.K. by the appellants, she
    did confirm three significant aspects of S.K.s testimony.  First, she said
    that she knew that S.K. was interested in pursuing a permanent relationship
    with Sparrow and that her son, in effect, had not been candid with her concerning
    the nature of his relationship with S.K.  Second, Mrs. Sparrow indicated
    that while she never saw extensive bruising on S.K., she observed some bruises
    on her legs from time to time when she and S.K. went swimming with S.K.s
    son, Mrs. Sparrows grandson.  Finally, Mrs. Sparrow said that S.K. had mentioned
    to her that, after her abortion, she had placed products of conception in
    the freezer at Sparrows house.  This disclosure to Mrs. Sparrow occurred
    before S.K. reported the appellants abuse to the police.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants testified in their own defence.  Sparrow claimed that his relation-ship
    with S.K. was casual, that he made no promises to her regarding a long-term
    relationship, and that she guilt-tripped him into agreeing that she could
    move in with him because she said that she was being evicted from her co-op
    and had nowhere else to go.  He denied abusing or assaulting S.K. in any
    way.  He also denied that he had told S.K. to sleep with his friends in order
    to gain his trust, that he had insisted that S.K. obtain an abortion or that
    he had threatened her in any way should she refuse.  Indeed, he denied threatening
    S.K. or their son at any time.  Although he acknowledged that, on the prompting
    of his mother, he had asked S.K. to leave his house, he claimed that S.K.
    actually moved out because she suspected his involvement with another woman.  He
    admitted that he had sexual relations with S.K. thereafter, albeit infrequently.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Yankowski
    also denied abusing or assaulting S.K. at any time.  He testified that while
    he and S.K. did not get along, he bore no animus towards her and claimed
    that things were peaceful and relatively amicable in the Sparrow household
    while S.K. was residing there.  Yankowski maintained that S.K. manipulated
    Sparrow into allowing her to move in with him, she was very promiscuous,
    she routinely left responsibility for her child with Sparrows mother so
    that she would be free to socialize, and Sparrow at no time threatened S.K.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    was also evidence at trial from three nurses who worked at the clinic where
    S.K. had her abortion.  As described by the trial judge, their testimony
    formed part of a multi-faceted defence attack on S.K.s credibility and
    reliability on all the circumstances surrounding [her] abortion.  The defence
    maintained that, in several respects, the evidence of these witnesses contradicted
    S.K.s version of the events surrounding her abortion, including: her testimony
    about the conduct of the clinic staff in response to her alleged reluctance
    to have the abortion; her claim that the nurses likely observed her bruises;
    and her assertion that, after her abortion, she received products of conception
    from clinic staff.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    defence also called Sparrows fianc<span
style='"Times New Roman"'>é</span>e  Corey Phoenix  and the appellants long-time
    friend and Yankowskis cousin  Jason Flear  as witnesses.  Flear testified
    about his observations of S.K. while she lived with Sparrow.  He said that
    during his frequent visits to Sparrows home, he never saw anyone abuse or
    mistreat S.K. 
    <st1:City w:st="on">

  <h2>(3)       Trial Judges Findings</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge viewed S.K. as a credible and reliable witness and accepted her
    evidence.  He concluded that the evidence of Lambert, Colley, Keefe and,
    to some extent, that of Barcza and Mrs. Sparrow  described above  tended
    to confirm important elements of S.K.s testimony about her life in the Sparrow
    household, her hopes for a permanent relationship with Sparrow, her allegations
    of abusive conduct by the appellants, and her description of the injuries
    she sustained as a result of the abuse.  In the trial judges opinion, Lambert,
    Colley and Keefe were credible and reliable witnesses.
     He viewed their evidence as independent, clear and convincing.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    contrast, the trial judge described Sparrows evidence as illogical if not
    nonsensical in many respects, at times self-serving in the extreme, and hollow
    and glib.  Similarly, the trial judge regarded Yankowski as a very unimpressive and incredible
    and unreliable witness.  In several instances, the trial judge noted that
    Sparrows and Yankowskis testimony was
    totally unsupported by any reliable evidence and was contrary to the weight
    of the evidence.  He rejected the appellants evidence, together with that
    of
    <st1:City w:st="on">

    Phoenix and Flear, and convicted the appellants of the offences charged.  </p>
  <h2>III.       ISSUES</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    are three issues on the conviction appeals.  First, Sparrow argues that the
    trial judge erred in his assessment of S.K.s evidence by failing to distinguish
    between her credibility and the reliability of her testimony and by misapprehending
    or ignoring evidence bearing on her credibility.  In particular, Sparrow
    maintains that the trial judge failed to appreciate or ignored Barczas and
    the nursing witnesses
    evidence about S.K.s injuries and the events surrounding her abortion.  Second,
    Sparrow submits that the verdicts against him are unreasonable.  Finally,
    Yankowski contends that the trial judge erred by shifting the burden of proof
    to the appellants, thereby failing to properly apply <i>R. v. W.(D.)</i> (1991),
    63 C.C.C. (3d) 397 (S.C.C.).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    are two issues on the sentence appeals.  Both appellants argue that the trial
    judge erred by imposing sentences that, in all the circumstances, are excessive.  Sparrow
    further asserts that the trial judge erred by failing to impose concurrent,
    rather than consecutive, sentences.</p>
  <h2>IV.       ANALYSIS</h2>
  <h2>A.        Conviction Appeals</h2>
  <h2>(1)       Trial Judges Assessment of S.K.s Evidence</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    did not call on the Crown to respond to the two grounds of appeal raised
    by Sparrow on his conviction appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judges 90-page reasons clearly indicate that he was alive to the distinction
    between credibility and reliability and that he took account of the evidence
    relied on by Sparrow to support the defence contention that S.K. fabricated
    her allegations of abuse and her description of the key events involving
    the appellants.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judges reasons contain a detailed analysis of the evidence at trial  extending
    to almost 80 pages  including the evidence said by Sparrow to contradict
    or belie S.K.s version of events.  In particular, the reasons reveal that
    the trial judge recognized the importance attached by the defence to the
    evidence of S.K.s therapeutic abortion and of her claim, disputed by the
    nursing witnesses, that she had received products of conception at the abortion
    clinic.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the trial judges opinion, Barczas evidence of S.K.s attendance at a hospital
    to stem her post-abortion hemorraging and his testimony that she passed tissue
    while at the hospital, afforded a potential explanation for the discrepancy
    in the evidence regarding whether, and where, S.K. obtained products of conception.  The
    trial judge concluded that, while this area of evidence was left largely
    undeveloped, Barczas testimony supported the possibility that these products
    were obtained by S.K. at the hospital, rather than at the abortion clinic.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, contrary to Sparrows submission, this inference was reasonably
    available to the trial judge on the evidence.  As the trial judge noted,
    S.K. was not cross-examined on her visit to the hospital following her abortion.  Thus,
    she was not afforded an opportunity to address the possibility that she was
    mistaken as to how she obtained products of conception.  Moreover, Barczas
    evidence on this issue was supported by hospital emergency department records
    and Susan Sparrows testimony provided some support for S.K.s claim that
    she obtained products of conception after her abortion.  In these circumstances,
    the trial judge did not err by declining to accept the defence assertion
    that S.K. had lied regarding the fact and manner of her receipt of these
    products.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Overall,
    the trial judge devoted nine pages of his reasons to a review and analysis
    of the evidence of the circumstances surrounding S.K.s abortion and of the
    defence claim that this evidence afforded significant proof of S.K.s alleged
    tendency to fabricate.  In rejecting the defence fabrication theory, the
    trial judge indicated that he had carefully considered this entire body
    of evidence  including the evidence from the abortion clinic nurses that
    they had not observed bruising on S.K.s body or provided her with products
    of conception  notwithstanding that he found it of minimal assistance in
    resolving the central issues at trial.  In the end, the trial judge simply
    disagreed with the defence view of the import of this evidence, saying:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I took a very different view of the Morgentaler
    evidence from that urged by the defence.  I was simply unable to conclude
    that it provided significant evidence of S.K.s tendency to lie and exaggerate
    or that it demonstrated her lack of credibility and reliability with respect
    to significant issues.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>This body of evidence, in my judgment, demonstrated
    consistency in [S.K.s] conduct relative to all of the circumstances surrounding
    the abortion as well as her feelings and motivations concerning this event.  It
    is also consistent with what she told Dr. Barcza about it.  In this sense,
    it actually buttressed her credibility and reliability relative to the nature
    of her relationship with Mr. Sparrow.</p>

    my opinion, there is no basis on this record for concluding that the trial
    judges appreciation of the medical or other evidence at trial was flawed.  To

    agree with the Crowns submission that the verdicts against Sparrow were
    entirely reasonable.  S.K.s evidence, confirmed in several important respects
    by the testimony of her three friends and, in part, by that of Barcza and
    Mrs. Sparrow, provided ample support for the trial judges conclusion that
    the Crown had proven Sparrows guilt to the requisite criminal standard on

    makes two main submissions in support of his argument that the trial judge
    erred by failing to apply <i>W.(D.), supra</i>.  He asserts that the trial
    judge prematurely concluded that he believed S.K., before considering the
    evidence relied on by the defence, thereby improperly shifting a burden to
    the appellants to demonstrate their innocence.  Yankowski also contends,
    in effect, that the trial judge treated this case as a credibility contest
    where the appellants evidence was necessarily rejected because, by the time
    of his consideration of it, the trial judge had already concluded that S.K.
    was credible and that he believed her.  I do not accept these submissions.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Yankowski
    relies heavily on the recent decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R.
    v. Y.(C.L.)</i> (2008), 227 C.C.C. (3d) 129 (<i>C.Y.L.</i>).  In that case,
    a majority of the Supreme Court allowed an appeal from the accuseds conviction
    on two counts of sexual assault on the ground that the trial judges bases
    for disbelieving the testimony of the accused rested on material misapprehensions
    of the evidence.  Justice Fish, dissenting in part (Binnie and Deschamps
    JJ. concurring in the dissent), would have allowed the appeal on both this
    ground and the additional ground that the trial judge misapplied the burden
    of proof, contrary to <i>W.(D.)</i>.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    principles established in <i>W.(D.)</i> have an entrenched place in our criminal
    law.  In <i>W.(D.)</i>, the Supreme Court of Canada considered the manner
    in which a jury should be charged on the principle of reasonable doubt.  Justice
    Cory, writing for the court, suggested that in a criminal case where credibility
    is the central issue and the accused testifies, the jury charge should include
    the following instruction in order to ensure that, as the trier of fact,
    the jury remains focused on reasonable doubt:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>First, if you believe the evidence of the accused,
    obviously you must acquit.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Second, if you do not believe the testimony of the
    accused but you are left in reasonable doubt by it, you must acquit.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Third, even if you are not left in doubt by the
    evidence of the accused, you must ask yourself whether, on the basis of the
    evidence which you do accept, you are convinced beyond a reasonable doubt
    by that evidence of the guilt of the accused.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>C.Y.L.</i>,
    Fish J. held that because the trial judge failed to adhere to the procedure
    outlined in <i>W.(D.)</i>, an inadvertent and impermissible shifting of the
    burden of proof to the accused had occurred.  In Fish J.s opinion, this
    error arose because the trial judge in <i>C.Y.L.</i> concluded that she believed
    the evidence of the complainant without taking into account at all the
    contrary evidence of the accused.  Justice Fish put it this way at paras.
    26-27:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Before even considering the appellants evidence,
    the trial judge had concluded not only that the complainants evidence was
    credible, but that it was in fact true: I believe the complainant, she
    stated (at para. 6).</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>   This conclusion, premature at best, amounted
    to a finding that the appellant was guilty as charged.  As a matter of law,
    the appellant was presumed innocent; as a matter of fact his fate had been
    sealed <i>without any consideration at all</i> of his evidence under oath
    at trial.  [Emphasis in original.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Yankowski
    argues that the same error occurred in this case.  He points out that before
    referring in his reasons to the evidence that favoured the defence  including
    the appellants testimony  the trial judge summarized S.K.s evidence and
    his views concerning it, and stated that her evidence had the ring of truth,
    that S.K. was a credible and reliable witness, and that he believed her.    </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    do not accept this argument.  This is not a case where the trial judge failed
    to recognize that <i>W.(D.)</i> was engaged.  This case turned on credibility
    and both appellants testified.  As a result, not surprisingly, <i>W.(D.)</i> figured
    prominently in the closing submissions of trial counsel and in the reasons
    of the trial judge.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Virtually
    at the outset of his reasons, the trial judge identified the importance of <i>W.(D.)</i>,
    stating: I have applied the principles emanating from the Supreme Court
    of Canadas decision in <i>R. v. W.(D.)</i> to my analysis of each count.  Immediately
    prior to this statement, he noted the Crowns burden of proof and the requisite
    criminal standard of proof and commented, [I]t is not a question of comparing
    or choosing between the Crown evidence and the defence evidence to see which
    version ought to be preferred.  Throughout, the Crown has the burden of proof.  Then,
    at the end of his reasons, the trial judge returned to <i>W.(D.)</i> and
    described his application of it in this case.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    do not read the trial judges references to <i>W.(D.)</i> as a hollow or
    rote nod to the approach dictated by <i>W.(D.)</i>  To the contrary, I agree
    with the Crown that the reasons show that the <i>W.(D.)</i> principles guided
    the trial judges reasoning.  Like <i>C.Y.L.</i>, this was a judge-alone
    trial.  A trial judge is presumed to know a principle as elementary as the
    presumption of innocence: <i>C.Y.L.</i> at para. 10.  This trial judge was
    very experienced.  His own words confirm that he was alert to the principles
    established in <i>W.(D.)</i>, the relevance of those principles to his assessment
    of credibility in this case, and the fact that the case was not a credibility
    contest between S.K. and the appellants.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge began his reasons by outlining the legal principles that informed
    his assessment of the evidence.  This review included an explicit reference
    to <i>W.(D.)</i>, described above, and to the burden of proof that attached
    to the Crown.  In addition, the trial judge noted that the historical nature
    of S.K.s allegations of abuse and the fact that they rested, to a significant
    extent, on the unconfirmed evidence of a single complainant, required that
    S.K.s evidence be scrutinized with special care.  The trial judge then undertook
    a detailed review and analysis of S.K.s testimony.  He next conducted a
    similar review and evaluation of the evidence that supported or tended to
    support her testimony, followed by a review and analysis of the appellants testimony
    and the other evidence that conflicted with or tended to undercut S.K.s
    version of events.  </p>

    his discussion of S.K.s testimony, before referring to the evidence led
    by the defence, the trial judge indicated that he viewed S.K. as credible
    and reliable, that he did not accept the defence contention that she was cunning
    and manipulative, and that he believed her.  In addition, when subsequently
    reviewing the evidence that the appellants claimed supported their position
    that S.K. was a manipulative liar, the trial judge stated, using the past
    tense, that he had rejected the defence theory of fabrication by S.K.,
    and that he had accepted S.K.s own evidence or that of other witnesses
    whose testimony he viewed as supportive of S.K.s evidence.</p>

    maintains that the organization of the reasons and the trial judges above-mentioned
    comments demonstrate that the controlling point for the trial judges assessment
    of the evidence was his premature finding that he believed S.K.  This led,
    Yankowski says, to the inevitable discounting by the trial judge of the evidence
    favourable to the defence, contrary to <i>W.(D.)</i>.</p>

    disagree.  In my view, neither the trial judges approach to the articulation
    of his reasoning process nor his challenged comments establish that he failed
    to properly assess the evidence favourable to the defence or that he neglected  to
    consider whether, without believing the appellants, he was left with a reasonable
    doubt as to their guilt on the whole of the evidence.</p>

    trial judge was not obliged to adopt any particular structure in fashioning
    his reasons or a specific order in reviewing the evidence adduced at trial.  Nor
    was he required to articulate the <i>W.(D.)</i> principles at each stage
    of his analysis of the evidence.  Moreover, the jurisprudence of the Supreme
    Court of Canada confirms that the steps identified in <i>W.(D.)</i> need
    not be religiously followed or articulated: see <i>C.Y.L.</i> at paras. 7-9.  What
    is required is that the trier of fact remain focused on the paramount question,
    namely, whether, on the whole of the evidence, the trier of fact is left
    with a reasonable doubt about the guilt of the accused: <i>C.Y.L.</i> at
    para. 6.  See also <i>R. v. Minuskin </i>(2003), 68 O.R. (3d) 577 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region

    his assessment of the evidence met this test.</p>

    trial judges challenged remarks, described above, cannot be viewed in isolation
    or in a piecemeal fashion.  Rather, the reasons must be read and interpreted
    as a whole.  To do otherwise would distort the substance of the trial judges
    reasoning.  This proposition was well-expressed by Doherty J.A. of this court

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Where a phrase in a trial judges reasons is open

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>   A trial judges reasons cannot be read or analyzed
    as if they were an instruction to a jury.  Instructions provide a road-map
    to direct lay jurors on their journey toward a verdict.  Reasons for judgment
    are given after a trial judge has reached the end of that journey and explain
    why he or she arrived at a particular conclusion.  They are not intended

    Dohertys comments were accepted by both the majority and the minority of
    the Supreme Court in <i>C.Y.L.</i> (Abella J. at para. 11 and Fish J. at
    para. 29).  The majority in <i>C.Y.L.</i> also accepted Doherty J.A.s caution
    in <i>Morrissey</i> at pp. 203-5 that appellate judges are not to dissect,
    parse, or microscopically examine the reasons of a trial judge (<i>C.Y.L.</i> at

    recognize that, considered in isolation, there are passages in the trial
    judges reasons that offer some support for Yankowskis claim that the trial
    judge concluded that he believed S.K. and, based on that belief, thereafter
    accepted the evidence of other witnesses that tended to support S.K.s testimony
    without factoring the evidence that favoured the defence into his analysis.  As
    the Crown acknowledged before this court, it would have been preferable if
    the trial judge had not used the past tense in expressing his views of the
    evidence favourable to the Crown prior to adverting to the evidence relied
    on by the defence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    viewed in their entirety, the trial judges reasons may fairly be interpreted
    as simply explaining, in considerable detail and in accordance with <i>W.
    (D.)</i>, why he concluded that the evidence he accepted was credible and
    reliable, why he rejected the evidence that favoured the defence (including
    the appellants
    testimony), and why, in the end, he concluded on the whole of the evidence
    that the Crown had met its burden to prove the appellants guilt beyond a
    reasonable doubt.  </p>

    the organization of the trial judges reasons and the language that he used
    to describe his credibility and reliability findings must be viewed in this
    context.  The trial judge, in my opinion, was simply attempting to explain
    what he decided and why he made that decision.  His reasons were responsive
    to the issues and the defence raised at trial, especially the vigorous defence
    attack on S.K.s credibility and reliability.  As Doherty J.A. noted in <i>Morrissey</i> at
    p. 204, in cases where, as here, the result turns on fact-finding and not
    on the application of contested legal principles, it is appropriate that
    the reasons should focus on telling the parties what evidence was believed
    and why it was believed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    interpretation of the trial judges reasons is reinforced by his concluding
    comments.  After reviewing all the evidence at trial and detailing his assessment
    of that evidence, the trial judge stated in respect of each appellant:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I applied the <i>R. v. W.(D.)</i> test to the evidence
    on each count.  I believed and accepted the Crowns evidence against him
    upon each count.  I accepted S.K.s evidence as credible and reliable.  In
    a number of significant respects, other credible and reliable evidence confirmed
    her version of events.  I rejected the evidence of [the appellant in question].  His
    evidence, together with the other defence evidence, did not lead to a reasonable
    doubt.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge then added, again in respect of each appellant:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><i>Considering all of the admissible evidence on
      each count</i>, I was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of [Sparrows
      or Yankowskis] guilt.  On each count  the Crown met its burden to prove
      his guilt, beyond a reasonable doubt.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus,
    both at the beginning and at the end of his reasons the trial judge explicitly
    confirmed his focus on the analytical framework established in <i>W.(D.)</i>.  By
    his above-quoted comments, he indicated that he had tested the whole of the
    evidence against the steps outlined in <i>W.(D.)</i>.  There is no reason
    to believe that this seasoned trial judge did not do precisely what he said
    he had done.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    is a further reason for rejecting Yankowskis claim that the trial judge
    failed to properly apply <i>W. (D.)</i>.  The primary evidence of fabrication
    by S.K. came from the appellants
    own testimony.  The trial judge reviewed the appellants evidence at length
    and provided detailed reasons for his rejection of it.  Indeed, he listed
    fifteen specific areas of Sparrows evidence that he felt demonstrated that
    his testimony was unworthy of belief, unreliable or both.  He also listed
    nine separate factors that led him to disbelieve Yankowski and to regard
    his testimony as dubious.  His reasons for rejecting the appellants
    testimony, which went well beyond the fact that he believed S.K.s evidence,
    were thoughtful and compelling and his findings concerning their evidence
    were open to him on the record.   There is nothing objectionable in the trial
    judges assessment of the appellants
    evidence in light of the whole of the evidence, including S.K.s testimony.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    the trial judge was equally thorough and careful in his approach to the other
    evidence bearing on the issue of possible fabrication by S.K.  Three examples
    will suffice to illustrate this point.  First, Yankowski argues that the
    trial judge failed to consider the significance of Heidi Lamberts evidence
    that S.K. was not evicted from her co-op but, rather, departed from the co-op
    under normal circumstances.  According to Yankowski, this evidence established
    both that S.K. had lied to and manipulated Sparrow by concocting a story
    of an eviction from her co-op in order to gain entry to the Sparrow household
    and, further, that she was prepared to deceive the court throughout her testimony.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>But
    the trial judge was alive to Lamberts evidence on this issue and mentioned
    it in his review of her testimony.  Subsequently in his reasons, he elaborated
    on why he regarded S.K.s alleged misrepresentation to Sparrow on this issue
    as not terribly significant and outlined the evidence that afforded an
    explanation as to why S.K. may have falsely claimed to Sparrow that she had
    been evicted.  The trial judge thus recognized the inconsistency in the evidence
    on this issue.  He addressed the significance of the inconsistency both from
    the perspective that S.K. may in fact have lied to Sparrow about an eviction
    from her residence  as the defence claimed  and, as well, from the perspective
    that the alleged lie had not occurred.  This approach expressly took account
    of the defence contention that S.K. had lied to Sparrow about the reason
    for her departure from her co-op in order to manipulate him.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    Yankowski submits that the trial judges assessment of the evidence of the
    abortion clinic nursing staff reveals that he undertook a slanted analysis
    of this evidence in order to reconcile it with S.K.s testimony.  I disagree.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    I stated earlier, the trial judges reasons indicate that he appreciated
    that there was a conflict in the evidence regarding whether, and where, S.K.
    obtained products of conception following her abortion and concerning S.K.s
    interactions with the clinic nursing staff and their observations of her.  He
    was clearly mindful of the defence claim that S.K.s evidence on these matters
    was fabricated.  As I have mentioned, the trial judge explicitly stated that
    he had reviewed this entire body of evidence and explained why he found
    it unhelpful.  He then addressed some of the alleged inconsistencies and
    contradictions in the evidence as stressed by the defence.  In so doing,
    the trial judge explained why he rejected the defence assertion that S.K.
    had fabricated and exaggerated the events surrounding her abortion and why
    he ultimately concluded that the evidence supported S.K.s version of what
    had occurred in relation to her abortion.  The trial judge was required to
    do no more.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    Yankowski argues that the trial judges treatment of the evidence of S.K.s
    motive to fabricate reveals that he wrongly proceeded from the premise that
    S.K. had been truthful in her evidence.  Once again, I disagree.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge was alert to the defence claim that S.K. fabricated her allegations
    of abuse to punish Sparrow for his involvement with
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Phoenix.  The trial judge identified and addressed this issue as an area
    of inconsistency or contradiction in the evidence.  He reviewed the defence
    position on this issue, reiterated the Crowns burden of proof, and pointed
    out that S.K. had learned of Sparrows involvement with other women, including
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Phoenix, many months before making her allegations of abuse known to the
    authorities.  I see no error in the trial judges approach to the evidence
    of S.K.s alleged motive to fabricate.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly,
    contrary to Yankowskis submissions, I conclude that the trial judge did
    come to grips with the defence theory of fabrication and with the evidence
    that tended to support or undermine that theory.  In my view, his evaluation
    of that evidence was even-handed and thorough.  His reasons directly responded
    to the defence attack on S.K.s credibility and reliability.  They reveal
    that the trial judge understood that the whole of the evidence had to be
    considered in determining the culpability of the appellants and his verdicts
    were based on his appreciation of all the evidence.  His reasons satisfy
    the requirements of <i>W.(D.)</i>.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[71]<span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    would also dismiss the appellants sentence appeals.  Given the circumstances
    of these offences and these offenders, the sentences imposed were entirely
    fit.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants horrendous abuse of S.K., a young and vulnerable woman, was appalling
    and sustained.  It occurred in the context of a domestic relationship in
    which Sparrow was a direct participant and of which Yankowski was completely
    aware.  On the findings of the trial judge, it included many particularly
    dehumanizing and degrading acts, in which both men participated, that were
    deliberately designed to control, terrorize and subjugate S.K. and to rob
    her of her dignity, autonomy and feelings of self-worth.  The trial judge
    held that the appellants joint sexual offences were extremely grave, involving brutality,
    depravity and dehumanization.  In the trial judges view, [t]he overall
    treatment by both offenders of the victim was despicable and deplorable.  I
    agree.  In addition, the appellants wrongful acts had a profoundly negative
    impact on S.K.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    imposing sentence on the appellants, the trial judge specifically took account
    of the totality principle and the range of sentences proposed by the defence
    and then stated: Manifestly, the level of moral culpability of each of the
    two offenders is extremely high and the egregious facts in support of these
    convictions require a very severe penalty.  Again, I agree.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judges discretionary decision to impose consecutive, rather than concurrent,
    sentences in respect of some of Sparrows convictions attracts considerable
    deference from this court.  I see no basis for appellate interference with
    that decision.  Given the circumstances that I have described above, Sparrows
    overall sentence is neither unduly long or harsh.  Nor is there a sufficiently
    close factual nexus between the offences in question as to render the consecutive
    sentences imposed inappropriate.</p>
  <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    the reasons given, I would dismiss the appellants conviction appeals.  I
    would grant leave to appeal sentence and dismiss the appellants sentence
    appeals.</p>
