    for obtaining a new liquor licence, the applicant asked the City of Toronto
    Building Department for a letter confirming his restaurant complied with
    municipal by-laws. The City refused to issue the compliance letter unless
    the applicant reduced the size of his restaurant to conform to the then applicable
    zoning by-law. </p>

    July 11, 1997, the City issued building permit #400567, which permitted the
    applicant to move the front doors of his restaurant inward, thereby reducing
    the size of the restaurant to less than 165 square metres of non-residential
    gross floor area as required under the zoning by-law. However, after the
    compliance letter was issued, the applicant moved the front doors back to
    their previous location without obtaining permission from the Building Department
    to do so. </p>

    a result of the applicant’s conduct, the City laid two charges against him: </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>i) carrying out construction that was not authorized under
    building permit #400567, contrary to s. 8(13) of the <i>Building Code Act</i>,
    S.O. 1992, c. 23; and </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>ii) exceeding the maximum permissible non-residential gross
    floor area for a restaurant as set out in a zoning by-law, contrary to s.
    67(1) of the <i>Planning Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.13.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    applicant was originally tried and convicted of both offences in July 1999.
    Following an appeal to the provincial offences appeal court, a new trial
    was ordered.  On the re-trial, Napier J.P. convicted the applicant of both
    offences. On the second appeal to the provincial offences appeal court, Paris
    J. upheld the convictions. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>Provincial
      Offences Act </i>sets a high threshold for obtaining leave to appeal to
      this court. Section 131 requires that an applicant establish: i) special
      grounds; ii) a question of law alone; and iii) that in the particular circumstances,
      it is essential in the public interest or for the due administration of
      justice that leave be granted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    applicant raises two main issues on his leave application. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    he submits that the provincial offences appeal court judge erred by refusing
    to admit as fresh evidence copies of a memo between City officials concerning
    building permit #400567. The memos were not disclosed to the applicant until
    after the re-trial. The applicant claims that the memos would have supported
    his position that the signature “William Gallos” on the building permit application
    was a forgery and that the permit was issued fraudulently. He says it is
    essential in the public interest and for the due administration of justice
    that a prosecution based on fraud not be permitted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the applicant submits that the provincial offences appeal court judge erred
    by failing to find that the applicant enjoys legal non-conforming use status
    in relation to the size of his restaurant. He claims he is entitled to this
    status because his restaurant is below grade and because a June 1989 zoning
    by-law that extended the 165 square metre size restriction on restaurants
    to below grade space is invalid. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    applicant submits that the provincial offences appeal court judge erred in
    upholding a finding that his restaurant is at grade, because in making that
    finding the justice of the peace improperly relied on evidence of a City
    policy concerning the meaning of grade. Further, the applicant contends that
    the provincial offences appeal court judge erred by failing to address the
    applicant’s submission that the June 1989 zoning by-law is invalid. Finally,
    the applicant submits that it is essential in the public interest that this
    court determine whether the meaning of “grade” should be interpreted based
    on a City policy and whether the June 1989 by-law is valid. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, the leave application is dismissed.</p>

'><b>II. Background</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    history of the applicant’s restaurant and of the enactment of the applicable
    by-laws is somewhat complicated.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    applicant purchased his property, which is located on the north side of
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Queen Street East, east of
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Woodbine Avenue, in 1976. According to the applicant, in 1976 the building
    on the property was set back about 35 feet from the property line and there
    was a hill in front of the building sloping upwards at an angle of about
    60 degrees. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    purchasing his property, the applicant continued to operate an existing laundromat
    in the basement for a year or two but then started work on developing the
    basement for use as a family restaurant. By the end of 1985, the applicant
    had exposed the basement by removing the earth in front of the building and
    had also excavated a portion of the basement to make it deeper. In addition,
    he had lengthened the building by constructing a new front wall about seven
    or eight feet out from the original building and had built a first-floor
    veranda and steps up to the first floor. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    applicant obtained a permit to build a restaurant on his property on May
    31, 1989.  At that time, By-law 438-86, as amended by By-law 69-87, established
    a size restriction for restaurants in the Beaches of 165 square metres of
    gross floor area. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    was no dispute on this application that the general definition of “gross
    floor area” in By-law 438-86, as it applied to the applicant’s restaurant
    on May 31, 1989, did not include below grade space: see Appendix “A” for
    the text of the relevant by-laws. However, on June 1, 1989, the day after
    the applicant obtained his original building permit, the City passed amending
    By-law 361-89. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Among
    other things, amending By-law 361-89 changed the applicable size restriction
    for the applicant’s restaurant from 165 square metres of “gross floor area” to
    165 square metres of “non-residential gross floor area”. Subject to certain
    exclusions, the general definition of “non-residential gross floor area” in
    By-law 438-86, as it applied to the applicant’s restaurant, included below
    grade space: see Appendix “A”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    1994, the applicant decided to renovate the first-floor veranda to make the
    front of his building more aesthetically pleasing. He demolished the front
    of the building, including the front stairway; moved the stairs to the other
    side of the building; extended the first-floor veranda; and extended the
    front wall of the bottom floor restaurant to match the first-floor extension,
    thereby increasing the size of the restaurant. According to the applicant,
    all of this work was completed under building permit #366550. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    May 28, 1996, the applicant obtained building permit #383446, allowing him
    to expand his restaurant upstairs. In order to grant this permit, Mr. Mathewson,
    a plans examiner for the City, had to determine that the additional space
    would not cause the applicant’s restaurant to exceed the 165 square metres
    size limit. Although building permit #383446 was later revoked, Mr. Mathewson
    testified that he was able to grant the extra space to the applicant by classifying
    the kitchen as a below grade accessory use to the restaurant. Prior to July
    2, 1996, below grade accessory uses were not included in the calculation
    of non-residential gross floor area. As accessory use was not defined in
    the by-law, plans examiners had discretion to determine whether a particular
    use was properly considered to be accessory.<span

line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Mathewson indicated that he excluded the kitchen from the 165 square metre
    size limit by classifying the kitchen as “basically mechanical space” and
    therefore as an accessory use. He confirmed that the plans filed for building
    permit #383446 showed a step down to the kitchen and therefore that the kitchen
    was below grade at the time. He also confirmed that the front doors of the
    restaurant were in their pre-building permit #400567 location, and that with
    the kitchen excluded, the restaurant area was less than 165 square metres. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Mathewson acknowledged that his interpretation was
    “stretching things” but explained that the applicant seemed “fairly desperate”,
    that he [Mr. Mathewson] “felt maybe [he] should help [the applicant]”, and
    that it was not a large space on the second floor. In re-examination, Mr.
    Mathewson confirmed that rather than being an accessory use, a kitchen is
    generally considered an essential part of a restaurant. He also confirmed
    that his interpretation was subsequently overruled.<span class=MsoFootnoteReference> </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    July 2, 1996, the City passed amending By-law 1996-0332. Among other things,
    this by-law added a new definition of “non-residential gross floor area” to
    the section of By-law 438-86 that creates the size restriction for restaurants
    in the Beaches. This definition omitted the exclusion for accessory uses,
    electing instead to specify the particular uses that were to be excluded
    from the calculation of non-residential gross floor area.<span
class=MsoFootnoteReference> </span>In addition, this definition deleted an exclusion
    for below grade space used for a permitted non-residential purpose as of
    January 31, 1976. This deletion closed a perceived loophole created by By-law
    361-89 that may have allowed building owners to create large restaurants
    by expanding into below grade space formerly used for commercial purposes:
    see Appendix “A”.</p>

    December 12, 1996, city officials convened a meeting with the applicant to
    discuss issues concerning the size of his restaurant. By letter dated January
    23, 1997, Ms.&nbsp;Coburn, the chief building official at the time, revoked
    building permit #383446 under s. 8(10)(d) of the <i>Building Code Act</i>, stating

    April 6, 1997, the Alcohol and Gaming Commission decided that the applicant
    could expand the licensed capacity of his restaurant provided that he satisfied
    certain conditions, one of which was to obtain a compliance letter from the
    City of Toronto Building Department. The Building Department declined to
    issue a compliance letter because they claimed that, under By-law 438-86,
    as amended, the applicant’s restaurant exceeded the permissible non-residential
    gross floor area. </p>

    July 11, 1997, the City issued building permit #400567 to permit the applicant
    to move the front doors of the restaurant and perform certain other work
    to achieve the necessary size reduction. The building permit application
    was dated July 7, 1997 and bore the signature
    “William Gallos”, as well as the signature of a Building Department witness.
    The application was accompanied by a plan prepared by Delta Engineering dated
    June 30, 1997 (the “Delta Engineering Plan”) containing some printed calculations
    concerning the dimensions of the restaurant. </p>

    gross floor area as 1737.91 square feet, just under the permitted maximum
    of 1776 square feet (165 square metres). Mr. Tipping described the applicant’s

    that the applicant “[was] in a way compelled to abide by the City request
    [to reduce the size of his restaurant] to obtain [his] liquor licence approval”,
    but rejected the applicant’s evidence that he did not apply for building

    give notice of its intention to amend the size restriction for restaurants

    provincial offences appeal court judge dismissed the applicant’s motion to
    introduce fresh evidence concerning the application for building permit #400567
    based on a finding lack of due diligence. He noted that the case had been
    before the courts since November 1997 and had been appealed previously. He
    said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Although Mr.

    first basis was the justice of the peace’s finding that the applicant’s restaurant
    was at grade. The provincial offences appeal court judge noted that the confusion
    in relation to this issue arises from the fact that the building is built
    into a hill and from the different definitions of grade under the <i>Planning
    Act</i> and the <i>Building Code Act</i>. The provincial offences appeal
    court judge concluded that the justice of the peace was entitled to find
    that the restaurant was at grade based on Mr. Mathewson’s evidence. Moreover,
    in the light of this finding, it was unnecessary that the provincial offences
    appeal court judge determine whether amending By-law 361-89 was invalid.</p>

    second basis was the applicant’s conduct in moving the front doors of his
    restaurant, thereby reducing the floor space of his restaurant below the
    1996 By-law maximum, and causing him to lose any legal non-conforming use
    to which he may otherwise have been entitled. In making this finding, the
    provincial offences appeal court judge said:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='

    As already noted, the justice of the peace rejected the applicant’s evidence
    in this respect. In doing so, she relied on the evidence of the City employee
    who witnessed the building permit application, the applicant’s failure to
    complain to the police or raise the issue in a timely way, and the applicant’s

    once the City led evidence that the applicant’s restaurant exceeded 165 square

    the applicant bore the onus of proving that he was entitled to a legal non-conforming

    unrevoked building permit for construction of a restaurant in excess of 165

    was required to demonstrate: </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='

'>i) By-law 361-89 is invalid and therefore the size restriction on restaurants

line-height:normal'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    applicant led no evidence on this issue. Rather, as the provincial offences
    appeal court judge observed, the evidence that the applicant relied on (the
    evidence of Mr. Tipping and Mr. Padanyi) was directed at the issue of grade
    under the <i>Building Code Act</i>. Even if the applicant is correct in submitting
    that the justice of the peace erred in relying on Mr. Mathewson’s evidence
    that the restaurant is at grade because Mr. Mathewson’s evidence was premised
    on a City policy, that would serve only to neutralize the impugned evidence;
    it would not prove that the applicant’s restaurant is below grade within
    the meaning of By-law 438-86. </p>

line-height:normal'>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    because the applicant failed to lead evidence proving that his restaurant

line-height:normal'>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    in his application for leave to appeal, the applicant has not challenged
    the provincial offences appeal court judge’s conclusion that the applicant
    lost any legal non-conforming use to which he may otherwise have been entitled
    when he moved the front doors of his restaurant inward in order to comply
    with By-law 438-86, as amended. Even if I am wrong in relation to the first
    point, this conclusion is a complete answer to the applicant’s arguments
    concerning the legal non-conforming use issue. </p>

      land, building or structure in question continues to be used for that purpose: <i>Planning
      Act</i>, s. 34(9)(a). Even assuming that the applicant was entitled to
      a legal non-conforming use entitling him to a restaurant larger than 165
      square metres of non-residential gross floor area at some point, he discontinued
      that use when he moved the doors of his restaurant inward so the City would
      issue a compliance letter. In these circumstances, I fail to see any available
      argument that the provincial offences appeal court judge erred in holding
      that the applicant lost any legal non-conforming use to which he may otherwise
      have been entitled when he moved the doors of his restaurant to bring it
      into compliance with the then current by-law.</p>

line-height:normal'>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    to the extent that Mr. Mathewson’s evidence may give rise to an argument
    that the applicant was entitled to legal non-conforming use status because,
    as of May 28, 1996, the kitchen was below grade and therefore properly excluded
    from the calculation of gross floor area if By-law 361-89 is invalid, I am
    sceptical that the applicant led evidence at trial capable of supporting
    a finding that he was authorized to have a restaurant of the size that it
    was on May 28, 1996.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

    any event, I am unable to see how this issue would give rise to a question
    of law alone that could meet the test that it is essential in the public
    interest or for the due administration of justice that leave be granted.
    Subject to what I will say about reasons, any issue concerning whether the
    applicant demonstrated at trial that he was authorized to have a restaurant
    of the size that it was on May 28, 1996 involves a factual determination
    specific to the applicant’s premises.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    acknowledge that the provincial offences appeal court judge did not address
    in his reasons the question of whether the applicant had demonstrated that
    he was authorized to have a restaurant of the size that it was on May 28,
    1996. However, because of his finding that the applicant lost any entitlement
    he may otherwise have had to a legal non-conforming use when he moved the
    front doors of his restaurant inward, the provincial offences appeal court
    judge was not required to address the authorized size issue. Absent an arguable
    basis for holding that the provincial offences appeal court judge’s finding
    concerning losing any entitlement to legal non-conforming use was wrong and
    that the provincial offences appeal court judge therefore erred in failing
    to address the authorized size issue, I see no basis for holding that the
    authorized size issue involves a question of law alone that could meet the
    balance of the test for granting leave to appeal.</p>

    given the foregoing conclusions, even if By-law 361-89 was invalid, the applicant
    failed to demonstrate that he was entitled to a legal non-conforming use.
    In these circumstances, it was unnecessary that the provincial offences appeal

    I wish to note that the applicant raised an issue in his factum about being
    treated unfairly by the City and claimed that Building Department officials
    failed to advise him about what he would have to prove to demonstrate a legal
    non-conforming use. I am not persuaded that the applicant’s submissions concerning
    this issue raise a question of law alone that meets the remaining elements

    evidence of some City witnesses appears to contradict the applicant’s assertions
    about lack of advice. Further, the applicant has not provided any authority
    to support the proposition that City officials have a duty to provide such
    advice. Finally, in the context of this case, it would hardly be surprising
    if City officials did not fully understand the basis upon which the applicant
    claimed to be entitled to a legal non-conforming use. The applicant’s position
    is premised on the invalidity of By-law 361-89, a position he did not raise
    until the provincial offences appeal. </p>

    Mathewson’s evidence concerning this issue, which was led by the applicant
    in cross-examination, is confusing. He referred to the definition of <i>gross
    floor area</i> and to an exception from gross floor area for below grade
    accessory uses applicable to residential space as the basis for granting
    building permit #383446. However, the applicant’s restaurant was commercial
    space and the definition of gross floor area as it applied to commercial
    space did not include below grade space in any event. Further, building permit
    #383446 was granted long after By-law 361-89 came into force, introducing
    the definition of non-residential gross floor area for commercial-residential
    space. </p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText>It appears more likely that Mr. Mathewson may have
    relied on an exception for below grade accessory uses that at one time formed
    part of the definition of non-residential gross floor area. However, this
    exception appears to have been removed for restaurants as of December 18,
    1995: see Appendix ‘A’, By-law 1996--0028. </p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText>Mr. Mathewson was not asked to clarify any of these
    matters while testifying.</p>

    an examination of the relevant plans, I see “DN” in an area leading to the
    kitchen on the plan filed in support of the May 1996 plan, but I see no similar

    was not asked for an explanation of his evidence on this point.</p>

    fairness to the provincial offences appeal court judge, it does not appear
    that the applicant tendered these documents by way of affidavit as part of
    a proper fresh evidence application in the provincial offences appeal court.

    the provincial offences appeal court judge or this court.  </p>

    there may be an outstanding issue concerning the authenticity of some portions
    of the documents tendered by the applicant on this application, any outstanding
    issue is as much the result of the City’s failure to respond to the merits
    of the fresh evidence application as it is the result of any failing on the
    applicant’s part. I will accordingly assume, for the purposes of this application
    only, that the documents are authentic in their entirety and that the City
    failed to meets its disclosure obligations by failing to produce these documents
    to the applicant prior to the re-trial.</p>

      is questionable whether the applicant adduced evidence at trial capable
      of supporting a finding that, prior to July 2, 1996, he made renovations
      increasing the size of his restaurant to more than 165 square metres of
      non residential gross floor area in accordance with building permits that
      have not been revoked. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The applicant claimed that he extended the front wall
      of his restaurant under building permit #366550 issued in 1994. However,
      the approved plan he filed as an exhibit at trial relating to this permit
      shows a proposed balcony extension and does not indicate that the front
      wall of the restaurant is to be moved. Another 1994 plan filed as an exhibit
      appears to show that the front wall of the restaurant was in fact moved,
      but that plan does not have a Building Department approval stamp. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-size:10.0pt'>The applicant called Ms. Coburn, the chief building
      official as of December 1997, as a witness at trial. Among other things,
      she testified that leading up to the December 12, 1997 meeting, the Building
      Department had concerns that the applicant had obtained previous building
      permits based on drawings that reflected prior changes that had not been
      previously approved. According to Ms. Coburn, the applicant knew that it
      was open to him to prove to City officials that he had a legal non-conforming
      use concerning the size of his restaurant but as far she was aware he did
      not take steps to do so.</span>  </p>

    this leave application, the applicant also claimed that, in the light of
    s. 34(9)(b) of the<i> Planning Act</i>, the justice of the peace erred when
    she found that the applicant was not entitled to a legal non-conforming use
    in relation to By-law 361-89 because his restaurant was not open on the day
    By-law 361-89 was passed. I agree that it appears that the justice of the
    peace erred in that respect. However, any such error is irrelevant for the
    purposes of this application because the evidence adduced at the provincial
    offences appeal court demonstrated that the applicant’s original building
    permit was for a restaurant of less than 165 square metres. In any event,
    in the provincial offences appeal court and on this application, the applicant
    claimed that By-law 361-89 is invalid. </p>
