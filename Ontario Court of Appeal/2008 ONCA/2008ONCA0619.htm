style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant appeals his conviction by a Superior Court Judge sitting alone
    and sentence for the assault and sexual assault of his stepdaughter between
    the years 1972 and 1975. The complainant was then between the ages of 12
    and 14 years.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>During
    the trial, the trial judge commented repeatedly on the Crowns failure to
    lead evidence from the complainants two older sisters about the nature of
    their relationship with the appellant. Both older sisters left the family
    home at young ages.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    his reasons for judgment the trial judge stated:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>The instant case,
    in my view, was made all the more difficult because the Crown at the preliminary
    hearing, for reasons that escape me, determined to prosecute the case without
    using all the evidence which was seemingly available to her. Apparently,
    the trial Crown proceeded along the same evidentiary path, which, in my opinion,
    limited the prosecutorial options and placed the Court in a most difficult
    position.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>He
    also said this in his reasons for judgment:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:
left'>Unfortunately, while this evidence was clearly available, I did not hear
    from either of Ms. F.s sisters about the family dynamic under which each
    of these women lived before they, themselves, left the family home to take
    up living arrangements while in their late teens at the homes of friends.
    Indeed, no attempt was made by the Crown to lead what would arguably be described
    as similar fact evidence, if it were available, of at least one sexual assault
    on the middle of Ms. F.s sisters. This strategy was regrettable, but, not
    fatal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants main contention is that the trial judge decided the case on evidence
    he believed should have been called in the trial but never was. The appellant
    contends that the trial judge relied on his tacit inference that the appellant
    sexually assaulted the complainants sisters to bolster the credibility of
    the complainant. The appellant characterizes the trial judges error as a
    misapplication of <i>W.(D.)</i>, [1991] 63 C.C.C. (3d) 397 (S.C.C.) or as
    a misapprehension of the evidence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown acknowledges that the judge was concerned about the Crowns decision
    not to lead evidence from either of the complainants sisters about the family
    dynamics in their home.  The Crown submits that what the judge said during
    the course of the trial and counsels oral submissions should be kept distinct
    from his final reasons for judgment, and that those final reasons for judgment
    indicate that his decision was based solely on the evidence admitted at trial.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    the trial judge set out the proper approach to <i>W.(D.)</i> in his recitation
    of the law, his analysis began by considering whether the evidence of the
    complainant was to be preferred to that of the appellant. He briefly commented
    negatively on the appellants selective memory, although he did not expressly
    reject the appellants evidence. He then proceeded directly to the third
    branch of <i>W.D.</i> accepting that the complainants evidence satisfied
    him of the appellants guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, even though he said
    he was left scratching my head about some of her evidence, which was either
    not developed well enough or otherwise supported by other evidence or called
    into question by an effective and understated cross examination.... He provided
    no further detail.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge also identified certain other matters he indicated were important
    to his reasoning. He said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:
left'>in my view, the events of [the older sisters] quick return to Toronto
    in the wake of a call from the complainants girlfriend, remarkably during
    hockey training camp, the complainants complete relocation to Maryland shortly
    thereafter, the retainer of solicitors by both sides to the alleged events,
    the complainants legal rather than de facto adoption by her sister and her
    then brother-in-law, the lack of reconciliation or even an attempt at the
    same by the complainants mother, who had by then essentially lost three
    daughters were more than a little telling.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge did not explain why this conduct of other members of the family
    was more than a little telling. In our view, this passage from the brief
    reasons is highly problematic.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    the fact the appellant retained a lawyer upon being accused of sexual assault
    cannot be viewed as consciousness of guilt. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    the trial judge did not indicate what he considered significant about the
    complainants sisters quick return to Toronto. On one hand, he could naturally
    infer that the sister was gravely concerned and responded urgently to the
    reported sexual assault of her younger sister. Such an inference, however,
    would not be especially telling.  On the other hand, the inference that
    the sisters immediate response is explained by her own victimization by
    the appellant would be telling, but impermissible in the absence of admissible
    evidence from the sister that she too had been physically, if not sexually,
    abused, and there was none.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Where
    a trial judges reasons are ambiguous, resort may be had to his or her interlocutory
    comments in order to better understand them. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>During
    the closing submissions of defence counsel, the trial judge commented on
    the complainants sisters quick return. He said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>... but there
    was not a hesitation on her part just to come up. So some inference, I think,
    can be drawn that she herself was quite prepared, <u>for her own historic
    connection to this gentleman</u>, to come up on a moments notice... (emphasis
    added). </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Such
    an inference would be aptly described as more than a little telling but
    was impermissible on the record. We accept the appellants contention that it
    would appear that the trial judge inferred that the sister responded immediately
    because of her own historic connection to the appellant.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third,
    the trial judges remark that the complainants mother lost three daughters is
    a further indication that he inferred that, to the mothers knowledge, the
    older sisters also suffered, or at least alleged abuse by the appellant. The
    mother did not testify and, as indicated earlier, the Crown made no attempt
    to lead similar fact evidence from the complainants sisters. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We agree
    there is an appearance from the reasons that the trial judge speculated about
    possible abuse by the appellant of the two older sisters and took that speculation
    into account when concluding that the Crown had proved the sexual assault
    of the complainant beyond a reasonable doubt. The nature of the appellants
