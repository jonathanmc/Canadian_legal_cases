style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Both
    the federal and the provincial Crowns appeal the total sentence of seven
    years, as well as the amount of the $250,000 restitution order, imposed on
    the respondent by the sentencing judge.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    her reasons, the sentencing judge canvassed the correct legal principles
    and determined that an appropriate sentence for the theft-related charges
    was one of four to five years and that the appropriate sentence for the drug-related
    charges was one of five years.  However, in her view, the principal of totality
    required a reduction of the combined consecutive sentences of nine to ten
    years to one of seven years.  In the result, the sentencing judge sentenced
    the respondent to three years for the theft charges and four years for the
    drug-related charges to be served consecutively to the theft sentence.  In
    addition, she sentenced the appellant to one year for breach of recognizance
    to be served concurrently with the drug sentence.  She also provided the
    respondent with three months of credit for his four months of pre-trial custody.  Finally,
    the sentencing judge imposed a $250,000 restitution order.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    theft charges related to the respondent's participation in stealing $2.7
    million from an armoured car.  The respondent’s role consisted of renting
    a van for the purpose of the theft, attending at the armoured vehicle, loading
    the money into the van, and departing with the money.  The theft was made
    possible because the van’s driver arranged and cooperated in the theft.  In
    the result, the respondent received at least $1 million as his share of the
    proceeds.  He did not return any of his share of the proceeds and offered
    no explanation as to its whereabouts.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Upon
    apprehension the respondent was charged with conspiracy to commit theft over
    $5,000, theft over $5,000 and possession of the proceeds of crime over $5,000.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    the respondent was released on bail on these charges and while on probation
    in relation to unrelated convictions, he sold one kilogram of cocaine to
    a member of the Hells Angels, who was in fact a police agent.  He repeated
    this offence one month later.  When he was arrested one month after that,
    the police found a further kilogram of cocaine in his possession.  It was
    clear from the circumstances of these offences that the respondent was knowledgeable
    about the drug industry.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    a result of these actions, the respondent was charged with the following
    additional offences; two charges of trafficking in cocaine, possession of
    cocaine for the purposes of trafficking, possession of the proceeds of crime
    and fail to comply with recognizance.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent, who was 31 years of age at time of sentence, had an unrelated
    record for an assault on his wife and child.  He pled guilty to all of the
    charges – both the theft and the drug-related charges at an early stage of
    the proceeding.  Mr. Bruni, the driver of the armoured vehicle, who had also
    pled guilty, but did not cooperate with the police, received a sentence of
    six years.  The other person involved in the theft received a conditional
    sentence of two years less a day in light of his early guilty plea, minor
    involvement, his return of the funds in his possession and the fact that
    his participation was uncharacteristic.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    recognize that, given the unique qualifications of a sentencing judge, broad
    discretion is shown to sentences imposed by such judges and that an appellate
    court will not intervene absent and error in principle, failure to consider
    a relevant factor, or an overemphasis of the appropriate factors.  This deference
    has recently been emphasized by the Supreme Court in <i>R. v. L.M</i> (2008),
    231 C.C.C. 310.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    our view, we see no error in principle with respect to the four to five year
    the sentence judge relating to the theft given the circumstances of the offences
    and the offender.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    in our view, the sentencing judge erred in principle with respect to the
    sentence for the drug-related offences.  In particular, the sentencing judge
    erred in relying on the decision of this Court in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Regina</i><i> v. Bajada</i>, (2003) 173 CCC 3rd 255.  In that case, Weiler
    J.A. observed at para. 13 that sentences of &quot;five to 5 1/2 years are
    not uncommon for possession of a substantial amount of cocaine for the purposes
    of trafficking following an accused's plea of guilty or where the accused
    had no prior record.&quot;  However, <i>Bajada</i> can be distinguished.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    the circumstances in <i>Bajada</i> involved a single drug transaction.  The
    respondent's culpability in this case was significantly higher given his
    conviction for two offences of trafficking, each of one kilogram of cocaine,
    one month apart.  Second, these offences were committed while the respondent
    was both on bail and on probation.  In addition, the respondent was in possession
    of a further kilogram of cocaine at the time of his arrest.  In these circumstances,
    it was an error in principle for the sentencing judge to consider a five-year
    sentence adequate.  The trafficking and possession charges related to significant
    quantities of cocaine over a three-month period, which is indicative of the
    respondent’s extensive involvement in and familiarity at a high level with
    the drug business.  In our view, the appropriate sentence for the three counts
    involving cocaine would have been eight years.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    light of this conclusion the respondent’s potential imprisonment would be
    12 to 13 years. However, it remains necessary to adjust the sentence to take
    into account the principle of totality which requires the sentencing judge
    to consider whether the total sentence is proportional to the overall culpability
    of the offender and whether the total sentence, in all the circumstances,
    would be crushing for the respondent.  The sentencing judge recognized that
    the totality principle applied at this stage of the sentencing, even though
    the offences were separate.  However, she did not explain what aspects of
    the offences or the offender justified a reduction of the aggregate sentence
    to seven years. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    our view, taking into account the seriousness of these offences, the circumstances
    of the offender and the offence, the sentence imposed on Mr. Bruni, the appropriate
    total sentence that ought to have been imposed on this offender is nine years.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    sentencing judge ordered restitution of $250,000, even though the evidence
    was clear that the respondent, who advised the court that his actions had
    been motivated by greed, had profited from the theft by at least $1 million
    and had provided no information about where the money was.  In these circumstances,
    the sentencing judge was obliged to explain why she arrived at the figure
    of $250,000.  An absence of reasons leaves this court in a position to determine
    the appropriate restitution order.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    would accordingly grant leave to appeal sentence, allow the appeal, and substitute
    a sentence of five years for the trafficking and possession charges and four
    years consecutive for the theft charges.  We would also substitute a restitution
    order of $1 million.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    would not disturb the sentence of a further one year imprisonment for breach
    of recognizance, to be served concurrently, nor the three months credit given
    for pre-trial custody.</p>
