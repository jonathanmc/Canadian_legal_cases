    Muzeen and his wife Elizabeth for $12,500, financed by a $12,000 loan from Mr.
    Muzeen’s parents.  There was originally
    one cottage on the property.  Two years
    later Mr. Muzeen’s parents built a second cottage on the property.  Mr. Muzeen’s father died a year later in 1959
    and since then his widow and their daughter Grace (sister of James Muzeen), her
    husband David Forrester and their son have used this second cottage (the
    Forrester cottage).  The original cottage
    (the Muzeen cottage) continued to be used by Mr. Muzeen and his wife Elizabeth
    and later by his daughter and her family. </p>

    the Muzeen family and their relatives, the Forresters, used their respective
    cottages from the late 1960’s to the time this action was began and that the
    Forresters had made substantial improvements, shared property taxes for part of
    that time and had otherwise conducted themselves as part owners of the land. </p>

    Elizabeth Muzeen, David Forrester proposed that a portion of the property be
    transferred to himself and Grace, in accordance with a metes and bounds
    description which he had drafted, for a price of $2,500.  The Muzeens signed back the letter, stating,
    “agreed to, with many thanks” and the sum of $2,500 was paid to them.  However, a survey and transfer were never
    prepared and the property was never conveyed.</p>

    issue at trial, and on appeal, is whether this letter of February 6, 1964
    constituted a valid and enforceable contract for the sale of this

'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  We have had a number of discussions concerning
    the new cottage at
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Clearwater
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Bay and some division
    concerning the lot. With full awareness of all of the circumstances concerning
    the building of the second cottage and the future of it, and following out the
    discussions which I have had with Jim, I think it would be useful to record now
    what I understand to be the agreement.</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:black;'>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    &nbsp;Firstly, I think it may be fairly
    expensive to have a re-survey made and probably not necessary at this time if
    the same result can be accomplished by this exchange of letters.</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:black;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The two of you own clear title to the entire
    parcel. The second cottage and the garage are located on the west end of it and
    my understanding is that you are agreeable to a portion of it being transferred
    to Grace and myself but subject, of course, to reasonable compensation for the
    area taken, and that, without resorting to survey, the boundaries of the area
    would be</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:black;'>Commencing at the southwest corner of the parcel, thence east along the
    south shore a distance of one hundred feet, thence north to the southerly limit
    taken on a reasonable sighting basis of the roadway and parallel to the western
    boundary, thence west a distance of fifty feet along the course of the existing
    roadway, being approximately perpendicular to the western boundary, thence
    north parallel to the western boundary to the waters edge and thence, of
    course, west to the northwest limit of the parcel;</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:black;'>but, with the further proviso that the roadway presently crossing the
    above described land will remain a roadway at all times at no less than its
    present width for access to the remaining property. This, in effect, gives
    frontage on
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Clearwater
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Bay of one hundred feet
    and frontage on the Bay behind of fifty feet.</span></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'><span lang=EN style='font-size:
10.0pt;color:black;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Part of the
    overall understanding, of course, is that proper compensation should be paid,
    and this brings into consideration not only the area involved but the effect it
    may have upon the remaining area. We have agreed that this is difficult to
    determine and, short of getting a professional evaluator, I am suggesting an
    overall consideration for the land of $2,500.00, and my cheque, payable to you
    both, for this amount is enclosed herewith, but I want it understood that this
    is not a final determination by any means and hope that you will feel free to
    discuss any larger amount if this does not have your entire agreement and blessing,
    and subject to that sometime in the future, we can look into the whole matter
    of a survey and transfer but, in the meantime, this should provide us with some
    established base upon which to work.</span></p>

    not constitute an enforceable contract for the sale of land; rather it was
    merely an agreement to engage in further discussions.  He held that the essential terms of a
    contract for the sale of land are an identification of the parties, the
    property and the price, in accordance with <i>McKenzie
    v. Walsh </i>(1920), 57 D.L.R. 24, (S.C.C.).  He held that the parties to this letter agreement were “obviously clear”
    and that “the letter is written to, and in fact is noted as agreed to, by Betty
    Muzeen and J.R. Muzeen”. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    the trial judge was of the view that there was uncertainty with respect to the
    description of the property.  The trial
    judge stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:10.0pt'><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt'>[91]         With respect to the property, I am not
    satisfied that the description of any property to be transferred is clear.  There is, of course, the metes and bounds
    description contained in the letter; however, that contains the provisos with
    respect to the roadway, and is also subject to the proviso of a survey.  I do not read the letter of February 1964 as
    constituting a sufficiently clear description for it to be found that the
    essential of the property description is clear, as it leaves the issue of a
    survey and transfer up in the air, and refers to “some established base upon
    which to work”.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge accepted that the appellants had
    established possession of part of the land and that they had made improvements,
    both with the respondent’s acquiescence. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge referred to the evidence of the
    surveyor who testified that the land as described in the metes and bounds
    description in the letter of February 6, 1964 did not entirely fit on the
    property.  In particular, a portion of
    the land contained in the metes and bounds description was in fact situate on
    an adjoining 66 foot Crown reserve and the Forrester cottage was totally or
    mainly on the Crown reserve.  In
    addition, the access road to the property is located on the Crown reserve.  This led the trial judge to conclude that due
    to the uncertainty surrounding the description of the land in the letter, the
    agreement could not be enforced.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge also held that the <i>Limitations Act</i> barred this action as at
    March 12th, 1970, six years after the acceptance noted by the Muzeens on the
    February 1964 letter.  He stated:</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I am of the opinion that the trial judge erred
    in his application of the <i>Limitations Act</i>.  The triggering event for the running of the
    limitation period occurred when the cause of action arose.  In the case of a breach of contract claim,
    this is the time at which the breach of contract occurred.  Given the judge’s finding that there was no
    aspect of “time of the essence” in this contract and his finding that on the
    evidence no demand to convey the lands was made by the appellants until 2002 at
    the earliest, no limitation period would begin to run until that point. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is unclear from the trial judge’s reasons
    whether uncertainty as to the price contributed to his conclusion that the
    letter did not give rise to an enforceable contract.  The trial judge did state that “there is
    nothing in the evidence to suggest that $2,500 was not a fair price”.  He also found that this sum was paid to Mr.
    and Mrs. Muzeen and price was never discussed again by the parties,
    notwithstanding Mr. Forrester’s statement in the February 6, 1964 letter that
    he would discuss a larger amount if his proposal did not have their (the
    Muzeen’s) entire agreement. I am of the opinion that there was an agreement as
    to the price and that on reviewing the trial judge’s reasons as a whole, he
    seems to have reached the same conclusion. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellants principal submission is that the
    trial judge erred in law in his conclusion that there was no contract due to
    the problems with the metes and bounds description of the land in the February
    6, 1964 letter.  They acknowledge the
    fact that the metes and bounds description, when put on a survey/reference
    plan, cannot fit on the parcel of land as described in the letter agreement
    because it included parts of the Crown reserve which is not owned by the
    respondent.  However, they submit that
    this does not render the contract unenforceable.  The appellants rely on the principle that
    purchasers may obtain specific performance even where the vendor is not able to
    convey the property as agreed.  In
    particular, purchasers may choose to take whatever the vendor has, even if it
    is less than the property described in the agreement, as in the case at hand. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I am of
    the opinion that the appellants’ submission on this point is correct and the
    trial judge should have allowed the appellants to accept a conveyance of that
    part of the property contained in the metes and bounds description which the
    respondent is able to convey.  The trial
    judge acknowledged that in general, where a vendor cannot convey the property
    as agreed, the purchasers may take whatever the vendor has.  He stated at paragraph 106:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:10.0pt'>[106]  Mr. Carten has relied on <i>John Beatty Farms Limited v. Stevenson Estate, Murphy v. Horne, supra, </i>and <i>Wilson Lumber Company v. Simpson, supra,</i> as authority that if the vendor cannot convey the property as agreed, the
    purchasers may take whatever the vendor has.  I clearly accept that as the law; however, those cases are
    distinguishable on the basis that each of those cases involved the division of
    a specific and easily-identifiable piece of land, where the limits were
    apparent.  They did not deal, as this
    case does, with the issue of severing off a portion of lands where the dispute
    is focused not on how much land is being transferred, but on a description of
    the land itself.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge correctly observed that in the
    three cases he referred to, the issue was a perceived shortage in the amount of
    land to be conveyed.  Nevertheless, I am
    of the opinion that the same principle should apply in the circumstances of
    this case, particularly having regard to the appellants’ willingness to accept
    a conveyance of that part of the land which the respondent can convey, their
    long usage of the property with the acquiescence of the respondent, the sharing
    of property taxes and the improvements which they made to the property.  This principle is stated in Donahue, D.J.,

    a plan of survey which he had prepared.  Part I of this survey delineated the description of the property as set
    out in the 1964 letter agreement as it related to the land registered to James
    Muzeen and excluded that part of the description which encompassed the
    adjoining Crown reserve.  It can be
    concluded from the trial judge’s reasons and from the record on appeal that had
    the trial judge considered the letter agreement to be enforceable, he would
    have ordered specific performance of the agreement as it related to the lands
    described in Part I of the Johnson survey. </p>

    particular an obligation to grant an easement in the event that they, in
    future, purchase the Crown reserve adjacent to the lands to be conveyed in the
    vesting order.  This responds to an issue
    raised at trial as to the unfairness of the appellants’ potentially purchasing
    part of the road allowance on the Crown reserve in such a way as to obstruct
    the respondent’s access to his property.  The suggested conditions would obviate that problem and are clearly for
    the benefit of both parties.  I would
    include the conditions set out in Part V of the appellants’ factum, as
    conditions of the vesting order. </p>

    costs order to stand.  The appellants are
