  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal is from the order of Justice Allen striking
    out large portions of the defendants’ statement of defence and staying certain
    portions of their counterclaim.  The
    action arises in the context of a dispute between a franchisor and its franchisees.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I would allow the
    appeal.  Respectfully, in my view, the
    motion judge misapplied the test for striking out portions of a pleading and
    erred in applying the test for staying portions of the counterclaim.</p>
  <h3>Facts</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The plaintiff, Quizno’s, is the franchisor and licensor
    of Quizno’s Restaurants in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  Its franchisees are in the business of
    selling submarine-style sandwiches and related products according to Quizno’s
    franchise system.  Currently, there are
    over 400 Quizno’s Submarine Sandwich restaurants in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    .</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Five of these restaurants – located in the
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Atlantic Provinces – are
    owned by the defendant Kileel Developments Ltd. (“KDL”).  John Kileel is the president, and Jonathan
    Talbot-Kelly an employee, of KDL.  Together
    I shall refer to these defendants as “the KDL Defendants”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In December 2000 KDL became an Area Director for
    Quizno’s with responsibility for the Atlantic Provinces of Nova Scotia,
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    New Brunswick and
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Prince
    Edward Island (“the Territory”).  Pursuant to the Area Director Marketing
    Agreement (the “ADMA”) giving effect to this arrangement, KDL was responsible
    primarily for (a) soliciting prospective Quizno’s franchisees for the Territory
    (“sales services”), (b) performing site acquisition and development services
    (“site services”), and (c) rendering support and other services to restaurant
    franchisees in the Territory (“support services”).  It was also responsible for developing a
    graduated number of new franchises in the Territory – either its own or others
    – over the period of the agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The KDL Defendants plead that the reciprocal
    obligations of Quizno’s under the ADMA included not only the payment of
    commissions for the foregoing services, but also – among other things – the
    obligations to provide training to KDL and its employees and to provide operating
    assistance in the form of advice relating to franchise sales, support and
    assistance.  They plead as well that the
    obligations and responsibilities as between them and Quizno’s are governed by
    their franchise agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2006, Quizno’s franchisees across the country became
    restless because they were unsatisfied with the prices being charged by
    Quizno’s suppliers.  Under their
    franchise agreements they are required to purchase supplies from designated or
    approved suppliers.  About one hundred of
    them joined a newly-formed association called Denver Subs Canadian Franchisee
    Association (“Denver Subs”).  Mr.
    Talbot-Kelly became the acting president of that Association.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the temporary leader of Denver Subs, Mr.
    Talbot-Kelly took certain positions and made certain demands that irritated
    Quizno’s.  In the same period – May, 2006
    – two Ontario Quizno’s franchisees commenced an intended class proceeding (“the
    Class Action”) on behalf of all Quizno’s Canadian franchisees seeking damages
    for alleged breach of contract, breach of duty of fair dealing and price
    fixing.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All of this was too much for Quizno’s, apparently.  They commenced this action claiming a
    declaration that the ADMA had been terminated and seeking damages against KDL,
    Mr. Kileel and Mr. Talbot-Kelly.  In
    essence, Quizno’s alleges that Mr. Talbot-Kelly, in his capacity as acting
    president of Denver Subs, acted in a manner that was contrary to Quizno’s
    interests and in breach of many of the provisions of the ADMA, and that KDL is
    vicariously responsible for this conduct. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I observe in completing this outline of the background
    that neither KDL nor Mr. Kileel nor Mr. Talbot-Kelly is a party to the Class Action.  It had not been certified at the time of the
    motion before Justice Allen and, in fact, an order was made prior to the
    hearing of this appeal refusing to certify the proceeding as a class action.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  This is significant because much of the
    motion judge’s reasoning – particularly on the stay motion – was premised on
    the view that there were common issues between this action and the class
    proceeding.</p>
  <h3>Law and Analysis</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge struck paragraphs 30(c), 33, 37, 41-46,
    48-57, 62-64, 67-68 and 71-72 of the statement of defence and stayed paragraphs
    105(b) and (c), 112(b), (c), (d), (f), (g) and (h), and 129(e) of the counterclaim.  She concluded that the paragraphs in the statement
    of defence were relevant and were neither frivolous, vexatious nor an abuse of
    process, but that their prejudicial effect outweighed what she considered to be
    their probative value.  To the extent
    they related to the issue of food pricing (paragraphs 45-46 and 48-51) they
    were duplicative of the allegations in the Class Action.  In her view, it was “not necessary” for the
    KDL Defendants to plead in the detail they did and they “[could] raise a
    reasonable defence without the impugned paragraphs” (reasons, para. 31).  She found that the allegations attacked in the
    counterclaim were essentially duplicative of the allegations in the Class Action
    and that, while the KDL Defendants had not been named in that proceeding, they
    would be embraced by it if it were certified.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the motion judge erred with respect to both
    of these determinations.</p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>The
    Statement of Defence</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rule 25.11 states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The court may strike out or expunge all or part of
    a pleading or other document, with or without leave to amend, on the ground
    that the pleading or other document,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>may prejudice or delay the fair trial of the action;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious; or</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>is an abuse of the process of the court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A pleading cannot be “scandalous” if it is relevant,
    and given her findings noted above, the motion judge must have based her
    decision on the ground that the impugned portions of the statement of defence “may
    prejudice or delay the fair trial of the action.”  Before analysing the portions of the pleading
    by category, she stated her general conclusion as follows (para. 28):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I do not agree with Quizno’s position
    that the impugned paragraphs … are irrelevant, frivolous, vexatious or an abuse
    of process.  However, I do accept those
    paragraphs should be struck as being of limited probative value in relation to
    allegations in the Action and because the prejudice of maintaining these
    paragraphs outweighs their probative value.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A court may strike out portions of a pleading, even
    where the allegations are relevant, if the applicant can establish that they
    are of marginal probative value and their probative value is outweighed by their
    prejudicial effect.  Before doing so, a
    judge must balance the rights of the parties on the particular facts of the
    case and must consider carefully the extent to which the particulars attacked
    are necessary to enable the defendant to prove its case and their probative
    value in establishing that case: see <i>Clement
    v. McGuinty</i> (2001), 18 C.P.C. (5<sup>th</sup>) 267 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), at paras. 21-24; <i>Asper v. Lantos</i> (2000), 51 O.R. (3d) 215
    (
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Div. Ct.),
    at paras. 18-20; <i>Lee v. Globe and Mail</i> (2001), 52 O.R. (3d) 652 (S.C.), at paras. 11 and 14.  Where the allegations in question are
    relevant and material, however, the court should exercise this power with
    considerable caution, in my view.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pleadings are not the appropriate stage in an action to
    engage at large in what is essentially a trial judge’s exercise for determining
    the <i>admissibility of evidence at trial</i> – i.e., weighing the probative value versus prejudice of facts.  That exercise is not particularly well-suited
    to <i>defining issues for trial</i>,
    something which is for the parties to decide.  Rule 25.11 provides that the pleading may be struck if it “may prejudice <i>the fair</i> trial of the action.”  A fair trial requires that the defendant be
    able to put forward a “full” defence, not – as the motion judge erroneously
    concluded – a “reasonable” defence defined in advance by the plaintiff and the
    court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These parameters are consistent with the view expressed
    by MacFarland J. (as she then was) in <i>Asper, </i>at para. 20:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Pizza Pizza was concerned with whether a defendant
    could plead alternative defamatory meanings by way of justification, not the
    sufficiency of such a plea.  In our view,
    Pizza Pizza <i>does not stand for the
    proposition that it is open to a court to strike a pleading or particulars in a
    libel action where they are relevant, necessary and of reasonable probative
    value to the defendant</i> on the ground that such a plea is “oppressive”.  On the other hand, where a plea is strictly
    speaking relevant, but <i>of marginal
    probative value</i>, and would be onerous for a plaintiff, it may well be found
    to offend the rules. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For purposes of  analysis, the motion judge grouped the paragraphs she struck by general
    category, namely:</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
&quot;Courier New&quot;'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Allegations
    regarding the existence and terms of the franchise agreements (paragraphs
    30(c), 33, 37, 41-44, 52-57, 62-64, 67-68 and 71-72)</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
&quot;Courier New&quot;'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Allegations
    regarding food pricing and the cost of supplies (paragraphs 45-46 and 48-51)</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
&quot;Courier New&quot;'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Allegations
    regarding Denver Subs (paragraphs 52-57)</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An examination of the pleading demonstrates that the
    motion judge struck portions of the pleading that were considerably more than
    “of marginal probative value” to the defendants and of little prejudice to the
    plaintiff.  Indeed, in some instances at
    least, they went to the very heart of the defence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The thrust of Quizno’s claim is that after Mr.
    Talbot-Kelly assumed his leadership position with Denver Subs he “acted in a
    manner that [was] contrary to Quizno’s interests and [was] in breach of many
    terms of the [ADMA]”, and that KDL is vicariously liable for those acts (statement
    of claim, paras. 17-18).  The thrust of
    the defence is that the rights and obligations as between Quizno’s and the KDL
    Defendants are defined in both the ADMA and their franchise agreements, that
    the two are inter-related, and that they (the KDL Defendants) were only acting
    in accordance with those rights and obligations but that Quizno’s was not, and
    accordingly that Quizno’s was neither entitled to terminate the ADMA nor to
    recover damages.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The allegations concerning the franchise agreements,
    and their effect on the legal relationship between the parties under the ADMA,
    are designed to establish that Quizno’s was not entitled to terminate the ADMA,
    as I read them.  For example, paragraph
    34 of the statement of defence pleads:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The defendants further state
    and the fact is that the duties owed by KDL to [Quizno’s] under the ADMA, and
    in particular any “duty of loyalty” proffered by the plaintiff, must be
    interpreted narrowly in light of and subject to the fact that [Quizno’s]
    recruited KDL as Area Director <i>with the
    explicit understanding that KDL would be exercising rights it had acquired
    under the ADMA to become a franchisee in its own right</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge neither considers nor explains how
    that allegation – which was neither attacked nor struck – can be permitted to
    stand but the defendants be precluded from pleading the facts relating to the
    franchise agreements that underpin such an allegation.  Even though the plaintiff pleads that the KDL
    Defendants breached their obligations to Quizno’s and to Quizno’s franchisees
    in its role as Area Director, the motion judge concluded that it was “not <i>necessary</i> for the KDL Defendants to
    plead <i>in such detail</i> the terms of the
    franchisee agreements” as they did in the portions of the pleading under attack
    (paragraph 30).  They could raise “a
    reasonable defence” without them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This approach constituted an error in principle.  The impugned paragraphs contain pleadings of
    material facts.  They are not prolix, nor
    are they pleadings of evidence.  A
    defendant is entitled to plead whatever material facts it chooses to in response
    to a plaintiff’s allegations, provided the allegations are relevant and of at
    least marginal probative value and their probative value is not outweighed by
    their prejudicial effect.  While the
    court will look at “[the extent to which] the particulars attacked are
    necessary to enable the defendant to prove its case,”<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a> it is not for the court to prune the case at this stage and limit the
    allegations to what it considers a “reasonable defence”.  Moreover, even if the motion judge were
    applying the test that weighs relevance and probative value of the allegations,
    on the one hand, against prejudice, on the other, she made a palpable and
    overriding error in concluding that the impugned allegations were of only
    limited or marginal probative value.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For example, paragraph 37 of the statement of defence pleads
    that KDL is entitled to hire any persons it sees fit in the operation of its
    franchise.  This allegation is in direct
    response to the plaintiff’s plea in paragraph 11(f) of the statement of claim
    that the ADMA gives Quizno’s “sole discretion” to determine who is fit or unfit
    to represent them in marketing its restaurants or furnishing services to its
    franchisees.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly, paragraphs 41-44, which relate to Article
    13.4 of the franchise agreements, raise a direct defence to the plaintiff’s
    claim that the KDL Defendants were acting in breach of their obligations by
    asserting a position contrary to that of Quizno’s regarding supplier
    pricing.  The paragraphs allege that the
    franchise agreements permit the KDL Defendants to engage in direct discussions
    with suppliers and to request a change in suppliers, and that Quizno’s is
    obliged to consider and evaluate such a request in good faith.  The thrust of paragraphs 48-51 is that Quizno’s
    declined to respond to the KDL Defendants’ attempt – in their dual capacity as area
    manager and franchisee – to deal with these problems.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Paragraphs 41-51 relate to the food pricing issue.  The motion judge struck those allegations as
    well on the ground that they were duplicative of the issues in the Class Action.  This, too, was an error in principle in my
    view.  The KDL Defendants were not
    parties to the Class Action.  The Class Action
    had not been certified (and, in fact, was not).  In any event, the KDL Defendants were not bound to participate in the
    class proceeding but would have been at liberty to opt out and pursue the claim
    asserted in the counterclaim.  Moreover,
    even if the Class Action had been certified, the KDL Defendants should not have
    been deprived of their right to assert these allegations <i>by way of defence</i> to the claim put forward by Quizno’s in this
    action.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In paragraph 17 of the statement of claim Quizno’s
    pleads that Mr. Talbot-Kelly assumed leadership of Denver Subs, an association
    “formed by Quizno’s franchisees to lobby Quizno’s regarding desired changes to
    the franchise system”.  Paragraph 18 sets
    out particulars of how Mr. Talbot-Kelly is alleged to have acted “contrary to
    Quizno’s interests” and to have been “in breach of many terms of the [ADMA]” in
    his capacity as “vocal spokesperson for the Association”.  In addition to their allegations in
    paragraphs 41-51 of the statement of defence – dealt with above – the KDL
    Defendants plead the facts underlying the establishment of Denver Subs, the
    steps undertaken by Denver Subs to deal with the food pricing issue, and
    Quizno’s negative response to those efforts, in paragraphs 52-57.  The motion judge struck those paragraphs as
    well.  But, as I appreciate their thrust,
    they are a direct response to issues put in play by the plaintiff in paragraphs
    17 and 18 of the statement of claim and are in furtherance of the KDL
    Defendants’ basic position that it is Quizno’s, and not they, which is in
    breach of the ADMA and which is therefore “disentitle[d] … to require strict compliance
    with the ADMA from the defendants” (statement of defence, para. 40).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The same analysis applies to paragraphs 62-64, 67-68
    and 71-72 – also struck by the motion judge.  Paragraphs 62-64 relate to a memorandum dated May 11, 2006, circulated
    by Mr. Talbot-Kelly, and pleaded in paragraph 18(a) of the statement of claim
    to be an example of the KDL Defendants’ breach of the ADMA.  Paragraphs 67-68 respond to the allegations
    in paragraph 18(b) of the statement of claim respecting a memorandum dated May
    15, 2006.  In addition, paragraph 69 of
    the statement of defence – which was not attacked – is meaningless without the
    lead-up explanation contained in paragraphs 67-68.  Paragraphs 71-72 respond directly to similar
    allegations in paragraph 18(c) of the statement of claim regarding another
    memorandum dated May 18, 2006.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether the various allegations that are attacked
    prevail at trial is not the point.  Respectfully,
    it is simply a palpable and overriding error to find that the allegations in
    the impugned paragraphs in the statement of defence were of little probative
    value, much less of marginal probative value, and prejudicial.  A plaintiff cannot claim to be prejudiced
    when the defendant’s allegations are directly responsive to allegations made in
    its statement of claim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the motion judge purported to apply the
    prejudice vs. probative value test articulated in <i>Asper </i>she misconstrued that test – and the limited circumstances in
    which it should be applied – in my view, and instead applied a test that calls
    upon the court to decide whether material and relevant allegations pleaded may
    nonetheless be struck because it is “not necessary” to plead them in order to
    “raise a reasonable defence”.  This
    constituted an error in principle.</p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>The Counterclaim</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge struck paragraphs 105(b) and (c), 112
    (b), (c), (d), (f), (g) and (h) and 129(e) of the counterclaim.  These claims relate to allegations of breach
    of the ADMA by Quizno’s in connection with the supplier/pricing dispute between
    KDL, other franchisees, and Quizno’s.  They were struck primarily on the basis of the court’s desire to avoid
    the multiplicity of proceedings and to stay proceedings where common issues are
    being litigated in more than one proceeding: <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, ss. 106 and 138; <i>Class Proceedings Act</i>, 1992, S.O. 1992,
    c. 6, s. 13; Rule 6.01 of the <i>Rules of
    Civil Procedure</i>.  The motion judge
    was of the view that the same issues were being litigated in the Class Action
    commenced by the two Ontario Quizno’s franchisees.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The KDL Defendants were not parties to the Class Action.  Those proceedings had not yet been certified
    and, as noted above – subsequent to the argument before the motion judge but
    prior to argument of this appeal – the Superior Court refused to certify them.  It could not be said with any confidence that
    the KDL Defendants would or would not opt out of the Class Action pursuant to
    s. 9 of the <i>Class Proceedings Act</i>,
    1992, and therefore whether they would or would not be bound by the findings in
    that proceeding.  The motion judge’s
    decision was premature and an error in principle at the then existing stages of
    the two proceedings, in my opinion.  </p>
  <h3>Disposition</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For all of the foregoing reasons, I would allow the
    appeal and set aside the order of the motion judge striking out paragraphs
    30(c), 33, 37, 41-46, 48-57, 62-64, 67-68 and 71-72 of the statement of defence
    and staying paragraphs 105(b) and (c), 112 (b), (c), (d), (f), (g), (h) and
    129(e) of the counterclaim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants are entitled to their costs of the
    appeal, fixed in the amount of $15,000 inclusive of fees, GST and
    disbursements.  The appellants are also
    entitled to costs below, fixed in the same amount set by the motion judge,
