    bag containing $450,000 CAD for three certified cheques drawn on the USD
    account of Friedberg &amp; Co. Inc. (Friedberg), a local currency exchange and brokerage.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>About four months after he received the certified
    cheques, Esses deposited them in an account set up at the Toronto Branch of
    Bank Leumi.  The ultimate destination of
    the funds was an account Esses maintained in Bank Leumi in

    cheque proceeds.  Within days, however,
    the Bank of Montreal (BMO), the bank on which the certified cheques had been
    drawn, directed that payment on the cheques be stopped. Bank Leumi reversed the
    credit to Esses’ account.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Esses sued BMO and Friedberg, demanding payment of the
    certified cheques.  The Bank defended,
    cross-claimed against Friedberg and counterclaimed against Esses.  Friedberg defended and cross-claimed  against BMO.</p>

    setting aside the summary judgment against it and dismissing Esses’ motion for
    summary judgment.  In the alternative,
    BMO seeks an order adjourning Esses’ motion for summary judgment to permit BMO
    to bring a motion before a Master to compel Esses to respond to questions
    improperly refused in his cross-examination on the original motion.  BMO also seeks leave to amend its statement
    of defence.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The story begins with the fraudulent sale of a
    residential property, financed by a mortgage issued by BMO to the counterfeit
    purchaser.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ann and William Yawylak have owned their Etobicoke home
    for over 40 years.  For more than a
    decade, they have lived mortgage-free. The couple spend the first quarter of
    each year at their
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Florida
    winter home, leaving supervision of their Etobicoke property to their son Gary.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In late February or early March, 2004, Gary Yawylak
    found a utility bill at his parents’ home.  The bill was addressed to “William Babineau” at the same address.  Suspicious, Gary Yawylak made some
    inquiries.  Shortly, he and his parents learned
    that the couple’s home had been “sold” to William Babineau and that the
    property was now subject to a $459,000 mortgage held by BMO.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sale of the Etobicoke property had been
    accomplished, the mortgage given and funds advanced under it on the basis of a
    series of forgeries.  The “sale” closed
    on February 12, 2004.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>            The Mortgage Funds</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On February 13, 2004, the counterfeit William Yawylak opened
    an account at a branch of CIBC.  He produced
    a forged social insurance card and
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario
    driver’s licence in his assumed name. The imposter deposited a lawyer’s trust
    account cheque for $498,488.64, payable to William Yawylak,  to plenish the account.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On February 16, 2004, the imposter withdrew $450,000.00
    to purchase a CIBC bank draft payable to Friedberg.  The remitter’s name on the draft is William
    Yawylak, the duplicate, not the original.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>            <b>The
    Friedberg Deposit</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According to Benguigui, Lee and Malanca, two men with
    whom Benguigui had had previous dealings, approached him to help them convert
    the CIBC bank draft in Canadian dollars to cheques in American dollars. Ultimately,
    Lee and Malanca wanted cash. The draft represented the proceeds of a real
    estate transaction.  Lee and Malanca also
    had a letter from a lawyer, which they said, again according to Benguigui,
    explained the circumstances of the transaction.  Benguigui agreed to help them for a commission of 3%.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Benguigui took the CIBC bank draft to Friedberg on
    February 17, 2004. He had been approached by Esses who had cash he (Esses)
    wanted to exchange for certified USD cheques. The draft, payable to Friedberg,
    was for $450,000 CAD.  The remitter was
    William Yawylak.  Friedberg wanted to
    verify the authenticity of the draft and Benguigui’s authority to tender it for
    deposit.  After all, Benguigui was not William
    Yawylak.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Benguigui telephoned Yawylak, the imposter, who faxed
    to Friedberg the necessary authority and (forged) identification.  Friedberg verified the legitimacy of the
    draft with CIBC and accepted the draft from Benguigui.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The
    Friedberg Cheques</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Friedberg, following Benguigui’s instructions, prepared
    three cheques payable to “S. Asis”.  The
    cheques were drawn on Friedberg’s USD account at BMO.  Two cheques were for $115,000.00 USD, the
    third for $112,980.18 USD. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Benguigui took the Friedberg cheques to BMO where he
    had each certified by a member of the bank staff.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The Cash for
    Cheques Exchange</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Benguigui left the bank and drove to Esses’ office
    where he exchanged the cheques for $450,000 CAD in cash.  Esses delivered the money in a shopping bag.  He did not ask for, nor did Benguigui provide
    a receipt for the cash.  Esses paid
    Benguigui a commission of $8,000.00 for his assistance.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Benguigui delivered the shopping bag of cash to Lee and
    Malanca, who had agreed to pay Benguigui a commission of 3%.  Benguigui never received his commission.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Depositing
    the Cheques</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On June 24, 2004, more than four months after he had
    received the certified Friedberg cheques from Benguigui, Esses took them to the
    only
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto branch of Bank Leumi, a
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Luxembourg</st1:country-region>
    financial institution.  The deposit was
    credited to Esses’ account in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Luxembourg</st1:country-region>
    .  On the instructions of BMO, however, the
    credit was reversed days later on the ground that the funds were derived from
    fraud.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The Recovery
    Efforts</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After Esses learned of the reversal of his deposit at
    Bank Leumi, he and Benguigui went to the head office of BMO to find out why the
    original credit had been reversed despite the fact that the deposit consisted
    of cheques that BMO had itself certified.  BMO did not resile from its position that the funds used in the
    underlying transaction had been obtained by fraud.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Esses and Benguigui returned to BMO to pursue Esses’
    request for restoration of his credit for the face value of the certified
    cheques.  On this occasion, November 30,
    2004, both men were arrested for defrauding BMO.  About a year later, on December 4, 2005, the
    Crown withdrew the fraud charge against Esses.  One month later, Esses sued BMO and Friedberg.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE DECISION OF THE MOTION
    JUDGE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge was faced with three motions scheduled
    for hearing on the same day:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'>i.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Esses’ motion for summary judgment on his claim against
    BMO;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'>ii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Friedberg’s motion for dismissal of Esses’ claim and
    BMO’s cross claim against it;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'>iii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>BMO’s motion for leave to amend the statement of
    defence and an adjournment of Esses’ motion to permit BMO to compel Esses to
    answer questions and produce documents previously refused on cross-examination.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge concluded that there was no evidence;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'>i.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that Esses participated in any part of the mortgage
    fraud that produced the funds involved; or</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'>ii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that Friedberg knew that the CIBC bank draft
    represented the proceeds of fraud.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>The motion
    judge concluded that Esses was a <i>bona fide</i> holder of the certified cheques, thus was entitled to their proceeds.  By its certification of the cheques, BMO
    released Friedberg from any liability. The only party liable on the certified
    cheques was BMO.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge dismissed BMO’s motion for leave to
    amend its statement of defence.  Rule
    25.06(8) requires full particulars of the material facts that underlie a
    pleading of fraud.  BMO provided no
    particulars of a fraud alleged, and the record disclosed no evidence that Esses
    was in any way complicit in any fraud perpetrated by others.  Esses’ refusals to answer various questions
    or produce requested documents on discovery were fully justified and cannot
    furnish a basis upon which to amend BMO’s statement of defence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge concluded that the only party liable
    to Esses was BMO, which had certified the cheques of its customer, Friedberg.
    In the result, the motion judge dismissed Esses’ claim and BMO’s cross claim
    against Friedberg.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>BMO says that the motion judge erred in three respects:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>i.          by granting summary
    judgment to Esses;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>ii.         by failing to grant
    BMO leave to amend its statement of defence;          and</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal'>iii.       by failing
    to adjourn the hearing of Esses’ summary judgment motion to permit BMO to
    obtain an order to compel responses from Esses for questions not answered in
    materials not provided on discovery.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In her decision on the motion for summary judgment, the
    motion judge found that there was no genuine issue for trial.  BMO contends that this finding is flawed
    because the motion judge tried the issue joined between BMO and Esses and made
    her own findings of fact, rather than consider whether the evidence raised a
    triable issue about Esses’ knowledge of, if not complicity in, the spurious
    origins of the Friedberg cheques.  These
    findings were unfair to BMO because the findings thwarted BMO’s efforts to
    adduce further evidence to complete the record and confirm that there were
    genuine issues for trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To begin, BMO submits, there was a triable issue about Esses’
    participation in, or at the very least, his knowledge of, the spurious origins
    of the funds used to purchase the Friedberg cheques of which he gained
    possession.  A convenient bag of
    cash.  In just the right amount.  In not one, but three cheques.  No receipts.  An offshore deposit, four months later.  A series of transactions, close together, the ultimate object of which
    was to cleanse funds illegally obtained.  Each participant had a role to perform.  At the very least, the circumstances left open a variety of inferences
    for a trier of fact.  It was not for the
    motion judge to deprive the trier of fact of its due.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>BMO further argues that the motion judge misapplied the
    burden of proof in connection with Esses’ claim that he was a holder in due
    course, or a holder for value of the Friedberg certified cheques.  It was for Esses to prove in the main action
    that he gave value for the cheques, and did so in good faith.  It was not for BMO to prove that Esses gave
    no value, or did not act in good faith. Each issue was controverted and, by
    misplacing the onus, the motion judge wrongly converted what was contested into
    something that was not triable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Esses adopts a contrary stance.  BMO has it all wrong.  The motion judge did not find that Esses was
    a holder in due course of a bill of exchange.  She grounded Esses’ entitlement on the basis that he was the payee of
    three cheques that BMO had certified.  BMO could not refuse to honour cheques it had certified.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Esses concedes that BMO could resist payment by proving
    that the certification had been obtained by fraud to which Esses was a party,
    or at least of which he was aware.  But
    there was no evidence before the motions judge, thus no triable issue, that Esses
    himself obtained the certification by fraud, or connived with others, for
    example, Benguigui, Lee or Malanca, to do so.  Neither was there any evidence to support an inference of Esses’
    participation in the original fraudulent house sale and mortgage financing
    scheme.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Esses says that to fund the argument that there are
    triable issues about his knowledge of or participation in the fraudulent scheme
    to obtain money and launder the proceeds, BMO relies upon his (Esses’) refusals
    to answer and produce records to substantiate his claim.  These refusals, eminently proper, cannot
    amount to evidence on which BMO can rely to support its assertion on a factual
    controversy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Esses takes issue with BMO’s submission that whether Esses
    actually had $450,000 CAD in cash in a bag to exchange for the certified
    cheques is of no legal consequence in this case.  Equally irrelevant is BMO’s submission that Esses’
    accumulation of the funds to evade both income and goods and services taxes
    disentitled him to recover on the certified cheques. Esses was, at bottom, the
    payee of each of three cheques certified by BMO.  Certification obliges BMO to pay, at least in
    the absence of evidence of Esses’ knowledge of or participation in the
    fraudulent scheme by which the monies were originally obtained.  Nothing raises a triable issue about Esses’
    knowledge or participation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As for BMO’s motion for leave to amend its statement of
    defence, Esses says the motion was rightly dismissed.  The purpose of the amendment was to advance a
    new theory in defence, tax evasion as a source of Esses’ funds to exchange for
    the certified cheques, in its turn thus disentitling Esses to claim as a holder
    in due course.  The proposed amendment,
    an allegation of fraud, is sought without any supportive affidavit or other
    evidentiary foundation: in essence, theory only.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion to amend was rightly refused on another
    basis: abuse of process.  The motion for
    summary judgment had been set for argument for several months.  The motion to amend drifted in late and was
    little less than a tactical manoeuvre to derail the motion for summary
    judgment.  Leave to amend was rightly
    refused.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The principal issue that divides the parties concerns
    the correctness of the motion judge’s decision to grant summary judgment in
    favour of Esses.  If BMO succeeds in its
    attack on the decision granting summary judgment to Esses, the motion to amend,
    as well as any other motion to compel response to discovery questions and
    production of documents, may be reinvigorated.</p>

    issue for trial”.  At paragraph 22,
    Morden A.C.J.O. concluded: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>¶22      It is
    safe to say that “genuine” means not spurious and, more specifically, that the
    words “for trial” assist in showing the meaning of the term.  If the evidence on a motion for summary
    judgment satisfies the court that there is no issue of fact which requires a
    trial for its resolution, the requirements of the rule have been met.  It must be clear that a trial is
    unnecessary.  The burden is on the moving
    party to satisfy the court that the requirements of the rule have been
    met.  Further, it is important to keep in
    mind that the court’s function is not to resolve an issue of fact but to
    determine whether a genuine issue of fact exists.  (See 6

    Federal Practice, 2<sup>nd</sup> ed. (1987 release), p. 56-391; Wright, Miller

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>Ungerman </i>court
    found two other requirements implicit in r. 20.04(2).  In paragraph 16, Morden A.C.J.O. described
    these implicit requirements:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>¶16      Our
    rule does not contain, after “genuine issue”, the additional words “as to any material
    fact”. Such a requirement is implicit.  If a fact is not material to an action, in the sense that the result of
    the proceeding does not turn on its existence or non-existence, then it cannot
    relate to a “genuine issue for trial”. (See Wright, Miller and Kane, Federal
    Practice and Procedure, 2<sup>nd</sup> ed. (1983), vol. 10A, pp. 93-95.)
    Similar reasoning applies to the absence from our rule of the words “and the
    moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law”.  This is implicit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Ungerman</i> reminds us of two other points of importance in connection with motions for
    summary judgment.  The first
    distinguishes between identification of issues of fact on the one hand, and
    resolution of issues of fact, on the other.  The function of a judge on a motion for summary judgment is to determine
    whether a genuine issue exists about any material fact.  Once having determined that such an issue
    exists, it is not for the motion judge to resolve that issue, for that is the
    task of the trier of fact at trial.  The
    second point of importance that emerges from <i>Ungerman</i> is that, at least as a sensible general proposition, if
    there is an issue of credibility, a trial is required, and summary judgment
    should not be granted.  <i>Ungerman</i> at para. 24.  The issue of credibility must, of course, be
    genuine, not contrived.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On a motion for summary judgment, the motion judge must
    bear in mind the placement and substance of the onus on the parties to the
    motion.  The moving party, here Esses,
    bears the legal or persuasive burden to satisfy the court that there is no
    genuine issue for trial before summary judgment can be granted.  <i>Hi-Tech
    Group Inc. v. Sears Canada Inc.</i>, [2001] O.J. No. 33 (C.A.) at para.
    30.  The responding party assumes an
    evidentiary burden, or something similar, to respond with evidence setting out
    specific facts showing that there is a genuine issue for trial.  But, failure of the responding party to
    tender evidence does not automatically result in summary judgment.  <i>Hi-Tech </i>at para. 30.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The nature of the “evidential burden” imposed on a
    responding party to a summary judgment motion warrants brief mention.  The “evidential burden” involves the
    presentation of evidence, whether affidavit or other material, capable of
    supporting the position advanced by the responding party. The responding party
    may not rest his or her defence on unsupported defence allegations or denials, but
    may nonetheless urge that the moving party’s claim as supported by affidavit,
    is so obviously deficient that it raises a triable issue about the moving
    party’s right to succeed.  <i>Hi-Tech</i> at para. 30.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sometimes, the issue on a summary judgment motion upon
    which the parties divide has to do with knowledge.  At times, knowledge, or more broadly, state
    of mind, is a notoriously difficult fact for a party to prove. Especially a
    party opposite to the party whose knowledge or state of mind is in issue.  Knowledge need not, for that matter in many
    instances cannot, be proven by direct evidence. Circumstantial evidence is a
    perfectly acceptable means of proving knowledge, indeed is the most common
    currency for doing so.  Frequently, proof
    of knowledge is much better canvassed by a trial judge, with the benefit of <i>viva voce</i> evidence, than by a motion
    judge on an arid printed record.

    follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            (2)  In particular, the title of a person who

    admitted or proven that acceptance of the bill, for example by certification of

    of BMO on the strength of fraudulent representations made by the fraudster.
    Shortly after the “sale” closed, the “vendor” received the proceeds from his
    solicitor and immediately purchased a bank draft from a CIBC branch in the
    amount of $450,000 CAD. The remitter of the draft was William Yawylak - the
    imposter, not the real owner of the property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Benguigui, who had had prior dealings with at least one
    if not both of the principals in the sham sale of Yawylak property, in another
    similar fraudulent scheme, took the draft to Friedberg.  Since Benguigui was not the remitter of the
    draft, Friedberg required authority from the remitter, the fake Yawylak, that
    Benguigui was in lawful possession of the draft.  Benguigui contacted the fake Yawylak who
    confirmed the legitimacy of Benguigui’s possession.  Friedberg confirmed with drawee bank that the
    draft was genuine, then accepted it and deposited it into Friedberg’s account.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In accordance with Benguigui’s instructions, Friedberg
    drew three cheques on its USD account at BMO to represent the USD equivalent of
    the funds deposited by bank draft, less any exigible commissions. Not one
    cheque, but three.  Not payable to
    Benguigui, rather at his direction, to “S. Asis”, which is said to be the name

    holder in due course of bills of exchange and entitled to payment under the <i>BEA</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge appears to have rested her decision on
    the ground that, absent fraud by Esses in obtaining the certification, BMO
    could not refuse to honour the cheques it had certified.  BMO adduced no evidence that Esses was a
    participant in the fraud, thus Esses, as “
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    S. Asis”,
    was entitled to payment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Critical to the decision of the motion judge is her
    determination that there was <i>no</i> evidence of Esses’ participation in any fraud, thus <i>no </i>triable issue raised in BMO’s defence to Esses’ claim however
    advanced.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>            The Disqualifying Factors</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties agree that certification of the cheque is
    equivalent to acceptance under the <i>BEA</i>.  It is of no legal moment whether the
    certification was done by mistake or in ignorance of the origin of the funds. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The payee of a cheque is a holder under s. 2 of the <i>BEA</i>.  Under s. 57(2) of the <i>Act</i>, in
    the absence of evidence to the contrary, every holder of a bill of exchange,
    including payees of certified cheques, is deemed to be a holder in due course.
    The presumption is rebuttable by evidence to the contrary. But if acceptance,
    issue or subsequent negotiation of the bill is affected with fraud or
    illegality, the burden of proof that a person is the holder in due course is on
    the party who claims the benefit of that status.  Here it is clear that the bills, the
    certified cheques, were affected with fraud or other illegality.  The presumption that their holder, Esses, was
    a holder in due course falls away.  The
    onus of proving that he is a holder in due course shifts to Esses.  BMO does not have to prove the opposite as
    the motion judge held.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To be a holder in due course under s. 55(1) of the <i>Act</i>, a person must take a bill, complete
    and regular on its face, under several conditions, including but not only:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'>i.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>in good faith;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'>ii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>for value; and</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'>iii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>without notice of any defect in the title of the person
    who negotiated it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>A title is
    defective under s. 55(2) when a person obtains the bill or acceptance of it by
    fraud, or other unlawful means, or for an illegal consideration.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, it fell to the motion judge to determine
    whether there was any genuine issue for trial in connection with any factor
    that would disentitle Esses to claim under the <i>Act</i>.  A genuine issue is an
    issue that is at once not spurious and relates to a material fact.  <i>Ungerman</i> at paras. 16 and 22.  There must not be
    an issue of fact that requires a trial for its resolution.  Said in another way, it must be clear that a
    trial is unnecessary. <i>Ungerman</i> at
    para. 22.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As it seems to me, at the core of this proceeding is
    the issue of credibility.  Of the
    ubiquitous Benguigui and the fortuitously available Esses. It is a sensible
    general proposition that, if there is an issue of credibility, a trial is
    required, and summary judgment should not be granted.  <i>Ungerman</i> at para. 24.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The central issues in this case have to do with Esses’
    knowledge of the provenance of the scheme by which the certified cheques came
    into his possession and whether Esses, in fact, gave value for the cheques.  Esses denied knowledge of and participation
    in any fraudulent scheme.  BMO says Esses
    is lying, was well aware of and complicit in the scheme, and that the bag of
    cash either did not exist or consisted of ill-gotten funds.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Knowledge, more generally state of mind, is notoriously
    difficult to establish.  For the most
    part, what is involved is the drawing of inferences from conduct, both acts and
    omissions, as well as words spoken or left unsaid.  Inferences are drawn from the evidence as a
    whole, not by segregating various items or dividing up what is, in effect, a
    continuous transaction into discrete parts shorn of context.  The existence of competing inferences
    underscores the necessity of their resolution by a trier of fact, on <i>viva voce</i> evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As in <i>Ungerman</i>,
    the timing and sequence of the several transactions, not to mention the
    plausibility of some of the responses advanced, raises genuine issues about whether
    Esses acquired the cheques for value, knew of the provenance of the funds, and
    participated in the overall scheme.  Further, Esses’ refusal to answer certain
    questions and to provide requested documentation has served to limit BMO’s
    ability to put its best foot forward in response to Esses’ motion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, I would allow the appeal with costs, set
    aside the order of the motion judge granting summary judgment to the respondent
    Esses and dismissing the appellant’s motion for leave to amend the statement of
    defence, and, in their place, make an order dismissing Esses’ motion for
    summary judgment with costs.  The
    appellant shall be at liberty to pursue its motion for leave to amend the
    statement of defence and any other motions in the appropriate forum. I would
    fix the costs of the appeal at $17,500.00 inclusive of disbursements and GST
    and award the appellant costs of the motion for summary judgment, on a partial
    indemnity basis, in the amount of $30,000.00 inclusive of GST and
    disbursements.</p>
