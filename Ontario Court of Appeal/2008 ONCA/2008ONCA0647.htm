  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted by the trial judge of
    sexual assault and failing to comply with probation.  The trial judge imposed a nine-month
    custodial sentence on the sexual assault offence and a 12-month conditional
    sentence on the fail to comply with probation offence.  The trial judge further imposed an 18-month
    probation order, as well as an order to provide a DNA sample and an order to
    comply with the <i>Sex Offender Information
    Registration Act</i>, S.C. 2004, c. 10.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals his conviction for sexual assault
    and, if leave is granted, his sentence on both offences.  On the conviction appeal, the appellant
    submits that the trial judge misapprehended crucial aspects of the evidence in
    a way that resulted in a miscarriage of justice.  For the reasons that follow, I agree with
    this submission and would allow the appeal.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>Background</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, who was 19 years old at the time of the
    offences, and the complainant, then 15 years of age, were neighbours and
    platonic friends.  The complainant
    testified that the sexual assault occurred when she spent the night at the
    appellant’s home sometime between July 15, 2004 and August 31, 2004, while his
    parents were out of town.  She testified
    that he sexually imposed himself on her in a number of ways, including
    attempted vaginal intercourse.  According
    to the complainant, the sexual assault took place on a sofa bed in the living
    room that was pulled out into the bed position.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant testified that the date of the
    complainant’s visit was August 16, 2004, while his parents were out of town on
    their honeymoon.  He testified that there
    was no sexual interaction at all.  The
    appellant also testified that the sofa bed referred to by the complainant had
    no mattress on it and that the sofa bed was not pulled out on that or any other
    night.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The two-day trial was completed in late November 2005.  Final submissions were made by the Crown and
    defence on January 11, 2006 and the trial judge delivered oral reasons the same
    day.  The trial judge applied a proper <i>W.D.</i> analysis:  <i>R. v.
    W.D.</i> (1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 397 (S.C.C.).  He disbelieved the appellant’s testimony and
    found that his testimony did not raise a reasonable doubt.  He believed the complainant and concluded that
    her testimony, despite its inconsistencies, established the appellant’s guilt
    beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his factum the appellant submitted that the trial
    judge misapprehended the evidence in several material ways. I discuss only the
    following two alleged misapprehensions, which were pressed in oral submissions:
     </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i) The trial judge was mistaken in his
    understanding that the appellant testified that he slept on the sofa bed in the
    bed position, when he specifically testified that he slept on it in the couch
    position.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii) The trial judge
    erroneously found that the appellant forgot his parents’ honeymoon. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant contends that these misapprehensions
    caused the trial judge to base his conclusions regarding the credibility of the
    witnesses on an erroneous understanding of the evidence.  I deal with both of the alleged
    misapprehensions and then discuss why I am of the view that a new trial should
    be ordered.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></h4>
  <p class=Subheading><b><span
style='font-style:normal;'>Did the trial judge
    misapprehend the evidence?</span></b></p>
  <p class=Subheading>(i) Evidence on the position of
    the sofa bed</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant testified that the sexual assault took
    place in the appellant’s living room on a sofa bed, which was pulled out.  She said that the sofa bed had sheets and a
    mattress on it and the frame was intact. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant and his mother testified that the sofa
    bed had no mattress and that it could not be used in the bed position and never
    was.  In cross-examination, the appellant
    indicated that on the night in question, he slept on the “couch/bed” in the
    couch position. The testimony was as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        It
    was a couch/bed and you slept on the couch/bed?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        Yes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        Okay.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        In
    the couch position.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s mother said the following when
    describing the sofa bed in the bed position:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>You couldn’t lie on it.
    There is no way you could lay on it…It had springs and bars going across it and
    I think if you tried to lay on it the springs would separate because they were
    lengthwise and you would fall between them onto the floor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the course of the trial judge’s analysis of the credibility
    of the defence evidence, he remarked that, although the appellant’s mother was
    emphatic that the sofa bed could not be used as a bed because one would fall
    through the springs, the accused had testified that he had slept on it:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Some issues that I have, some observations that I
    make about [the evidence of the appellant’s mother] include the following; she
    was very emphatic that the sofa was never used as a bed, too uncomfortable, you
    could fall through it, yet interestingly the accused said he slept on it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that his testimony that he slept
    on the sofa bed in the couch position should not have been used to undermine his
    mother’s testimony that the sofa had no mattress and could not be used as a
    bed.  The appellant argues that this
    misapprehension was crucial because the lack of a mattress on the sofa bed was
    the only piece of independently verifiable evidence that the defence could
    point to in order to contradict the complainant’s allegations. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent contends that the trial judge noted earlier
    in his reasons that the appellant said “that the couch in question was never
    pulled out because it had no mattress, just bars and the springs.”  The trial judge also noted that the appellant’s
    evidence in chief was “that he slept on the couch”.  The passages relied on by the respondent are
    from the trial judge<span lang=EN-US>’</span>s
    overall summary of the appellant’s testimony preceding his credibility
    analysis. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent submits that in the impugned passage
    from the trial judge’s reasons, he was not referring to the position the sofa bed
    was in.  Rather, the trial judge was
    referring to the inconsistency between the appellant’s testimony that he slept
    on it and his mother’s testimony that one could not lie on it. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have difficulty understanding the respondent’s
    submission.  The mother’s testimony
    related to the sofa bed in the bed position.  The trial judge specifically drew a connection between the mother’s
    testimony that one would fall through the bedsprings and the appellant’s
    testimony that he said he slept on the sofa bed as a reason for rejecting her
    testimony.  These two pieces of evidence
    can only be connected in the way the trial judge connected them if the
    appellant had testified that he slept on the sofa bed in the bed position.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have taken note that the trial judge delivered his
    reasons orally shortly after the close of submissions.  Certainly, this court should recognize the
    workload of trial judges and should not expect oral reasons to be carefully
    crafted.  Nevertheless, the substance of
    oral reasons does indicate the judge’s chain of reasoning in reaching the
    decision.  The judge’s comment that the
    appellant slept on the sofa bed is a matter of substance, not mere structure or
    form.  In my view, while the trial judge
    correctly recounted the appellant’s testimony during his general review of his
    evidence, he seems not to have kept in mind precisely what the appellant said
    when he later analysed the mother’s credibility. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am satisfied that the trial judge’s reasoning was
    affected by a misapprehension of the evidence.  </p>
  <p class=Subheading>(ii) Evidence on the honeymoon
    of the appellant’s parents</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In assessing the reliability of the appellant’s
    evidence, the trial judge observed that it was “odd that he would forget such
    an important event as his parents’ honeymoon”.  I pause to note that, like the trial judge, I refer to the appellant’s
    parents’ “honeymoon”, even though the appellant sometimes referred to the event
    as their “anniversary”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether a “honeymoon” or an “anniversary”, the
    appellant’s testimony does not disclose a basis for concluding that he forgot
    the event.  The appellant testified as
    follows in his examination in chief:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        How is it that you recall that date [of
    the night the complainant spent the night at his house], Mr. McNeil?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        ‘Cause that’s the date that all these
    allegations take place on.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        Was there any significant event in your
    life or your family’s life around that time that would cause you to recall this
    date?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        Not until I got charged.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        Let us talk about August the 16th, 2004
    then. Did you see [J.C.] that day?  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        Yes sir.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>                                                ...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        And do you recall where you first saw
    [J.C.] that day? </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        At her house. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        How had you come to be there?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        My parents left to go up to the trailer
    for their honeymoon.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The most that can be said is that the appellant did not
    refer to the honeymoon when it was apparent to the trial judge that examining
    counsel was seeking an explanation of how the appellant could identify the
    exact date of the complainant’s visit to his home.  However, the appellant’s initial answers simply
    reflected that this date was significant to him because of the events leading
    to the allegations for which he was being tried for sexual assault.  The date of these events was not his parents’
    wedding date, as they were married three or four days earlier.  After he was charged, he was able to identify
    the date when the alleged assault occurred because his parents had been away on
    their honeymoon on the night the complainant stayed over at his house. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s answers were responsive to the
    questions that were posed and provide no basis for inferring that he forgot his
    parents’ honeymoon.  The trial judge
    specifically used this finding to diminish the reliability of his evidence.  In my view, the trial judge’s conclusion was
    based upon a misapprehension of the evidence. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The effect of the trial judge’s
    misapprehension of the evidence </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On a conviction appeal where misapprehension of the
    evidence is alleged, it is not enough that the appellant demonstrate that the
    trial judge misapprehended portions of the evidence.  The appellant bears the additional burden of
    showing that the misapprehension affected the reasonableness of the verdict, or
    occasioned a miscarriage of justice, or amounted to an error in law.  As Doherty J.A. in <i>R. v. Morrissey</i> (1995), 97 C.C.C. (3d) 193 at paragraph 88 (Ont.
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    )
    explained: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my opinion, on appeals
    from convictions in indictable proceedings where misapprehension of the
    evidence is alleged, this court should first consider the reasonableness of the
    verdict (s. 686(1)(a)(i)).  If the
    appellant succeeds on this ground an acquittal will be entered.  If the verdict is not unreasonable, then the
    court should determine whether the misapprehension of evidence occasioned a
    miscarriage of justice (s. 686(1)(a)(iii)).  If the appellant is able to show that the error resulted in a
    miscarriage of justice, then the conviction must be quashed and, in most cases,
    a new trial ordered.  Finally, if the
    appellant cannot show that the verdict was unreasonable or that the error
    produced a miscarriage of justice, the court must consider the vexing question
    of whether the misapprehension of the evidence amounted to an error in law (s.
    686(1)(a)(ii)).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant did not attempt to argue that the
    misapprehension of the evidence rendered the verdict unreasonable.  The trial judge identified a number of other
    reasons for disbelieving the appellant’s testimony and for why it did not raise
    a reasonable doubt in his mind.  The
    verdict cannot be said to be unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would, however, find that the trial judge’s misapprehension
    of the evidence occasioned a miscarriage of justice in this case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The foundation of the defence at trial was that the
    testimony about the sofa bed undermined the complainant’s credibility.  The defence’s position was that the
    complainant could not be believed that a sexual assault took place on the sofa
    bed because the sofa bed did not have a mattress and could not be used in the
    bed position. Besides relying on the appellant’s and his mother’s testimony
    about the sofa bed, defence counsel at trial stressed the inconsistencies in
    the complainant’s testimony related to the position of the sofa bed.  He pointed out that in her video statement to
    police, which she adopted as her testimony in chief, the complainant initially
    said that when she and the appellant entered his home that evening, the sofa
    bed was already pulled out and she did not know why.  Later on in the same video statement, she
    said that they pulled out the sofa bed together to watch movies on and
    described the furniture they had to move to make room for it.  Defence counsel contrasted her inconsistency
    about the sofa bed with the appellant’s and his mother’s testimony that the
    sofa bed had no mattress.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Defence counsel at trial went on to argue that on the
    complainant's own version of the events, any sexual activity that took place
    ended when the complainant told the appellant to stop as he was attempting to
    penetrate her.  Her lack of consent to
    the sexual activity was not credible as she did not attempt to get off the sofa
    bed or attempt to close her legs when the appellant subjected her to prolonged
    oral sex.  Defence counsel submitted her
    explanation for her lack of action at earlier stages fell “short of what common
    sense would expect of such a situation”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s misapprehension that the appellant
    forgot his parents’ honeymoon does not seem important when considered in
    isolation.  However, the trial judge specifically
    indicated he relied on this as another reason for finding the appellant’s
    testimony unreliable.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having employed these misapprehensions to diminish the
    credibility of the defence evidence, the trial judge concluded that defence
    evidence was inadequate to raise a reasonable doubt and the complainant’s
    testimony was sufficiently credible to establish beyond a reasonable doubt there
    was sexual activity to which she did not consent. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Morrissey</i> Doherty
    J.A. indicated at paragraph 96 that the appellant met the onus of showing a
    miscarriage of justice by demonstrating that there were “significant errors in
    the trial judge's understanding of the substance of the evidence” which “figured
    prominently in the reasoning process which led to crucial findings of
    credibility and reliability, and then to crucial findings of fact”.  In <i>R.
    v. Beaulieu,</i> [2004] O.J. No. 4107, there was, apart from the misapprehended
    evidence, ample evidence to support rejection of the appellant's testimony and
    to sustain the conviction. Still, this court found there had been a miscarriage
    of justice because the conviction resulted from the trial judge’s disbelief of
    the appellant and the misapprehended evidence was “an essential part of the
    reasoning process he used” (at paragraph 7).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case I am satisfied that the trial judge’s misapprehension
    of the evidence  figured prominently in the
    trial judge’s reasoning process leading to a conviction and thus led to a miscarriage
    of justice. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would allow the appeal and order a new trial.</p>
