    appeals from the trial judgment the declaration that the respondents Robert
    Innes Elliott and Patricia Lee Elliott are the lawful owners of certain real
    property registered in the name of the Society. The Elliotts’ claim was based
    on adverse possession. The Society brought a counter application for a declaration
    that the Elliotts are trespassing on its lands and have no claim by adverse
    possession or otherwise. </span></p>
  <h3>Facts</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Society has owned and
    operated the Woodstock Fairground since 1831. The grounds encompass a
    racetrack, horse barns, rental halls, an arena and various other buildings
    associated with the operation of a fairground. The lands in dispute, designated
    as Part 1 and 2 on Plan 41R-7864 (the Disputed Lands), lie to the north of the Society’s
    racetrack and to the west of its poultry barn. The Society had installed a high
    wood and aluminum privacy fence along the northern boundary of the racetrack
    and the southern boundary of the Disputed Lands. The Society had also erected other
    fencing along most of the other boundaries of the Disputed Lands. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On November 15, 1982, Janet
    Sinclair purchased lands consisting of lot 12, Plan 41M-75 with the intention
    of building a home on it. Their land adjoined the Disputed Lands on its western
    boundary. Both Ms. Sinclair and her husband were aware at the time that the Disputed
    Lands were owned by the Woodstock Agricultural Society. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Sinclairs viewed the Disputed
    Lands as “abandoned property” and worked to improve the lands by cleaning up
    dead trees, planting grass and installing a sprinkler system, with the
    objective of possessing the lands for their own use. The Sinclairs did nothing
    to hide their intention to possess the lands. By 1987 they completed
    installation of a wooden fence with a locked gate at the northwest corner of
    the Disputed Lands. The installation of this fence and gate had the result that
    the Disputed Lands were completely fenced in and access to them could be
    obtained only by entering through the locked gate or through the Sinclair home.
    The Sinclairs kept the gate locked at almost all times. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The Sinclairs sold
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    Lot 12 to the Elliots on June 3, 1999. At the time of the
    purchase, the Sinclairs advised the Elliotts of their claim for adverse
    possession of the Disputed Lands. It does not seem, however, that a description
    of the Disputed Lands was included in the Sinclairs’ deed to the Elliotts. The
    Elliots in turn continued to work on and improve the Disputed Lands, which
    continued to be totally enclosed by fences. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In 2003, surveyors advised the Society
    that the Disputed Lands could potentially be taken over by “squatters’ rights”.
    This led to the Society writing to the Eliotts on July 18, 2003, asserting
    ownership of the Disputed Lands. Mrs. Elliott’s reply dated August 7, 2003
    stated that “... the lot in question has been enclosed with
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    850 Berkshire Drive, and has been
    maintained by the owners of said address for 23 years. The piece of property in
    question is landlocked without access to a road, therefore unable to be
    developed.” Mrs. Elliott made an offer to purchase the property for $1500 and
    to pay “all costs to make this transaction possible.”</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On September 25, 2003, the Society
    again wrote to Elliotts requesting them to produce documentation showing proof
    of ownership of the Disputed Lands. The Elliotts’ lawyer replied by letter dated
    October 3, 2003 stating that the Elliotts had possessory title to the Disputed
    Lands. Their lawyer suggested that the offer made by the Elliots to purchase
    the land was reasonable and confirmed that it was still open for acceptance.
    This offer was not accepted by the Society.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

    that the foundation for the claim is statutory, resting upon ss. 4 and 15 of
    the <i>Real Property Limitations Act</i> R.S.O. 1990, c. L15, as amended.  </span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:
14.0pt;'>A person claiming a possessory title must
    establish the following matters: </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a)       actual possession for the statutory
    period of 10 years by himself or herself and those through whom he or she
    claims; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b)       such possession was with
    the intention of excluding from possession the owner or persons entitled to
    possession; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(c)       discontinuance of possession for the
    statutory period by the owner and all others, if any, entitled to possession<b>.</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The application judge made
    clear findings of fact and summarized them in a convenient list:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a)       Although Mr. and Mrs. Sinclair did not surround
    the Disputed Lands with fencing, most of which was already in place when they
    purchased the property in November 1982, by installing the wooden fence and
    gate at the northwest corner of the Disputed Lands, they effectively enclosed
    them.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b)       By 1987, they had made improvements to
    Part 1 [of the Disputed Lands] of such a nature that it would appear to any
    observer to be part of their rear yard and they used it as such.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(c)       By 1988, they had cleaned up Part 2 [of
    the Disputed Lands] and made use of it in a variety of ways....</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(d)       During all of this time and until they
    sold the property, they intended to exclude the true owners, knowing that they
    were in effect trespassing on the Society’s lands.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(e)       There is absolutely no evidence that the Society
    in any way entered upon or used the Disputed Lands during the time Mrs.
    Sinclair owned
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Lot 12 and made use of Parts 1
    and 2, notwithstanding the fact that Mr. and Mrs. Sinclair did nothing to hide
    what they were doing.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(f)        After they purchased the property in
    June 1999, Mr. and Mrs. Elliott continued to use Part 1 as part of their rear
    yard and made some further improvements to it. They also made use of Part 2…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(g)       Mr. and Mrs. Elliott were also aware that
    the Society was the registered owner of the Disputed Lands and took care “not
    to allow any person representing the Woodstock Fair Board to enter Parts 1 and
    2.”</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(h)       During the entire period that Mrs.
    Sinclair and Mr. and Mrs. Elliott owned
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Lot
    12, up to July 2003 when Mr. Wilson wrote to them, the Society failed to take
    any steps whatsoever to assert its rights to the Disputed Lands.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i)        During this same period, there is no
    evidence that the Society ever inspected or viewed the Disputed Lands.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(j)        Although
    the fence along the southerly border of the Disputed Lands would prevent a
    representative of the Society from viewing them from the main lands owned by
    the Society located to the south, this was not the only point from which the Disputed
    Lands could be viewed. In fact, Mr. Burill admitted he had seen the board fence
    at the northwest corner of the Disputed Lands “many times.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The application judge accepted
    the Elliots’ submission that the statutory period had already expired when they
    offered, in 2003, to buy the property. Therefore the offer did not constitute
    an acknowledgment of the Society’s title or compromise their claim to
    possessory title.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The application judge rejected
    the Society’s argument that the Sinclairs’ and the Elliotts’ possession of Disputed
    Lands was not “open” because the Disputed Lands were not visible from the Society’s
    property due to the high fence along the southerly border of the disputed
    property. He reasoned that the Society “ought not to be able to hide behind the
    fence it erected along the southern boundary of the property so as to claim
    that the obvious and unhidden uses made of the property by [the Sinclairs and
    the Elliotts] were not ‘open’”. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The application judge appreciated that the second and third criteria of
    the test for adverse possession are not met unless the claimants establish, not
    only actual possession of the land, but also that the legal owners were in fact
    effectively excluded from its possession.  To do this, the claimants must show that their use of the lands was
    inconsistent with the use the legal owner intended to make of the lands. The
    application judge recognized that the test of inconsistent use focuses on the
    intention of the legal owners and not the intention of the claimants. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The application judge
    considered the inconsistent use test in relation to the two uses of the Disputed
    Lands that the Society claim to have. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, the Society claimed to
    be using the lands as a “buffer”. The application judge characterized the Society’s
    evidence as “rather vague” and found that the evidence fell short of
    establishing that the Society required or used the Disputed Lands as a “buffer
    zone”.  In any event, he went on to find
    that the claimants’ uses of the Disputed Lands were inconsistent with the use
    of the lands as a “buffer zone”.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second, the Society claimed it
    was holding the Disputed Lands for future development. The application judge
    found that the Society could not rely upon retaining the lands for future
    development to assist its position. He accepted the argument of counsel for the
    Eliotts that the Society’s position was untenable. Counsel had relied upon the
    observation quoted and approved by this court in <i>Masidon Investments Ltd. v. Ham</i>, [1984] O.J. No. 3139, 45 O.R. (2d)
    563 and <i>Teis v. Ancaster (Town)</i> 35
    O.R. (3d) 216, [1997] O.J. No. 3512 that “... [I]t is the use being made of the
    land during the running of the limitation period that is significant, not some
    independent future use, if one exists, that is different”. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The application judge
    recognized that as a matter of public policy courts ought generally to protect
    the interests of the true owners of property and not to assist trespassers. He
    observed that the Eliotts and their predecessors in title were trespassers who
    set out to obtain title to the Disputed Lands knowing full well that the Society
    held title to them. Nevertheless, he found that</span><span lang=EN-US
style='font-size:14.0pt;'> </span><span lang=EN-US>the Society did
    not act reasonably and with due regard to its own interests. He commented, “what
    happened here is that the Society in effect abandoned the Disputed Lands. It
    failed to post any signs on the property to dissuade trespassers. It failed to
    inspect the property at all, although it was open to it to do so quite easily.”
    In conclusion he found that:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a)       The
    Elliots and their predecessors in title had exercised “open, notorious,
    peaceful, adverse, exclusive, actual, and continuous” possession of the Disputed
    Lands from November 1989 to the time of trial;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b)       throughout, their possession had been
    with the intention of excluding the Society from possession of the Disputed
    Lands; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(c)       during
    the entire period, the Society had discontinued its possession of the Disputed
    Lands.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Accordingly, he declared that
    the Elliots were the lawful owners of Parts 1 and 2 by virtue of sections 4 and
    15 of the <i>Real Property Limitations Act </i>R.S.O. 1990, c. L.15 as amended

    issues, of which I propose to discuss only one. Many of the Society’s arguments
    sought to undermine the application judge’s findings of fact. His comment that “[t]here
    is absolutely no evidence that the Society in any way entered upon [the lands]”
    and “there is no evidence that the Society ever inspected or reviewed the Disputed
    Lands” may be overstatement. The president of the Society at the time deposed
    he went back to the area and all around the grounds. That said, the judge’s
    essential findings were amply supported by the evidence. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There is no merit in the Society’s
    submission that the application judge erred in law by concluding that the
    Elliots’ offer to purchase did not affect their right to adverse possession
    because, as he pointed out, it was made after the expiry of the statutory
    period. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Nor do I find merit in the Society’s
    contention that the application judge erred in failing to accept the evidence
    it intended to use the lands as a buffer zone. Whether the Society intended to
    use the lands as a buffer zone was a question of fact within his purview as the
    trier of fact. However, I do accept that the application judge erred in law by
    failing to properly apply the “inconsistent use” test referred to above by
    refusing to consider the Society’s intention of holding the Disputed Lands for
    future development as the current use during the statutory period. </span></p>
  <h3>The Inconsistent Use Test and Lands Held for Future Development</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The application judge held that
    the Society could not rely upon retaining the Disputed Lands for future
    development to assist its position.  As
    noted above, he relied on the proposition that it is the intended use of the
    land during the running of the limitation period that is significant, not some
    independent future use. A review of the two cases cited in the application judge’s
    decision, </span><i><span lang=EN-US>Masidon Investments Ltd. v. Ham</span></i><span
lang=EN style='color:black;'> (1984), 45 O.R. (2d) 563 (C.A.)</span><span lang=EN-US> and <i>Teis v. Ancaster (Town of)</i><span
style='color:black'> <span class=canliicitation>35 O.R. (3d) 216 (C.A.)</span></span>,</span><span
lang=EN-US> makes clear that the Society could indeed rely on holding the lands
    for future development. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In<i> Masidon </i>the claimant operated an airport consisting of two grass
    runways on the disputed property. Their construction required extensive
    ditching, grading and the addition of dozens of large truckloads of fill. The
    claimant maintained the runways. He also constructed a small building used as a
    hangar and parking lots for airplanes and automobiles. The claimant and his
    family used the balance of the property for recreational and other purposes. He
    built a dam and driveway capable of supporting heavy trucks. He deposited fill
    elsewhere on the land, installed some fencing for horses and used wood from the
    land. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Nevertheless, this court upheld
    the decision of the trial judge that the use made of the Disputed Lands by the claimant
    was not inconsistent with the legal owner’s purpose of holding them for future sale.
    In reaching that conclusion, the court observed at paragraph 26: </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In this case Carruthers J.
    had to decide whether he should take into account not only the respondents’ use
    of the property as owners during the period of Ham’s possession but also any
    future use. This could be a question of significance where land is held for
    development and where, conceivably, acts of the trespasser which did not
    interfere with the owner’s use while the land lay idle might none the less
    interfere with its future development. He held at p. 547 that “it is the use
    being made of the land during the running of the limitation period that is
    significant, not some intended future use, if one exists, that is different”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In understanding this passage,
    it is important to remember that the result of the case is premised on the
    recognition that holding lands for future development is a current use. What
    this means is that it does not matter that the claimant’s use of the lands may
    be inconsistent with the future development that might eventually take place;
    the claimant’s use of the land must be inconsistent with the legal owner’s use
    during the running of the limitation period. Simply put – the holding of lands
    for future development qualifies as a current use during the running of the
    limitation period. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Thus, Blair J.A. found that “Carruthers
    J. was right in limiting his consideration to the use made by the owner during
    the period of the trespasser’s possession and excluding any consideration of
    future use.” He went on to comment on the confusion that was possible at
    paragraph 29:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The source of confusion of use during the trespass
    with future use is easily explained. Where, as here, the owner makes no active
    use of the land at all, his user can best be described not in terms of things
    actually done on the land but rather in terms of the purpose for which he holds
    it. In many of the cases and in some of the extracts from judgments quoted
    above the purpose of holding land is described as its “intended use”. The words
    “intended use” in these cases leads to confusion with future use as opposed to
    actual use during the limitation period. The difficulty is not one of legal
    doctrine but rather one of expression. In my opinion, it would be more
    appropriate in these cases to speak always of the use which the owner made or
    intended to make of the land in dispute when the trespasser occupied it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The result, Blair J.A. observed,
    has been stated in <i>A Manual of the Law of
    Real Property</i>, 4th ed. (1969), edited by P. V. Baker, at p. 529:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If the owner has little present use for
    the land, much may be done on it by others without demonstrating a possession
    inconsistent with the owner’s title ...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It may be wondered why
    the more limited the use made of land by its owner, the greater is the apparent
    protection from claims for possessory title. The reason is plain. Whether
    possession is adverse depends in every case on the circumstances and
    particularly on the use being made of the land by the owner. As Ormrod L.J.
    said in the Wallis case, supra, at p. 590:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The same act or acts of trespass may be highly
    significant to the owner of a house and garden, yet utterly trivial to a
    property developer or an industrialist who has no immediate use for the land
    affected.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-US>Blair J.A. added there is good sense in Baker’s conclusion on the
    same page that:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This seems reasonable since
    the interests of justice are not served by encouraging litigation to restrain
    harmless activities merely to preserve legal rights, the enjoyment of which is,
    for good reason, being deferred.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Blair J.A. approved of the
    comment of the trial judge in <i>Masidon </i>that
    it may very well be the case that this means that possessory title virtually cannot
    be obtained against “development land” which is in the holding stage. Blair J.A.
    added at paragraph 33:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This result, however, is not surprising
    because there is no policy reason for concern about the rights of the appellant
    in this case or, indeed, any trespasser seeking to acquire possessory title to
    land held for development. The appellant deliberately embarked on a course of
    conduct which ultimately led to an intention to dispossess the respondents of
    their property. In my opinion, Justice Carruthers was correct in concluding
    that the purpose of the Limitations Act was not “to promote the obtaining of
    possessory title” by a person in the position of the appellant. The policy
    underlying the Limitations Act was stated by Burton J.A. in <i>Harris v. Mudie</i> (1882), 7 O.A.R. 414, as
    follows at p. 421:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The rule, as I understand it, has always been to
    construe the Statutes of Limitations in the very strictest manner where it is
    shewn that the person invoking their aid is a mere trespasser ... and such a
    construction commends itself to one’s sense of right. They were never in fact
    intended as a means of acquiring title, or as an encouragement to dishonest
    people to enter on the land of others with a view to deprive them of it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In <i>Teis </i>this court found that the test of inconsistent use does not
    apply in a case of mutual mistake about title. Laskin J.A. observed that the
    test of inconsistent use furthered the policy of strengthening the hand of the
    legal owner in the face of an adverse possession claim by a knowing trespasser.
    Laskin J.A. noted, however that that there was little purpose in applying it to
    claims by persons who honestly, though mistakenly, use land that is not their
    own. <i>Teis</i>, of course, has no
    application to this case.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The respondents` factum
    included an alternative argument that the “inconsistent use test” ought to be
    discarded altogether. However, counsel did not press the argument in oral
    submissions. As the argument was not a live issue in the appeal, I would not request
    the Chief Justice to order the appeal be reheard by a five judge panel to
    consider it.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US> In conclusion, I would allow the appeal
    because the application judge erred in concluding that the Society could not
    rely on its position that it was holding the lands for future development as a
    current use during the statutory period. There was some evidence to support
    that position and I note that the Society sold off the lands purchased by the
    Sinclairs.  I would set aside the judgment
    of the application judge and the declaration he issued and substitute the
    declaration the Society sought in its application namely, that the respondents
    are trespassing on the lands, that the respondents do not have a claim to the
    lands by virtue of adverse possession, and that the Society may remove the
    possessions of the respondents on the lands at the cost of the respondents. </span></p>

    costs on the appeal on a partial indemnity scale in the amount of $15,000
    including disbursements and G.S.T., and award it the costs of the application
