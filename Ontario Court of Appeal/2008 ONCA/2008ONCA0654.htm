  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants are serving life sentences for
    murder.  They have been classified as
    minimum security prisoners and are currently incarcerated at Isabel McNeill
    House (IMH) in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Kingston,
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario.  IMH is a very old building, which was originally designed as a residence
    and was at one time the home of the deputy warden of Kingston
    Penitentiary.  It has been used as a minimum
    security facility for women incarcerated in the federal penitentiary system for
    many years.  It has a ten person
    capacity.  At the time these proceedings
    were commenced there were four prisoners residing at IMH.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because of its age IMH is in need of a thorough and
    expensive retrofit.  The Correctional Services
    of Canada (CSC) has decided to close that institution permanently and move the
    applicants to Grand Valley Institution (GVI) in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Kitchener,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario.  GVI is a multi-level federal penitentiary for
    women.  It contains housing for minimum
    security prisoners, and separate housing for medium as well as maximum security
    prisoners.  All of the housing is within
    the same institution and the prisoners share common administrative and
    recreational facilities.  CSC plans to
    transfer the applicants to the minimum security residences within GVI.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicants moved for h<i>abeas corpus</i> claiming that the transfer resulted in a deprivation
    of their residual liberty interest and was unlawful because it was contrary to
    the relevant legislation and offended various provisions of the<i> Charter.</i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application was heard over four days by Scott
    J.  He determined that the applicants had
    not established that the transfer would deprive them of any residual liberty interest.  He also held that the transfer was not in any
    event unlawful.  The appellants appeal
    from that decision.  They remain at IMH
    and CSC remains determined to close that facility.  Of the four original applicants one has since
    transferred to another institution and, as we understand it, is no longer
    involved in these proceedings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The record before Scott J. was massive.  The summary provided by him in his reasons and
    in particular in an appendix he attached to those reasons highlights the
    differences and similarities between the two institutions.  We rely on his summary of the relevant facts.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An applicant who is lawfully in custody and who is
    seeking relief by way of <i>habeas corpus</i> from an order transferring that applicant to another institution must
    demonstrate that the transfer would amount to a substantial change in the applicant’s
    conditions of incarceration, thereby resulting in a deprivation of a residual
    liberty interest.  If the appellant
    succeeds in showing that deprivation the onus moves to the jailer to
    demonstrate that the transfer is lawful.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel on appeal acknowledges, correctly in our view, that
    if she cannot demonstrate that the transfer would result in a deprivation of
    the applicants’ liberty interest the entire application must fail.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge dealt with the argument that the
    transfer resulted in the deprivation of the liberty interest.  We are in substantial agreement with his
    analysis of the issue (see paragraphs 43-47).  We agree with his observation at paragraph 45:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Given the evidence before me, the transfer from IMH
    to GVI does not constitute a deprivation of their liberty on probable and
    reasonable grounds.  There are
    differences between the facilities but these differences are minimal and do not
    constitute a marked departure from the guidelines which are to be followed by
    CSC in the treatment and housing of like female prisoners.  In fact, were there a facility of the same
    design and function as GVI located in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Kingston,
    there would be no real basis for this <i>habeas
    corpus</i> Application.  As such, it
    follows that although the Applicants are being laterally transferred, the
    geographical change from
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Kingston to
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Kitchener is not
    significant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In her able submissions, counsel for the applicants
    submitted that the transfer of the applicants to GVI would result in a
    deprivation of the applicants’ residual liberty interest for three
    reasons.  First she argued that the added
    perimeter security at GVI exacerbated the applicant’s sense of confinement and
    thereby created at least an added psychological deprivation of liberty.  It is clear that there is a great deal more
    perimeter security at GVI, although, unlike IMH, there is no guard within the
    minimum security residence.  One can
    accept that the added perimeter security enhances the sense that one is in
    prison.  However, in our view, that kind
    of psychological impact does not affect any residual liberty interests in the
    relevant sense.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At both GVI and IMH prisoners are not allowed to leave
    the grounds of the institution without the requisite permission.  The added perimeter security obviously makes
    it more difficult to escape from GVI, but does not limit the residual liberty
    of the prisoners in any way.  In both
    institutions they are obliged to remain within the perimeter absent permission
    to go beyond the perimeter.  The added
    security at GVI, no doubt brought about because GVI houses medium and maximum
    security prisoners as well as minimum security prisoners, does not mean that
    the minimum security prisoners are any more, or any less, confined than they
    were at IMH.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel’s second argument is based on the alleged
    restrictions in the movements within the institution allowed to minimum
    security prisoners at GVI compared to that available to prisoners at IMH.  Counsel submits that there are substantial
    restrictions at GVI that have no equivalent at IMH.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are restrictions on the movements of minimum
    security prisoners at GVI that do not exist at IMH.  These restrictions are explained by the very
    different physical structures of the two institutions.  IMH is a relatively small residence and
    consists of a single building.  GVI is a
    large institution housing women of different security classifications and
    consists of several different residences and other administrative buildings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The record indicates that there are some minor
    limitations imposed on the movement of minimum security prisoners at GVI because
    of the mixed nature of the prison population. For example, minimum security
    prisoners must have a pass to move from one building to another, although they
    can move within their own residence without any such pass.  There is nothing in the record to suggest
    that passes are difficult to get or that movement around the institution for
    minimum security prisoners is in any way compromised by the pass
    requirement.  Minimum security prisoners
    are also not allowed in common areas when maximum security prisoners are using
    those areas.  Again there is no
    suggestion that this limitation is of any significance in the day to day lives
    of minimum security prisoners at GVI.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicant’s argument essentially comes down to the
    contention that housing different levels of prisoners within the same
    institution in and of itself results in a deprivation of the liberty interest
    of minimum security prisoners.  We cannot
    accept that general proposition.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition to arguing that there were physical
    limitations on the movement of minimum security prisoners within GVI, two of
    the applicants suggested that their movements would be restricted because of
    subjective safety concerns they have were they to be placed in common areas
    with medium security prisoners.  These
    subjective concerns cannot in and of themselves rise to the level of
    establishing a liberty deprivation sufficient to invoke <i>habeas corpus</i> relief.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The third argument advanced by counsel relates to
    access to the escorted temporary absence program (ETP).  She submits that access to that program will
    be more restricted at GVI than it is at IMH.  The record indicates that some of the reasons for granting ETPs at IMH
    will not be applicable to ETP requests at GVI.  For example there are grocery facilities and a library on site at
    GVI.  Consequently prisoners at GVI may
    not get ETPs to go to the library or the grocery store as they do at IMH.  We do not agree that the inability to get an
    ETP for these purposes because the facilities exist within the institution is a
    denial of a liberty interest.  To the
    contrary it suggests that the institution is better able to meet the day to day
    needs of the inmates.  The criteria
    applicable to the granting of ETPs is the same at both institutions.  The institution in which a prisoner is
    located and the facilities available at that institution may have some impact
    on whether an ETP is granted in a specific situation.  Sometimes the circumstances within a
    particular institution will favour granting the requested ETP while in others
    the conditions may lead to a determination that the ETP should not be
    granted.  Regardless of the outcome of a
    particular request for an ETP, the process by which the availability of the ETP
    is determined is the same in both institutions.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view there is no deprivation of any liberty
    interest flowing from the proposed transfers of the applicants.  It follows that the applications for <i>habeas corpus </i>must fail.  The appeals are dismissed.</p>
