    legislature of Ontario in 2000 to level the legal playing field between franchisees
    and franchisors by protecting franchisees when they enter into franchise
    agreements. The Act provides a drastic remedy against franchisors who do not
    provide prior disclosure, in the required disclosure document, of all the relevant
    information that franchisees may need before deciding whether to enter into a
    franchise arrangement and to sign the franchise agreement.</p>

    corporate appellant franchisor, MDG Computers Canada, (“MDG Canada”) is a
    manufacturer, reseller and retailer of computers and televisions with 29 retail
    franchise stores in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    .
    The corporate respondent franchisee, MDG Kingston, (“MDG Kingston”) was a
    franchisee of MDG Canada. The relationship lasted seven years under two
    franchise agreements. The first was entered into on February 17, 2000, and
    lasted for five years. The second was entered into on February 17, 2005.
    However, relying on s. 6(2) of the <i>Arthur
    Wishart Act</i>, the respondent franchisee rescinded the second agreement on
    February 16, 2007, within two years of signing it, because the franchisor did not
    deliver a disclosure document required under s. 5 of the <i>Arthur Wishart Act</i>. The franchisee claimed rescission of the second
    agreement, as well as damages in respect of both agreements.</span></p>

    receipt of the statement of claim for rescission and damages, and after correspondence
    between lawyers, the appellants moved for a stay of the action based on the
    arbitration clauses contained in both agreements. The respondents brought a
    cross-motion for summary judgment for rescission of the second agreement. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    franchisor’s claim is that it was not required to deliver the statutorily
    mandated disclosure document in this case because it was entitled to a
    statutory exemption under s.&nbsp;5(7)(f) of the <i>Arthur Wishart Act</i>, on the basis that the second agreement was a
    renewal of a franchise and there were no material changes from the first
    agreement. The franchisee said that the exemption did not apply because there
    were material changes between the first and second agreements. The franchisor also
    took the tactical position not to incur the cost of making an evidentiary
    response to the summary judgment cross-motion until the court had determined
    whether there would be a stay and a referral to arbitration.</span></p>

    motion judge, however, was prepared to proceed with the summary judgment motion
    on the record before her. She compared the two franchise agreements on their
    face, and concluded that there were material changes between the two agreements
    that met the definition of “material change” in the <i>Arthur Wishart Act</i>. On that basis, she found that the franchisor
    was not entitled to an exemption from providing the disclosure document before
    entering into the second the franchise agreement, and that the franchisee was therefore
    entitled to rescind the second franchise agreement. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    motion judge also held that the franchisor was not entitled to rely on or
    enforce the arbitration clause in the second agreement because the regulations
    to the <i>Arthur Wishart Act</i> require
    that any alternative dispute resolution mechanism contained in a franchise
    agreement must be described in detail in the disclosure document. As there was
    no disclosure document, the motion judge concluded that the franchisor could
    not rely on the arbitration clause in the franchise agreement.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    motion judge consequently dismissed the franchisor’s motion for a stay of the
    action and granted the franchisee summary judgment for rescission of the second
    agreement. In its notice of motion, the franchisee had only requested summary
    judgment for rescission, but requested a trial of the issue of damages arising from
    the rescission. The trial judge made that order. The franchisee’s motion did
    not ask for any relief regarding its claim for damages under the first
    agreement, which agreement also contains an arbitration clause. Therefore, that
    part of the claim has yet to be addressed.</span></p>

    remains effective when the agreement that contains the clause is terminated or
    rescinded, or whether that clause terminates or becomes inoperative with the
    rest of the agreement. The issue is further complicated in this case because the
    arbitration clause arises in the context of a franchise agreement that is
    governed by legislation that was enacted to protect franchisees and which contains
    detailed provisions that govern the relationship between franchisors and
    franchisees in Ontario.</span></p>

    starting point for the analysis of the effectiveness of the arbitration clause in
    this context is s. 2(1)(a) of the <i>Arbitration

    arbitration under an arbitration agreement unless “the application of this Act

    terms of the agreement, as interpreted by the court. If so, then under s. 7(1),
    the court is required to stay the action and refer the claims to arbitration
    subject to the limited exceptions in s. 7(2): <i>T1T2 Limited Partnership v. Canada</i> (1994), 23 O.R. (3d) 66, 35 C.P.C.

    the <i>Arthur Wishart Act</i> and the
    regulations, as well as the <i>Arbitration

    and whether that termination has the effect of terminating the arbitration
    clause as well, the case law makes it clear that the court is not to determine
    the merits of that issue on a stay motion. Instead, the issue of whether the
    entire contract was properly terminated and the effect of any such termination is
    for the arbitrator. Otherwise, arbitration clauses would be rendered ineffective
    in many disputes, even when, in the end, they should have applied. However, in
    cases where the agreement was <i>void ab
    initio</i> because it was illegal, or where no agreement was ever reached, the
    arbitration clause will not apply because it was never validly agreed to: see
    for example, <i>Fairfield v. Low</i> (1990),
    71 O.R. (2d) 599 (H.C.J.) at paras. 20 -23, and <i>Heyman v. Darwins Ltd</i>., [1942] 1 All E.R. 337 (H.L.).</p>

    the franchise agreement was <i>void ab
    initio</i>. Therefore, it was not “invalid”. Nor does the statutory right of
    rescission make the original agreement invalid, in the sense that it was <i>void ab initio</i>. The rescission remedy is
    statutory rather than equitable, and its consequences are dictated by the
    statute, not by the common law. In <i>1490664
    <st1:State w:st="on">

    the agreement was rescinded, it was no longer in existence and could not be affirmed
    by the franchisee continuing to operate the business thereafter. Furthermore,
    where there was non-disclosure, the franchisee was no longer bound by the
    agreement and was entitled to full financial relief and compensation from the
    franchisor. However, in <i>Dig This Garden
    Retail Ltd</i>., the court was not dealing with an arbitration clause and the
    effect of rescission of the agreement on that specific clause. </p>

    Wishart Act </i>itself provides some guidance on the consequences of
    rescission. Under ss. 6(1) and (2), where there is either an incomplete
    disclosure document or no disclosure document, the franchisee may, within
    prescribed time limits, rescind the franchise agreement “without penalty or
    obligation”. If the arbitration clause is a “penalty” or “obligation” within
    the meaning of s. 6 of the <i>Arthur Wishart
    Act</i>, then after a franchisee rescinds the franchise agreement, the
    franchisee will not be bound by the arbitration clause.  In <i>Black’s
    Law Dictionary</i> (8<sup>th</sup> ed.), the word “obligation” is defined as:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(1)       A legal or moral duty to do or not do
    something.  The word has many wide and
    varied meanings. It may refer to anything that a person is bound to do or
    forbear from doing, whether the duty is imposed by law, contract, promise,
    social relations, courtesy, kindness, or morality.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(2)       A formal, binding agreement or
    acknowledgment of a liability to pay a certain amount or to do a certain thing
    for a particular person or set of persons; esp., a duty arising by contract.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(3)       Civil law. A legal relationship in which
    one person, the obligor, is bound to render a performance in favour of another,
    the obligee.  </p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left'>And a “penalty” is
    defined as:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(1)       Punishment imposed on a wrongdoer, usu.
    in the form of imprisonment or fine; esp., a sum of money exacted as punishment
    for either a wrong to the state or a civil wrong (as distinguished from
    compensation for the injured party’s loss).  Though usu. for crimes, penalties are also sometimes imposed for civil
    wrongs.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(2)       An extra charge against a party who
    violates a contractual provision.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(3)       Excessive stipulated damages that a
    contract purports to impose on a party that breaches.  If the damages are excessive enough to be
    considered a penalty, a court will usu. not enforce that particular provision
    of the contract.  Some contracts specify
    that a given sum of damages is intended “as liquidated damages and not as a
    penalty” – but even that language is not foolproof.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is clear that an arbitration agreement does not fall
    within any definition of a penalty. In my view, neither is it an obligation, as
    defined. It is an obligation in the sense that both sides to the agreement are
    required to comply with it. However, because it is wholly mutual, it is not an
    obligation in the sense of something that must be done for the other party as a
    consequence of the termination of the agreement. However, as the word “obligation”
    could arguably include a mutual obligation, in order to try to discern the
    intent of the legislature, one should consider the entire <i>Arthur Wishart Act</i> and the regulations made under it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The effect of the phrase “without penalty or

    <st1:place

    ).
    There the issue was whether a franchisor retained any rights against the
    franchisee following the franchisee’s exercise of the rescission remedy under s.
    6. The court held that the rescission of the agreement “without penalty or
    obligation” on the franchisee, did not deprive the franchisor of its right to fair
    dealing and to pursue remedies of its own under s. 9. The court again stated
    that upon rescission there is no longer a franchise agreement.  However, the court did not have to consider whether
    an arbitration clause was a penalty or obligation of the franchisee, and
    whether such a clause could survive the rescission of the balance of the
    agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is nothing in the <i>Arthur Wishart Act</i> to suggest that an arbitration clause is such a
    penalty or obligation, or that it could not survive the rescission of the
    balance of the agreement.  Nor does the
    Act limit or restrict the right of parties to a franchise agreement to agree to
    resolve any disputes by arbitration. What the Act does in s. 10 to protect
    franchisees procedurally, is it prohibits inclusion of a provision in a
    franchise agreement that restricts the application of the law of
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    Ontario or restricts jurisdiction or venue to a forum
    outside
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario.
    However, subject to the restrictions regarding law and venue in s. 10 of the
    Act, the disclosure regulation (s. 5(1)) recognizes that parties may want to
    agree to alternative dispute resolution as the method to be used to resolve
    their differences.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although in this case, no disclosure document was
    provided at all, the rescission remedy also applies where the disclosure is
    incomplete. As a result, a disclosure document that contains the required
    description of the arbitration clause in the franchise agreement can still be
    rescinded if it is incomplete in some other way. Having specifically recognized
    that franchise agreements may contain arbitration agreements for dispute
    resolution, the <i>Arthur Wishart Act</i> does not address whether rescission of a franchise agreement for inadequate
    disclosure will also rescind either a disclosed or an undisclosed arbitration clause.
    As the purpose of the <i>Arthur Wishart Act</i> is to protect franchisees, one would have expected that had the legislature
    believed that rescission of the arbitration clause was necessary for that
    protection, it would have provided that consequence specifically in s. 6, in
    addition to the reference to penalties and obligations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> An agreement to
    arbitrate is mutually applicable, and has become a common and cost-effective
    method of dispute resolution. If the arbitration clause is fairly drafted,
    there is no reason that it should be viewed as a disadvantage for the
    franchisee. In my view, it is fair to conclude, based on the <i>Arthur Wishart Act</i> and the regulations, that
    the legislature intended that the normal rules regarding arbitration clauses, including
    the arbitrator’s authority to decide its own jurisdiction as well as the
    severability of an arbitration clause under s. 17 of the <i>Arbitration Act</i>, would apply under the <i>Arthur Wishart Act</i>.</p>

line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I conclude, therefore, that the motion judge erred in
    law by failing to stay the action based on an effective finding under s. 7(2)
    of the <i>Arbitration Act</i>, that the
    arbitration clause was invalid because the franchisor did not provide
    disclosure of the details of the alternative dispute resolution agreement. The
    franchise agreement was not invalid at law; it was subject to rescission.  It was not for the court to decide the merits
    of the right to rescission in this case. The two issues of whether, on the
    merits, the franchisee was entitled to rescind the agreement, and the jurisdiction
    of the arbitrator, were for the arbitrator to determine.</p>

    determined is whether the case can be decided based on the evidence produced on
    the motion, or whether that evidence shows that there is a genuine issue that
    requires a trial. However, based on the evidence before her on the motion, the
    motion judge was not able to determine the issue of damages. She therefore
    ordered a trial of that issue, with pleadings to be exchanged and the action to
    be set down “in the normal course”. The notice of motion did not ask the court
    to address the other claim in the statement of claim for an accounting, damages
    and compensation for unjust enrichment in respect of the period from 2000 to
    2005 under the first franchise agreement, which also contained an arbitration
    clause. Therefore, along with the trial of the damages issue on the second
    agreement, the disposition of the part of the action respecting the first
    agreement has yet to be adjudicated.</p>

    7(2) of the <i>Arbitration Act</i> and the
    purpose of that section. It provides a list of five circumstances where a court
    is not required to stay an action in the face of an arbitration clause in an
    agreement. They are all cases where it would be either unfair or impractical to
    refer the matter to arbitration; unfair because there was no legal agreement to
    arbitrate or because a party effectively waived the agreement by undue delay in
    objecting to the court action, or impractical because a party was not disputing
    the claim or it was a claim that was clear and could be resolved by summary
    judgment without a referral to arbitration.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The purpose of s. 7(2) of the <i>Arbitration Act</i> is to provide a limited exception to the mandatory
    requirement that courts enforce arbitration clauses and not take jurisdiction
    where the parties have legitimately agreed to arbitrate their disputes. One of
    those exceptions arises when one party defaults and there is therefore no need
    to enlist an arbitrator to make any findings. Another is where the case is
    properly one for summary judgment, i.e. there are no genuine issues for trial,
    and therefore, as with a default situation, there are no issues that require
    the assistance of an arbitrator.</p>

    without considering whether this was a proper case for summary judgment in the
    context of s. 7(2) of the <i>Arbitration Act</i> and the stay motion brought by the franchisor. By ordering partial summary
    judgment dealing only with liability, then a full court trial of the issue of
    damages, the motion judge failed to give effect to the purpose of the exception
    for summary judgment in s. 7(2)5, which is to avoid referral to arbitration
    where further adjudication is unnecessary. </p>

    from arbitration and send it to trial in circumstances where the matter did not
    fall within s. 7(2)5 of the <i>Arbitration
    Act</i> because the whole matter was not a proper matter for summary judgment.
