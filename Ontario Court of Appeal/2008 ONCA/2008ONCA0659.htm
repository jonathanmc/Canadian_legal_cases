    to those raised in <i>Attis v.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    (Minister of Health)</i>.  The reasons in <i>Attis</i> are being released
    at the same time as the reasons in this appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN> In this case, the appellant, Kevan Drady, contends
    that he has pleaded the necessary elements to hold the respondent, Her Majesty
    the Queen in Right of Canada (Health Canada), liable in negligence for a breach
    of an alleged private law duty of care owed to recipients of silastic devices
    used in temporomandibular joints (TMJ implants).  Such implants are medical devices under the <i>Food and Drug Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-27
    (the <i>FDA </i>or the Act) and the
    regulations under that Act.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>Under rule 21.01(1)(b) of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, the motion
    judge, Cullity J., dismissed the appellant’s claim on the basis that it was
    plain and obvious that the claim disclosed no cause of action.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>II.        BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <h3>            <i>Facts</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>Since about 1968, TMJ implants
    have been sold in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  In 1981, the appellant received such an
    implant.  The appellant alleges the
    implant was unsafe and caused irreversible consequences that left him disabled
    and in pain.  Since the device implanted
    in the appellant was unlabelled, he was unable to identify its
    manufacturer.  In that circumstance, the
    appellant sued Health Canada in this proposed class proceeding under the <i>Class Proceedings Act, 1992</i>, S.O. 1992,
    c. 6 (the <i>CPA</i>).  He seeks to represent all persons resident in
    Canada who suffered damages from TMJ implants (except residents of British
    Columbia or Quebec).  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>Health Canada delivered a statement
    of defence.  It also issued a third party
    claim against the potential manufacturers of the devices, the appellant’s surgeon
    and the hospital where the appellant received his implant.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>For reasons analogous to those
    given in <i>Attis</i>, and for the reasons
    that follow, it is my view that it is plain and obvious that the appellant’s
    pleadings do not and cannot establish that Health Canada owed him a private law
    duty of care.   Accordingly, I would
    dismiss the appeal.</span></p>
  <h3><i>            Nature of the claim</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>As in <i>Attis</i>, the appellant’s pleadings consist of his statement of claim
    and his reply.  The reply effectively served
    as an amended statement of claim.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>In essence, the appellant alleges
    that Health Canada failed to properly regulate the TMJ industry as a
    whole.  He pleads that Health Canada, in
    the course of implementing a comprehensive regulatory scheme, failed to ensure the
    implants’ safety and regulatory compliance.  He alleges that scientific staff at Health Canada knew about the danger posed
    by the implants, including their unsuitability for prolonged implantation.  In those circumstances, the appellant alleges
    that members of Health
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    ’s
    senior staff were negligent in failing to prohibit the devices and to warn the
    public and users about their risks.  The
    appellant argues that, by its negligence, Health Canada increased the risk of
    harm to implant users.  The appellant
    pleads that Canadian residents hold a reasonable expectation that all medical
    devices comply with the regulatory scheme.  Accordingly, he argues, Health Canada owed consumers, including the
    appellant, a private law duty of care.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>The claim focuses on Health
    Canada’s alleged negligence in its dealings with Vitek Inc. (Vitek), an implant
    manufacturer.  The appellant alleges
    that, from 1983, Health Canada failed to require Vitek to obtain a Notice of
    Compliance for its implants and, pending such a Notice, to prevent the sale of,
    or issue warnings about, the implants. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>According to the appellant’s
    pleadings, in 1987, Vitek applied for a Notice of Compliance.  Health Canada rejected Vitek’s application, requested
    further data and issued a direction prohibiting the sale of Vitek
    implants.  In response, Vitek argued that
    a Notice of Compliance was only needed for “new” devices and, since its devices
    predated the 1983 regulatory amendments, they were “grandfathered”.  Nonetheless, Vitek filed a revised submission
    in 1988.  At that time, Health Canada asked
    Vitek for safety and efficacy test results.  Health Canada also listed Vitek implants in its database as though they
    had received a Notice of Compliance.  Health Canada compounded the mistake in its 1989 newsletter where it listed
    Vitek as compliant.  The appellant pleads
    that, when Health Canada recognized its mistakes, it took no steps to inform
    the medical profession or the public about Vitek’s non-compliant devices.  In addition to Health Canada’s specific
    dealings with Vitek, the appellant pleads that Health Canada negligently
    regulated all TMJ implants.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>The appellant relies on other
    allegations of negligence.  In 1990,
    Instrumentarium Inc., a Canadian distributor, issued a recall of Vitek’s TMJ
    implants and notified surgeons about the recall.  The same year, the U.S. authorities notified
    Health Canada that it was recalling Vitek implants.  In 1991, Health Canada asked specific
    voluntary professional associations to publish and disseminate information
    about Vitek implants.  Yet, the appellant
    pleads that Health Canada did not make the same request of professional
    regulatory authorities or hospitals, and waited until 1994 to issue a National
    Import Alert to prevent entry of the implants into Canada.  Finally, the claim pleads, Health Canada
    never disseminated any information about the implants to the public.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>The appellant alleges Health
    Canada negligently failed to prohibit, test, assess, monitor and warn about the
    devices.  He also alleges that Health
    Canada was negligent in applying a risk-benefit analysis to all implants,
    including Vitek implants.  As well, the
    appellant alleges negligence on the part of Health
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    in grandfathering old
    devices; in failing to enforce the Act and regulations, including labelling
    requirements; and in failing “to respond to requests for information made by
    members of the public concerning devices”.  The appellant also alleges Health Canada was negligent in failing to provide
    an information package to the public regarding all TMJ implants and in allowing
    a recall of implants without informing the recipients about their risks.  The appellant argues a proximate relationship
    based on Health
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    ’s
    implementation of policies by “partial” and “inadequate” measures, which, he
    alleges, created a “relationship of dependency by members of the public” on
    Health
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  The appellant argues that this negligence,
    which is alleged to be gross negligence, was operational in nature.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>In his factum, the appellant
    summarizes his claim concisely, saying that he, as well as all users of the
    implants and medical professionals, reasonably expected that all implanted medical
    devices had been approved by Health
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    in accordance with its
    statutory scheme.  Accordingly, he
    argues, in the absence of any warning from Health Canada, he was entitled to
    assume the TMJ implant was an approved and compliant device.  Since Health Canada allegedly knew that the
    device was unsuitable, dangerous and unlabelled, it was under a duty to stop
    the sale and to warn individual consumers.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>I note that the claim in this case
    is solely against Health Canada.  The
    appellant makes no claim against the parties named in Health Canada’s third
    party claim, including the TMJ manufacturers.  Finally, according to the pleadings, the appellant’s factum, and the
    undertaking of appellant’s counsel, the claim is only for Health Canada’s
    “several” liability, which the appellant intended to be a claim only for damages
    caused by Health Canada, and not for those caused by any of the third parties. </span></p>
  <h3><i>            The legislative scheme</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>The applicable legislative scheme
    is the same one discussed in <i>Attis,</i> including
    the <i>Department of Health Act</i>, S.C.
    1996 c. 8<i> </i>and the <i>FDA</i>.  The regulations under the FDA were,
    initially, the Food and Drug Regulations, C.R.C. (1955) (the FDR).  The <i>FDR</i> later became the <i>Medical Devices Regulations</i>, currently
    SOR/98-282 (the <i>MDR</i>).  Section 18 under the earlier version of the <i>FDA</i> (S.C. 1952-53, c. 38), later s. 19
    of the <i>FDA</i>, provides that “[n]o
    person shall sell any device that, when used according to directions or under
    such conditions as are customary or usual, may cause injury to the health of
    the purchaser or user thereof.”  </span></p>

lang=EN>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>Section 20 of the <i>FDA</i> prohibits labelling, packaging,
    treating, processing, selling, or advertising any device in a manner that is
    misleading regarding the item’s “design, construction, performance, intended
    use, quantity, character, value, composition, merit or safety”.  A similar provision was contained in s. 19 of
    the earlier version of the <i>FDA</i>.  The <i>FDA</i><a
name="KVWin_undoend"></a> further provides, under s. 21 (previously s. 20),
    that where a standard has been prescribed for a device, no person shall label,
    package, sell or advertise any article in such a manner that it is likely to be
    mistaken for such device, unless the article complies with the prescribed

    the appellant’s allegation that the Crown failed to require labelling did not
    “materially alter” the trial judge’s conclusion because that inability, not the
    cause of the inability, was itself fatal to the appellant’s claim.  In the motion judge’s view, the scope of any

    Vitek implant.  However, the motion judge
    was also of the view that the appellant could not lay the blame for his
    inability to name the manufacturer on Health Canada because any duty on Health
    Canada to ensure proper product labelling was not owed to the appellant or the
    individual user.  Any such duty was owed
    only to the public at large.  Thus, the

    operational or policy decisions.  In my
    view, this distracted the analysis from the proper first-stage consideration of
    proximity.  The Supreme Court of Canada
    has specifically instructed that the question of proximity must be addressed
    first.  This is because proximity depends
    on the relationship between the parties.  In the absence of a proximate relationship,
    there is no duty of care and no need to consider second-stage policy
    considerations.  The Supreme Court of
    Canada has clearly instructed that the question of whether the challenged
    decision was of an operational or policy nature belongs at the second stage:
    see <i>Cooper v. Hobart</i>, [2001] 3 S.C.R.
    537 and <i>Edwards v. Law Society of Upper
    Canada</i>, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 562.<i>  </i>At para. 38 of <i>Cooper</i>,<i> </i>McLachlin C.J.
    and Major J. explained that government immunity from liability for policy
    decisions, as contrasted with operational decisions, is provided “because of
    considerations outside the relationship for policy reasons -- more precisely,
    because it is inappropriate for courts to second-guess elected legislators on
    policy matters.”   Thus, immunity for
    policy decisions is not dependent on the relationship between the parties.  The analysis must proceed as mandated by the
    Supreme Court of Canada.  </span></p>

    the appellant’s pleadings to determine whether they could support a <i>prima</i> <i>facie</i> duty of care.  The

    given case on a pleadings motion.  Specifically, <i>Attis</i> reviews the duty of care test on a motion to strike and the current

lang=EN>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>As I observed in <i>Attis</i>, the legislative scheme in place
    at the time does not support a finding of proximity.  The scheme was aimed at regulating devices
    with the cooperation of the industry.  It
    required manufacturers, distributors and importers to take responsibility for
    product safety and to comply with certain requirements, including providing
    proper labels, product monographs and requested safety information.  Manufacturers and distributors were required
    not to sell non-compliant devices.  </span></p>

    compliance, enforcement was entirely discretionary. It was not mandatory.  Moreover, the legislative scheme envisaged no
    relationship between Health Canada and the consumer of the medical
    devices.  It follows that a private law
    duty of care to the individual consumer cannot be inferred from the regulatory
    scheme.  While undoubtedly Health Canada owed
    a public law duty of care to the residents of Canada generally, the law is
    clear that a breach of such a public law duty does not give rise to a private
    law cause of action.  </span></p>

    the parties’ reasonable expectations, representations or reliance demonstrate a
    close and direct relationship, there may be a basis to conclude that it is fair

    McLachlin C.J. referred to the duty of those who exercise a public function or
    offer a service to the general public that includes “implied responsibilities
    to the public at large” together with “attendant responsibilities to act with
    special care to reduce risk.” At para. 39, McLachlin C.J. observed that “the
    law does not impose a duty [on third parties] to eliminate risk”, except where
    those third parties “have a special relationship to the person in danger or a
    material role in the creation or management of the risk”.  However, whether such a duty arises depends
    on the reasonable reliance and expectations of the parties (<i>Childs</i> at para. 40).  </span></p>

lang=EN>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>In my view, neither <i>Childs</i>, nor the cases referred to in <i>Childs</i>, assist the appellant in this
    case.  <i>Dunn</i> involved the liability of a railway company where a railway
    conductor ejected a drunken passenger in an isolated area late at night.  The passenger was later found dead on the
    railway tracks.  The passenger’s estate
    succeeded in a claim against the railway company in negligence for leaving the
    passenger at risk when he was not able to take care of himself.  Thus, a relationship of proximity is readily demonstrated
    on the facts of the case. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>Similarly, <i>Jordan House Ltd. </i>dealt with a proximate relationship where a
    commercial host, a tavern, was found negligent for continuing to serve and then
    evicting a patron who was too intoxicated to care for himself.  The relationship in that case was held to be
    that of invitor/invitee and, accordingly, was proximate.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>Finally, <i>Doe </i>involved the relationship between the police and the plaintiff,
    who was one of a discrete group of potential victims of a known rapist.  Not only did the police fail in their duty to
    warn Doe of her vulnerability, they decided not to do so in order to use her as
    bait to apprehend the perpetrator.  MacFarland
    J. also noted the statutory context of s. 57 of the <i>Police Act</i>, R.S.O. 1980, c. 381, which specifically charged members
    of police forces with the duty of preventing crimes.  There is no such statutory context in this
    case.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>In contrast to <i>Doe</i>, neither the enabling legislation of
    the <i>FDA</i> nor the parties’ reasonable
    expectations and reliance focused responsibility for product safety on Health
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  Instead, both the statutory framework and the
    parties’ reasonable expectations placed the responsibility for product safety on
    the medical devices industry.   </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>Accordingly, I do not read the relevant
    portions of <i>Childs</i> as creating a new
    ground for a relationship of proximity.  It
    appears that the concept of “material implication” in the creation or
    management of risk (para. 38 of <i>Childs</i>)
    is simply another way of engaging the proximity factors of representation, expectation
    and reliance.  I find support for this
    interpretation in para. 40 of <i>Childs</i> where McLachlin C.J. recognizes that the theme of “reasonable reliance” unites
    all examples of liability. </span></p>

    erred to the extent he assumed that, without more, conduct that increases risk creates
    a relationship of proximity.  </span></p>

    to the appellant’s pleadings about his expectations, representations, and
    reliance on Health
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    regarding the safety of the TMJ implants.  The pleadings do not contain, and there is no suggestion they could
    contain, any allegations of direct interaction or communication with particular
    Health Canada employees or the receipt of, or reliance upon, some assurance
    regarding the safety of the implants.  However,
    the pleadings include three allegations that distinguish the claim from that in <i>Attis</i>.  The first is that “Health Canada represented
    that it monitored the effectiveness of recalls by manufacturers and took a lead
    role in alerting the public of recalls and safety concerns.”  The second is that, in 1983, Health Canada
    issued an information letter explaining that the issuance of a Notice of
    Compliance “meant that Health Canada was satisfied that the manufacturer had
    carried out tests and had submitted appropriate results to Health Canada to
    demonstrate a reasonable probability of safety of the devices and effectiveness
    of the devices in humans.”  The third is that
    Health Canada failed “to respond to requests for information made by members of
    the public concerning devices”. </span></p>

lang=EN>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN>The pleadings do not allege that any
    of the three communications came to the appellant’s attention or to the
    attention of any specific member of the public.  Nowhere does the appellant plead a specific
    representation made to him by Health Canada. Moreover, nowhere does the
    appellant assert reliance, other than by pleading that members of the public generally
    relied on Health Canada to implement its public law duties.  In the absence of a specific representation
    or reliance on Health Canada regarding the safety of the implant, in my view, it
    is plain and obvious that the appellant cannot establish a direct and close
    relationship of proximity that makes it just and fair to impose a private law duty
    of care on Health Canada. </span></p>

    ’s
    2007 website in his factum as providing direct representations about product
    safety.  In argument, the appellant
    conceded that the website was neither pleaded nor was it material to the
    allegations in his pleading.  Accordingly, I have not considered any representations made by Health
    Canada outside those alleged in the pleading. </span></p>

    of proximity, I agree with the motion judge that there is no purpose in

    that, had there been a finding of proximity, the negligence in this case,
    particularly a dissemination of a list including non-compliant devices, could
    be characterized as operational error: see <i>Just
    v. British Columbia</i>, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 1228.  In those circumstances, it would have been necessary to consider the
    other second stage residual policy considerations to determine whether they
    raise sufficient reason to negative the imposition of liability.  However, it is unnecessary to consider those
    issues in light of the conclusion I would reach on the issue of proximity. </span></p>
