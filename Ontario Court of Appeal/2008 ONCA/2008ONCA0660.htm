    negligence in relation to the government’s regulation of breast implants.  It arises from a certification motion under
    the <i>Class Proceedings Act, 1992, </i>S.O.
    1992, c. 6 (the <i>CPA</i>), in which the motion
    judge, Winkler R.S.J., dismissed the appellants’ proposed class proceeding and
    awarded costs to the respondents fixed at $125,000.  He concluded that, plainly and obviously, the
    claim disclosed no cause of action because the underlying legislative and
    regulatory scheme did not support the appellants’ argument that the respondent
    owed them a private law duty of care.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The claim alleges that the respondent, Her Majesty the

    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    ), breached its duty to properly
    regulate medical devices, namely, silicone breast implants.  Such devices are regulated under the auspices
    of the <i>Food and Drugs Act</i>, R.S.C.
    1985, c. F-27 (the <i>FDA</i> or the Act)
    and the regulations under that Act<i>. </i> </p>

  <h3><i><span lang=EN-US>The parties</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants, Joyce Attis and Alexandra Tesluk, were
    implanted with silicone gel Dow Corning breast implants.  Ms. Attis received one implant in 1972; it
    was removed in 1992.  Ms. Tesluk received
    two implants in 1980; they were removed in 1994.  Both appellants allege that their implants
    leaked or ruptured, causing them catastrophic medical consequences and
    permanent disabilities.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  Both appellants
    were members of a class of plaintiffs that sued Dow Corning Corporation and
    other breast implant manufacturers in an earlier and separate class
    proceeding.  Ms. Attis opted out of that
    proceeding in 1994.  In 1998, the
    proceeding resolved pursuant to a court-approved settlement; however, counsel
    advise that Ms. Tesluk only received nominal damages from the settlement.  After the settlement, the appellants commenced
    this proceeding against Health Canada on behalf of a putative class consisting
    of residents of Canada (except British Columbia) who received Dow Corning
    breast implants between 1962 and 1992.  This class is said to include approximately
    29,500 individuals. </p>
  <h3><i>The appellants</i>’<i> claim</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In their claim and reply, the appellants plead that the <i>FDA</i> imposed a duty on Health Canada
    to ensure that individual members of the Canadian public were protected from
    devices that might cause them harm.  The appellants
    plead that they relied upon Health Canada to comply with that duty, which they
    describe as a duty to promote and maintain the health and safety of individual
    Canadians, and to ensure that all medical devices are safe.  The appellants allege that, to comply with
    that duty, Canada established a comprehensive system of regulation, which it
    was obliged to operate without negligence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants plead that, as a result of information
    from various governments and organizations warning that the implants “may cause
    injury” or may cause varying degrees of harm to implant recipients, Health
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    knew or
    ought to have known about the unsuitability of the implants.  This unsuitability is alleged to include the
    implants’ predilection to failure,<a href="#_ftn2"
name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a> deterioration, disintegration and leakage.  In particular, the appellants plead that the Crown’s “ministers or
    senior public servants” ignored warnings from “senior scientific and medical
    staff” regarding the implants.  The
    appellants further plead gross negligence based on Health
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    ’s
    failures, including its failures to test, ban,  recall,  or warn the appellants about the hazards of the
    implants, as well as its failure </p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>to establish a remediation
    program.  The appellants describe the
    alleged negligence as relating to operational decisions made by Health Canada in
    the course of its operation of the statutory scheme.  The appellants also claim that, since at
    least 1975, Health Canada was negligent in applying a risk-benefit analysis in
    assessing medical devices.  They plead
    such an analysis is both <i>ultra vires</i> Health
    Canada’s legislative mandate and grossly negligent.  Finally, according to the appellants, Health
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    negligently failed to enforce the requirements of the regulations from 1988
    until 1994.  </p>
  <h3><i>The legislative scheme</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The umbrella legislation dealing with the administration
    of health in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    is the <i>Department of Health Act</i>, S.C.
    1996, c. 8.  Section 4(1) of that Act gives
    the Minister of Health powers and duties relating to “the promotion and
    preservation of the health of the people of
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    ”.  Section 4(2)(a) gives the Minister the
    authority to administer statutes and regulations related “to the health of the
    people of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    .”  Section 4(2)(b) gives the Minister power
    relating to the “protection of the people of Canada against risks to health and the
    spreading of diseases”, while s. 4(2)(d) gives the Minister the
    authority to establish and control “safety standards and safety information
    requirements for consumer products”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The specific legislative scheme that addresses medical
    devices is the <i>FDA</i> and its regulations.  Initially in s. 18,<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[3]</span></span></span></a> and later in s. 19, the <i>FDA</i> provides
    that “[n]o person shall sell any device that, when used according to directions
    or under such conditions as are customary or usual, may cause injury to the
    health of the purchaser or user thereof.”   Part II of the <i>FDA</i> provides
    inspectors with the power to administer the legislative scheme.  Inspectors may enter premises and examine articles
    (s. 23(1)) and submit a seized article to an analyst (s. 29(1)).  Section 30(1) authorizes the Governor in
    Council to make regulations “for carrying the purposes and provisions of this
    Act into effect”.  This power includes
    regulating manufacturers and distributors of devices to prevent the consumer
    from being “deceived or misled” about a product (s. 30(1)(b)) and to promote “the  prevention of injury [to] the health of the
    purchaser or consumer” (s. 30(1)(e)).  Finally, s. 31 provides for fines and imprisonment to enforce the
    legislation and its regulations.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The original regulations, the <i>Food and Drug Regulations</i> (the <i>FDR</i>)
    were replaced by the <i>Medical Devices
    Regulations</i> (the <i>MDR</i>).  The regulations became progressively more
    detailed over time.  In 1972, when Mrs. Attis received her implant, the FDR,
    C.R.C. (1955) were in force.<a href="#_ftn4"
name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[4]</span></span></span></a>  Under that regime, manufacturers were neither
    required to provide information to Health Canada, nor to seek authorization
    prior to importing or selling devices in Canada.  However, inspectors and analysts had the
    authority to obtain samples and to examine or detain devices.  In 1974, the amended <i>FDR</i>, SOR/74-133 allowed the regulator to request evidence regarding
    the safety of the device for its recommended purpose and to prohibit the sale
    of a device pending receipt of sufficient evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From 1975 to 1982, the time frame when Ms. Tesluk
    received her implants, the relevant provisions of the <i>FDR</i> were replaced by the <i>MDR</i>,
    SOR/75-526.  The MDR required
    manufacturers to furnish Health
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    with “notification” within ten days from the date of the first sale of a
    medical device.  The notification was
    required to include particulars about the device, its performance
    characteristics and directions for use.  Before selling a device, manufacturers were required to conduct tests to
    justify the benefits and performance characteristics claimed.  In addition, Health Canada had the discretion
    to require manufacturers to provide safety and efficacy evidence, failing which
    Health Canada could prohibit the sale of the device.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From 1982 to 1998, medical implant manufacturers were obliged
    to submit to Health
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    safety and efficacy tests, but only regarding any “new” product (C.R.C., c.
    871, SOR/82-914).  If satisfied with the
    results, Health Canada would issue a Notice of Compliance regarding the device.  Devices already on the market, including
    existing breast implant devices, were excluded from this requirement.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 1998, the regulations were amended to provide for a
    licensing scheme, which is not relevant to the time frame under consideration
    in this appeal.  The licensing scheme
    places more requirements on the medical devices industry: see SOR/98-282.  No version of the regulations required or
    authorized Health Canada to notify users of any product warnings.</p>
  <h3><i>The motion judge</i>’<i>s decision</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge dismissed the motion for certification
    on the basis that the appellants’ pleadings failed to disclose a cause of
    action as required by s. 5(1)(a) of the <i>CPA</i>.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Usually, such a pleadings motion is decided on the
    basis of the statement of claim.  However, in this case, the motion was heard after a complete exchange of
    pleadings.  In argument, the appellants
    referred not only to their amended statement of claim, but also to their reply.
     No objection was taken to the additional
    reference to the reply, which in any event served as an amended claim for the purpose
    of strengthening the appellants’ original statement of claim.  The reply also accepted some of the pleadings
    in Health Canada’s statement of defence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his reasons at para. 33, the motion judge quoted a
    paragraph from the statement of defence that was not admitted in the
    appellants’ reply.  Given the nature of
    the motion, this reference was in error.<span class=MsoFootnoteReference> <a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[5]</span></span></a></span>  However, there are two reasons why the
    reference does not affect the result.  First, it appears the reference simply describes the regulatory scheme
    that is in any event referenced in the statement of claim and interprets that
    scheme in a manner consistent with the legislation’s purpose.  Thus, the reference is immaterial.  Second, the fact that neither party raised
    this issue on the appeal supports the view that the extract from the statement
    of defence was not considered by the parties to be controversial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the balance of his reasons, the motion judge
    considered the analytical framework that evolved from the House of Lords’
    decision in <i>Anns v. Merton London Borough
    Council</i>, [1978] A.C. 728, including the Supreme Court of Canada’s<b> </b>clarification of that framework in the
    regulatory negligence context in <i>Cooper
    v. Hobart</i>, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 537 and <i>Edwards v. Law Society of Upper
    Canada</i>, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 562.  In
    particular, the motion judge noted, at para. 26, the <i>Edwards</i> requirement that “[f]actors giving rise to proximity must
    be grounded in the governing statute when there is one, as in the present case”
    (<i>Edwards</i> at para. 9).  The motion judge then determined, at para. 27,
    that “no analogous duty of care of the nature alleged in this case had been
    recognized previously.”  He further
    concluded, at para. 28 that, while the statutory and regulatory scheme under
    the <i>FDA</i> imposes duties on
    manufacturers and importers of medical devices, it was plain and obvious that
    “no such obligations are attributed to the government so as to create a private
    law duty of care”, as opposed to a duty of care to the public as a whole.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge gave two reasons for concluding the
    appellants failed to establish a private law duty of care on the part of Health
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  First, he interpreted s. 19 of the <i>FDA</i> as imposing a duty of care on the
    seller, rather than on the government.  Second, he rejected the appellants’ argument that Health Canada’s
    alleged negligence arose from “operational”, as opposed to “policy”,
    decisions.  The motion judge
    distinguished the cases of <i>Finney v.
    Barreau du Québec</i>, [2004] 2 S.C.R. 17, <i>Swanson
    Estate v. Canada </i>(1991), 80 D.L.R. (4th) 741 (F.C.A.), and <i>Baric v. Tomalk</i> (2006), 38 C.C.L.T. (3d)

    S.C.),
    which were relied upon by the appellants.  He noted that those cases challenged specific
    regulatory conduct dealing with individual and corporate breaches of
    regulations.  The motion judge distinguished <i>Finney</i> and <i>Swanson</i> on the basis that specific complaints were made to the
    regulator in those cases.  That was not
    the situation in this case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge also distinguished <i>Baric</i> on the basis that the regulatory
    inspectors in that case took no action regarding the company’s known numerous
    and specific regulatory breaches.  He
    concluded that the essence of the appellants’ claim against the government was different
    and that it was properly characterized as a failure to comply with a “duty to
    prohibit” the devices, a duty he found to be akin to a “duty to govern”.  Since a failure to govern or prohibit “is a
    manifest policy decision”, the motion judge concluded that Health Canada was immune
    from civil liability (para. 42).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge observed that two recent Ontario

    (3d) 321 (C.A.), “uphold the right of the government to govern in the general

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, the motion judge concluded that the

    action “cannot possibly succeed”.  Under
    this test, the motion judge was required to accept the factual pleadings as
    proven and to read the claim generously.  In addition, the test requires that a claim not be dismissed simply
    because it asserts a novel cause of action: see <i>Hollick v.

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parameters of government liability for regulatory
    negligence continue to evolve.  We have
    moved from a system of complete Crown immunity to one where a government may be
    held liable in tort.  In 1953,
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    enacted the <i>Crown Liability Act</i>, S.C.
    1952-53, c. 30, which is now the <i>Crown
    Liability and Proceedings Act</i>,<i> </i>R.S.C.
    1985, c. C-50.  Section 3(b)(i) of that Act
    provides that “[t]he Crown is liable for the damages for which, if it were a
    person, it would be liable … in respect of a tort committed by a servant of the
    Crown.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As is the case with tort liability generally, Crown
    liability requires the plaintiff to establish the foundational component of a
    duty of care.  In 1977, the seminal
    decision of the House of Lords in <i>Anns</i> advanced a two-stage test for determining the presence of such a duty.  The test was refined<i> </i>by the Supreme Court of Canada in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    <i>Kamloops</i><i> (City) v. Nielsen</i>, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 2,
    and later in <i>Cooper</i> and <i>Edwards</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In examining whether a duty of care is present, a court
    must first inquire whether the harm that occurred was the  reasonably foreseeable consequence of the
    defendant’s conduct.  If foreseeability
    is established, the question becomes whether the parties were in a relationship
    of proximity to support a duty of care.  If
    a court finds both foreseeability and proximity, it must then inquire at the
    second stage of the analysis whether any residual policy considerations negative
    the imposition of a duty of care.  Thus,
    the <i>Anns </i>analysis affirms the
    “neighbour” principle, familiar from <i>Donoghue
    v. Stevenson</i>, [1932] A.C. 562 (H.L.), in the first stage.  At the second stage, it recognizes that
    broader policy considerations may render the imposition of liability
    unreasonable.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This does not mean, however, that policy considerations
    are restricted to the second stage of the analysis.  Policy considerations can apply at both
    stages of the analysis, although they differ in nature.  In <i>Syl
    Apps Treatment Centre v. B.D.</i>, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 83, at para. 32, Abella J. explained
    that policy considerations at the first stage include factors relating to the
    relationship between the parties, while policy considerations at the second
    stage address larger issues outside the parties’ relationship.  Further, in <i>Hill v. Hamilton-Wentworth Regional Police Services Board</i>, [2007] 3
    S.C.R. 129, McLachlin C.J., writing for the majority, acknowledged at para. 31
    that “there may be overlap between stage one and stage two [policy] considerations”
    and that “[t]he important thing is that in deciding whether a duty of care
    lies, all relevant concerns should be considered.”    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The different stages of the analysis invoke different
    burdens of proof.  The plaintiff bears
    the burden of establishing a <i>prima facie</i> duty of care by showing foreseeability and proximity at the first stage.  The defendant then has the burden of
    demonstrating the countervailing policy considerations at the second stage: see <i>Childs</i> <i>v. Desormeaux, </i>[2006] 1 S.C.R. 643, at para. 13.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the context of regulatory negligence, two leading
    decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada considered the parameters of a
    regulator’s duty of care to the consumer in relation to a product or
    service.  <i>Cooper</i> involved a proposed class action against the regulator of
    mortgage brokers.  The representative investor,
    one of 3000 investors, alleged that the registrar of the regulatory body ought
    to have suspended a particular mortgage broker’s licence as soon as the
    registrar became aware of the broker’s statutory violations.  The registrar’s failure to take prompt
    action, argued the investor, caused investors to incur losses for which they
    sought compensation.  The Supreme Court
    of Canada concluded that the registrar owed no duty of care because the
    registrar did not have a proximate relationship with the investors regarding their
    particular investments.  The regulator’s
    duty was not to these individuals, but to the public as a whole.  That duty was owed to ensure the efficient
    operation of the mortgage marketplace.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the companion case of <i>Edwards</i>, the Supreme Court also concluded that the regulator, the
    Law Society of Upper Canada, owed no private law duty of care because the
    parties’ relationship was not proximate.  In <i>Edwards</i>, the plaintiffs deposited
    funds into a lawyer’s trust account; however, they did so not as legal clients,
    but rather as investors.  Thus, the
    deposits were unrelated to the lawyer’s professional practice.  In those circumstances, there was no
    proximate relationship between the Law Society and the investors.  The investors, the court said at para. 18,
    were only “participants in a third party business promotion.”  Accordingly, the Law Society could owe them no
    duty of care under the <i>Law Society Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. L.8.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In litigation against the government, the Supreme Court
    of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    specifically instructed in <i>Cooper</i> at
    para. 43 that “the factors giving rise to proximity, if they exist, must arise
    from the statute” because, apart from the statute, the alleged wrongdoer is “in
    no different position than the ordinary man or woman on the street.”  However, other decisions, including <i>Finney</i>, also hold that the question of
    proximity is informed by considerations relevant to the relationship between
    the plaintiffs and the government, including considerations arising from the
    specifics of their actual interaction.  I
    will discuss this issue further below.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Cooper </i>and <i>Edwards</i> also instructed that whether a government
    decision is operational or policy-oriented is a consideration that belongs at
    the second stage of the <i>Anns</i> analysis.  <i>Cooper</i> explained, at para. 38, that this is because government
    immunity for policy decisions is not based on the parties’ relationship, but “is
    better viewed as an immunity imposed because of considerations outside the
    relationship for policy reasons -- more precisely, because it is inappropriate
    for courts to second-guess elected legislators on policy matters.”  Thus, the operational/policy distinction,
    which was once considered the starting point for the analysis of government
    liability in negligence, now belongs at the second stage. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The distinction between government operational decisions
    and policy decisions was considered by the Supreme Court of Canada in<i> Wellbridge Holdings Ltd. v. Greater Winnipeg</i>,
    [1971] S.C.R. 957.  That case concerned a
    zoning by-law relied upon by a builder in deciding to develop an apartment
    building.  When the by-law was
    subsequently declared invalid, the builder sued the municipality in negligence
    for damages for passing a by-law that was invalid.  His action was ultimately dismissed.  Laskin J. concluded that, since the passage of
    the by-law was an exercise of policy or legislative authority undertaken for
    the benefit of the general public, the decision to pass the by-law could not
    support a private law duty of care to the individual.  In arriving at this conclusion, Laskin J.
    emphasized that the result would have been different had the challenged conduct
    been operational in nature.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Eighteen years after <i>Wellbridge</i>, the Supreme Court of Canada re-examined the distinction
    between policy and operational decisions in<i> Just v. British Columbia</i>, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 1228.  The issue in that case was whether the
    province was liable in tort for negligence where a rock fell onto a highway, which
    the province was responsible for maintaining, and caused injury to the
    plaintiffs.  Cory J., for the majority,
    concluded that the government owed a duty of care to the plaintiffs because the
    road maintenance at issue involved operational decisions, rather than planning
    or policy decisions.  At p. 1245, he
    noted that, generally, “decisions concerning budgetary allotments for
    departments or government agencies will be classified as policy decisions.”  Such decisions are immune from liability, he
    explained at p. 1239, because of the difficulties inherent in governing and the
    basic premise that “the Crown … must be free to govern.”  In <i>Brown
    v.
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    British Columbia
    (Minister of Transportation and Highway)</i>, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 420, at p. 441, Cory
    J., again writing for the majority, elaborated.  He described policy decisions as ones usually “<span lang=EN-US
style='letter-spacing:-.15pt;'>dictated by financial,
    economic, social and political factors or constraints”, while operational
    decisions perform or carry out the policy “on the basis of administrative
    direction, expert or professional opinion, technical standards or general
    standards of reasonableness”: see also </span><i>Swinamer v. Nova Scotia (Attorney General)</i>, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 445, at
    p. 465.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, a determination of whether a pleading puts
    forward a tenable cause of action requires consideration of foreseeability and
    proximity at the first stage, including policy considerations relevant to the
    relationship between the parties, and consideration of residual policy
    considerations of a broader nature at the second stage, including the question
    of whether the nature of the government’s decision (policy or operational)
    supports immunity from a duty of care.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> However, the
    Supreme Court of Canada has also instructed that, if a particular relationship
    has already been recognized as falling into a category of duty of care, it is
    unnecessary to undertake a proximity analysis.  As the Supreme Court stated at para. 36 of <i>Cooper</i>, “When a case falls within one of these situations [where proximity
    has been recognized] or an analogous one and reasonable foreseeability is
    established, a <i>prima facie</i> duty of
    care may be posited”: see also <i>Odhavji Estate v. Woodhouse</i>, [2003] 3
    S.C.R. 263.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I take it from this that an allegation of a duty
    of care also does not require an <i>Anns</i> analysis if the relationship at issue has been recognized as one that attracts
    immunity from liability.  <span
style='color:black'>Accordingly, as a preliminary manner, I turn to the issue
    of whether this case falls into a recognized category of proximity or of
    immunity. </span></p>
  <h3>(b)<i>       Does a pre-existing
    category of regulatory negligence give rise to a duty of care in this case?</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether a particular case falls within a recognized
    category is not always straightforward.  <i>Cooper</i>, at para. 36, lists recognized
    categories of care.  Certain categories
    seem to fit the circumstances of this case, at least when viewed broadly.  For example, this case presents allegations
    of governmental operational negligence, physical harm to the plaintiffs, and a
    breach of a duty to warn.  These
    relationships are listed in <i>Cooper</i> as
    recognized categories.  On the other
    hand, a category of government immunity from liability for a breach of a
    statutory duty was also recognized in <i><span
style='color:black'>Holland v. Saskatchewan, </span></i><span style='color:

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether this case fits within or is analogous to a

    the applicability of the authorities relied upon by the appellants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the appellants argue that the government undertook
    to implement a program of regulation and it did so negligently.  The appellants also argue that they relied on
    the government to protect them from any hazards posed by the medical devices
    that the government regulated.  This type
    of regulatory negligence, they argue, is a recognized category of tort
    liability. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The allegations include pleadings that Health Canada
    was negligent in failing to: issue a ban or warning about the devices; seize,
    monitor or test the devices; remediate the consequences of the failed devices;
    and enforce the regulations against the manufacturers and distributors.  The pleadings also allege that Health Canada
    was negligent in applying a risk-benefit analysis to the implants.  In summary, the claim alleges that Health
    Canada failed to take action in the face of a known risk and, in doing so,
    acted contrary to its duty to protect consumers.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In support of their argument that regulatory negligence
    falls into a recognized category of liability, the appellants rely on cases
    where a government regulator was found to owe a private law duty of care,
    particularly the cases of <i>Swanson,</i> <i>Finney</i> and <i>Baric</i>.  In my view, the
    relationships in these cases are distinguishable from the relationship in this
    case.  As such, I am not persuaded that
    this case falls within a recognized or analogous category of proximate relationship.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I begin with <i>Swanson</i>,
    which the appellants argue established a recognized category of a duty of care imposed
    on government regulators, particularly in relation to matters of public
    safety.  In <i>Swanson</i>, the airline regulator learned through investigation and
    employee complaints that a particular air carrier was engaged in unsafe
    practices.  The regulator, who took some
    action based on the complaints, nevertheless permitted the air carrier to
    continue to fly.  A crash followed.  In concluding that the regulator was liable
    for the resulting damages, Linden J.A., writing for the Federal Court of Appeal,
    observed that the regulator’s challenged decisions were operational in
    nature.  Not only did the decisions not
    involve any balancing of either political or economic obligations, but the
    regulator’s own operation manuals required the regulator to take action<span
lang=EN>.  Accordingly, the finding of a duty in <i>Swanson</i> was based on the
    policy/operational distinction.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Importantly, <i>Swanson</i> pre-dates the <i>Cooper</i> and <i>Edwards</i> decisions that changed the
    analysis, both by emphasizing the importance of proximity at the first stage
    and by directing that <span lang=EN>the operational/policy distinction </span>is properly considered at the
    second stage of the analysis.  <i>Swanson</i> was decided on the basis of the
    policy/operational distinction without a preliminary consideration of the
    question of proximity.  <i>Cooper</i> and <i>Edwards</i> make it clear that a finding of proximity is a required
    element of a duty of care.  Operational
    negligence, in the absence of a proximate relationship, is not sufficient to
    give rise to a duty of care.  As such, <i>Swanson</i> does not assist the appellants’
    argument. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Finney, </i>the
    Supreme Court imposed a duty of care on the Barreau du Québec where the
    Barreau, the regulator of members of the legal profession, failed to act in
    good faith.  The Barreau failed to take
    action against a lawyer in the face of repeated complaints by the plaintiff to
    the regulator about the lawyer’s misconduct.  In light of the lawyer’s prior poor disciplinary record, the court
    observed that the Barreau’s failure to follow up on the plaintiff’s complaints was
    particularly egregious.  While <i>Finney</i> was decided under the civil law
    system, and in the context of a legislative immunity provision, the Supreme
    Court observed at para. 46 that the result would have been the same on the
    basis of the <i>Edwards</i> and <i>Cooper </i>common law analysis because “<span
lang=EN>[t]he decisions
    made by the Barreau … were made in a relationship of proximity with a clearly
    identified complainant, where the harm was foreseeable.”  This interaction in <i>Finney</i> satisfied the proximity test since it occurred within the
    regulated professional relationship and there had been direct, close and
    repeated contact between the complainant and the regulator.  As I will discuss below, no comparable direct
    interaction occurred between the appellants and Health Canada, which makes this
    relationship quite different from the one in <i>Finney</i>. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the appellants rely heavily on <i>Baric</i> for the principle that regulatory
    negligence is a recognized category.   In <i>Baric</i>,
    the plaintiff alleged negligence on the part of the plaintiff’s doctors in
    relation to the implantation of a temporomandibular joint device in the
    plaintiff’s jaw.  In a third party claim brought
    by the defendant doctors against Health Canada, the defendants pled that Health
    Canada negligently permitted the manufacturer to repeatedly breach the <i>FDR</i>.  They also alleged operational negligence, including Health
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    ’s improper
    listing of the device as compliant, its failure to follow up on known ongoing
    sales of the unregulated device, its participation in an ineffective recall,
    and its delay in enforcing the regulations.  In the face of these operational allegations, the motion judge dismissed
    a motion to strike the third party claim, holding that a trial was necessary to
    determine whether there was a cause of action.  In my view, <i>Baric</i> presents a
    different factual matrix than the one advanced in this case.  Moreover, I am of the opinion that the <i>Baric</i> motion judge would not have
    reached the same result today in light of the intervening case law.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In arriving at her decision, the <i>Baric</i> motion judge relied on the motion
    judge’s decision in <i>Klein v. American
    Medical Systems Inc.</i>,<i> </i>[2005] O.J.
    No. 4910 (Ont. S.C.), which refused to dismiss a claim for regulatory
    negligence against Health Canada relating to the implantation of a medical
    device.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

    decision that, “having created a detailed plan to protect against such devices
    causing physical harm to users”, it was not plain and obvious that Health
    Canada did not have a private law duty of care in implementing that plan.  Accordingly, the <i>Baric</i> motion judge dismissed the motion to strike, observing at
    para. 86 that “[o]nce a government chooses to occupy a regulatory field, it
    must do so without negligence”.  The <i>Baric</i> decision was not appealed.  <i>Klein</i> was appealed.  In <i>Klein</i>,<i> </i>Chapnik J., for
    the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court,
    struck the claim.  She observed at para.
    25 that “[t]here can be no private law duty of care where the purpose of the
    legislative scheme is to facilitate a public authority to act in its discretion
    in the public interest”.  Thus, in my
    view, the Divisional Court in <i>Klein</i> effectively overruled <i>Baric </i>to the
    extent that it could be read as having recognized a category of government
    liability for discretionary regulatory negligence in the context of the medical
    device regulatory regime.  In addition,
    the <i>Baric</i> decision preceded the
    decision of this court in <i>Eliopoulos</i>,
    a decision I will discuss later in these reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition to these three decisions, counsel provided written

    ,
    as opposed to the action against the manufacturer, were contained at para. 91,
    where he stated that whether the government’s actions concerned policy or
    operational decisions required a more complete evidentiary record.  The question of proximity was advanced on
    appeal.  On that issue, this court found
    a sufficient pleading of proximity at para. 62 on the basis of the many express
    “public representations by
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    that it regulated cattle feed<i> to protect
    commercial cattle farmers among others</i>” (emphasis added).  Accordingly, the result in <i>Sauer</i> depended on the allegation of specific
    representations by the government that it was acting in the interests of the
    plaintiffs.  On this basis, <i>Sauer</i> is distinguishable because the appellants
    in this case do not plead any specific representations by Health
    <st1:country-region

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Holland</i>, the
    appellants, a group of game farmers, brought a claim against the federal
    government, regarding a federal program that required each farmer to sign a
    broadly-worded release in order to maintain his or her herd certification
    status.  On judicial review, the releases
    were declared invalid; nonetheless, the government did not restore the farmers’
    certification status.  The game farmers
    sued, seeking a remedy for their financial losses and pleading, among other
    causes of action, the tort of negligence.  Their claim was struck and they appealed to the Supreme Court.  McLachlin C.J., writing for the court, characterized
    the major focus of the claim as one for breach of statutory duty because the allegations
    concerned the government’s failure to act within the authorizing acts and
    regulations.  The Supreme Court ruled
    that this aspect of the claim disclosed no cause of action in tort, and that
    the proper remedy was judicial review.  Even
    if proximity were established, wrote the Chief Justice, residual policy
    considerations militated against recognizing such a cause of action.  At para. 9, McLachlin C.J. reaffirmed the
    principle in <i>Saskatchewan Wheat Pool</i> that there is no recognized category of a duty of care for breach of statutory
    duty.  In contrast, the court held that the
    government’s alleged breach of the order given on judicial review merited an
    evidentiary hearing, since it pleaded a recognized cause of action of <span

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I would reject the appellants’ claim that
    courts have previously recognized a duty of care arising from relationships of
    proximity analogous to the appellants’ relationship with Health Canada.  Indeed, in my view, to the extent the claim
    alleges breach of a statutory duty, such a claim has already been recognized as
    attracting immunity.  Nonetheless, for
    completeness, I will undertake the <i>Anns</i> inquiry to determine whether a novel duty of care should be recognized in the
    circumstances of this case. </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A relationship of proximity was described by the
    Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Hercules
    Management Ltd. v. Ernst &amp; Young</i>, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 165, at para. 24 as one
    “of such a nature that the defendant may be said to be under an obligation to
    be mindful of the plaintiff’s legitimate interests in conducting his or her
    affairs”.  In <i>Cooper</i> at para. 34, McLachlin C.J. and Major J. stated that
    determining the closeness of a relationship may involve “looking at
    expectations, representations, reliance, and the property or other interests
    involved”.  These factors help <span

style='color:black'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However, since <i>Cooper</i> held that a relationship of proximity between a plaintiff
    and a government must be found in the governing statute, I begin with the
    legislative framework.  As I have already
    noted, the umbrella statute of the <i>Department</i> <i>of Health Act</i>, at s. 4, provides that
    the Minister’s obligations are to the people of
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    for the promotion of their health
    and the prevention of risk generally.  Thus,
    under this statute, the Minister’s duty is to the people of
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    as a

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Minister of National Health and Welfare emphasized Health

      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    ’s
    duty to the public as whole in 1953, when he first introduced the <i>FDA</i>.  He also noted that the legislation depended
    upon the cooperation of the industry:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The purpose
    of the bill of course is to protect the Canadian people in matters of health … The
    administration of the measure depends upon the co-operation that the officials
    of the department are able to enjoy with industry ...  The bill is concerned with the prohibition of
    things that are injurious to health and that are unfit for use, and with the
    prevention of deception in the manufacture and sale of goods consumed by the
    public.</p>

lang=EN style='color:black;'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Importantly, s. 19 of the <i>FDA,</i> which deals directly with the safety of medical devices,
    explicitly places the obligation for the safety of the devices on the
    manufacturer and distributor when it says “no person shall sell” any unsafe
    device.  <span style='color:black'>As the

    defined by the appellants simply particularized and provided mechanisms to
    enforce compliance with the legislation’s objective.  A reading of the legislative history of the regulations
    discloses that there was no obligation on Health
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    to undertake safety and
    efficacy testing, or to engage any other compliance or enforcement
    mechanism.  The regulations simply
    authorized Health
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    to enforce the various aspects of the compliance requirements if it chose to do
    so.  Thus, Health
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    was akin
    to an overseer or watchdog, able to employ discretionary, but not mandatory,
    enforcement of the legislative scheme.  Having the means to enforce compliance does not translate into an
    obligation to do so: see <i><span lang=EN

    <st1:country-region

    ).  </span>Like the <i>FDA</i>, the regulations mandate that the medical devices industry is
    responsible for product safety, a responsibility that has become increasingly
    rigorous over time.  The government, like
    the consumer, depends on the manufacturer to ensure product safety.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The regulations in this case did not require
    proof of safety before the sale of a device.  In cases of safety concerns brought to the Minister’s attention, Health
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    had the
    discretion, not the obligation, to request specific testing.  As well, the statutory scheme did not provide
    a complaints process that may have suggested a legislative intent to import a
    private law duty of care.  Neither did
    the scheme provide for a compensation fund similar to those maintained by some
    professional regulatory bodies, a provision that also may have suggested an
    intention to assume responsibility for consumer welfare.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Since an examination of the legislative scheme

    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    , and all obligations are on
    the industry, I conclude that the statute signals an intention that the
    government’s duty is owed to the public as a whole, not to the individual
    consumer.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I find support for this conclusion from two other
    decisions, both of which also considered circumstances that involved public
    safety regulation.  <i>Eliopoulos</i> involved a claim against Ontario’s Minister of Health
    for breach of an alleged private law duty of care to an individual plaintiff to
    control the spread of the West Nile Virus.  Sharpe J.A., writing for this court, concluded that it was plain and
    obvious that there was no such duty because the Minister’s powers under the <i>Health Protection and Promotion Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. H.7 were discretionary and the Minister’s duties were owed to
    the public at large, not to the individual.  Hence, there was no proximate relationship.</p>

    Divisional Court, concluded at para. 33:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span lang=EN>Finally, we agree with the submission of the
    appellant that it is impossible for Health Canada to regulate on behalf of
    individuals directly. Health Canada is not the manufacturer of the device, nor

    manufacturing process and labeling for each particular device, as well as the
    conditions for its intended use … Health

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region

    ’s interaction with the appellants
    create a relationship of proximity?</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I turn to consider the appellants’ further argument
    that a relationship of proximity can be established by operational conduct
    outside the statutory framework based on the interaction between the
    parties.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A discussion of the ways that plaintiffs interact with
    government can overlap with stage two policy considerations because operational
    decisions are more likely to involve interaction than policy decisions.  However, at the first stage the discussion focuses
    on the parties’ expectations, representations and reliance, which informs the
    degree of closeness that is essential for a proximate relationship.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the government interacts with an individual in the
    context of an ordinary accident, the relationship is obviously both close and
    direct.  In contrast, when government
    decides what laws to enact or how to allocate limited resources for the general
    good, it has neither a close nor direct relationship with the individual.  The job of the government is to govern and,
    in the course of doing so, to make broad-based policy decisions for the benefit
    of the public collectively, even if those decisions may not have positive
    implications for all individuals.  It
    would severely curtail the government’s ability to govern if it were found to
    have the necessary direct and close relationship to an individual member of the
    public to support a claim in tort for bad government policy decisions.  It is accepted that, if the government fails
    to make good decisions in these areas, the public will demonstrate its
    displeasure at election time.  Thus, the
    law is clear that the government does not have a proximate relationship to an
    individual Canadian when it makes decisions of a political, social or economic
    nature:  see <i>A.O. Farms Inc. v. Canada</i>, [2000] F.C.J. No. 1771 (T.D.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, once the government has direct communication
    or interaction with the individual in the operation or implementation of a
    policy, a duty of care may arise, particularly where the safety of the
    individual is at risk.  If, for example,
    a government decides to issue a warning about a specific danger, in this case
    medical devices, or to make representations about the safety of a product, the
    government may be liable for the manner in which it issues that warning, or the
    content of those representations, especially where the government disseminates
    the warning or representation knowing that the individual consumer will rely on
    its contents and the individual does so.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For example, Goudge J.A. found that a proximate
    relationship was pleaded in <i>Sauer</i> on
    the basis of <span lang=EN style='color:black;'>specific public representations made by
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    that it was acting to
    protect the interests of the commercial cattle farmers.  The Supreme Court in </span><i>Finney</i> also found a duty of care where a
    clearly identifiable complainant directly interacted with the Barreau in the
    context of its professional complaints process.  Accordingly, a duty of care can be assumed and evidenced by the
    interaction between the parties, depending on the closeness of the relationship.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In my view, there is no allegation of such
    representations by Health Canada in this case that are capable of supporting a
    relationship of proximity.  Accepting the
    pleading that Health Canada knew the implants were dangerous for all consumers,
    knowledge alone is insufficient to found a private law duty of care.  In this case, it is not pleaded that Health
    Canada knew, or ought to have known, that the appellants - as opposed to
    unknown members of the general public - were relying on it to ensure product safety:  see <i><span
lang=EN>Rivtow Marine Ltd. v. Washington Iron Works</span></i><span lang=EN> [1974] S.C.R. 1189 at 1196-7</span>.  I<span lang=EN>n other words, a relationship of proximity is still necessary
    to support a duty of care.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Apart from a bald pleading that the appellants
    relied on Health Canada for the safety of the breast implants, no facts are
    pled to support any reliance.  Moreover,
    there is no suggestion of any direct reliance.  Even if the appellants could be said to have placed general reliance on
    Health
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    based on its role as regulator, that reliance was not evidenced by any pleaded communication
    and was not pled to be within the reasonable expectations of the parties.  Health Canada provided no direct service to
    the appellants and had no contact with them.  This lack of a relationship is evident from the fact that Health Canada did
    not keep, and was not mandated to keep, any record of individuals who received
    implants.  It had no mechanism to notify such
    individuals about product defects or recalls.  Those responsibilities were placed on the manufacturer.  Moreover, the fact that Health Canada’s only
    method of notification to the public would be by public notice supports the
    conclusion that the duty was public, rather than private, in nature.  In addition, as I have observed, the statutory
    framework included no complaints mechanism such as those often provided for
    professional regulatory bodies.  Thus,
    the appellants never raised and had no procedure for registering a complaint with
    Health Canada.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In this case, the legislation put the duty on
    the medical device industry to ensure the safety of its products, to track
    product complaints, to recall dangerous products, and to warn consumers.  Moreover, there was no interaction with
    Health
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    that could
    have led the appellants to believe Health
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    had assumed a private law
    duty of care for product safety.  Nothing
    in the relationship between the parties would lead an individual to assume a
    government product guarantee.  Rather,
    the appellants’ expectations and reliance would have been on their medical
    advisors, the hospital, the manufacturer and the distributor of the device.  I would conclude that the pleaded facts in
    this case do not support a finding of proximity through interaction.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, in this case, Health Canada’s 2007
    website was referenced in the appellants’ factum.  However, the appellants did not refer to the
    website in their pleadings or allege reliance on that website.  Nor could they since the relationship is
    assessed at the earlier time of the alleged tortious conduct.  Accordingly, the website interaction is
    irrelevant to this case.<i></i></p>
      <h3><i>Conclusion on proximity</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This is not a case where Health
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    is
    alleged to have provided a direct misrepresentation or performance assurance to
    the individual consumers regarding the present and long-term safety of the
    medical device.  Rather, this is a case
    where Health Canada acted within its mandate in exercising its discretion
    regarding the enforcement of its regulatory regime.  It had no interaction with the appellants in
    the course of that role.  In those
    circumstances, in my view, the motion judge correctly concluded that it was
    plain and obvious that the appellants failed to frame a cause of action capable
    of establishing proximity.  I observe
    that there was no suggestion that further amendments to the claim could correct
    the deficiency.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US>(d)       Have
    the appellants satisfied stage two of the analysis?</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If I am wrong about the absence of a proximate
    relationship, I would find that the imposition of a duty of care is negatived
    in any event under the second stage of the <i>Anns</i> test by residual policy considerations reflecting the broad societal and legal
    implications of imposing a duty of care: see <i>Cooper</i> at para. 37 and
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <i>Holland</i> at
    para. 10.  The relevant policy
    considerations include the spectre of indeterminate liability, the chilling
    effect of the imposition of a duty of care in the public health context and the
    distinction between policy and operational conduct.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I turn first to consider the spectre of indeterminate
    liability.  Indeterminate liability, in
    my view, is the most relevant policy consideration because the imposition of a
    duty of care in this case may result in the government becoming the virtual
    insurer of medical devices.  The
    appellants argue that indeterminate liability is not a concern because the
    number of affected consumers in this proceeding is relatively contained.  However, Health Canada’s responsibilities
    extend far beyond the regulation of the specific devices at issue in this case to
    the regulation of thousands of other devices.  In addition, potential liability could extend from medical devices to
    other products regulated under the <i>FDA</i>,
    such as food, drugs and cosmetics, as well as to many other regulatory
    regimes.  It follows that the imposition
    of liability on the public purse would place an indeterminate strain on
    available resources.  Accordingly, in my
    view, the prospect of indeterminate liability weighs against the imposition of
    liability in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A second, residual policy consideration is the
    potential chilling effect on public health if Health Canada is held to owe a private
    law duty of care to the individual consumer.  In making decisions about whether medical devices should be available in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    , Health
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    must weigh
    the need of some individuals to obtain relief from suffering (and sometimes
    death), despite the risks of a particular device, with the desire of others to
    avoid all risk, no matter the consequences.  In doing so, Health Canada is obliged to consider the needs of the
    public at large in determining whether a device meets the minimum requirements
    for sale and/or distribution in Canada.  Health Canada argues that the imposition of liability would distract it
    from its predominant mandate of establishing public health priorities.  If liability is imposed, it argues, Health
    Canada may be inclined to limit the number of devices available for the
    consuming public in order to ensure the absolute safety of all potential
    individual consumers and protect itself from liability.  Such a result could frustrate access to
    medical treatment for those who choose to assume the risk of a particular
    medical treatment.  In addition, the
    imposition of liability could also discourage medical advances and innovative
    technologies, which often come with risks and without guarantees regarding
    their long-term consequences.  This
    result would be contrary to public health principles and detrimental to the
    collective public interest.  This
    argument is persuasive; however, in my view, it is weakened by the absence of
    information at this stage of the proceeding about any balancing of public
    health interests that was undertaken by the government in the pleaded
    circumstances of this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, I turn to the distinction between
    government policy and the execution or operation of that policy.  <span lang=EN-US style='color:black;'>It is
    often difficult to distinguish between the two. That is so in this case. The
    impugned conduct could possibly be characterized as either policy or
    operational conduct.  At this early stage
    of the proceeding, when the only allegations are those contained in the
    statement of claim, it is unclear which is the more accurate characterization.  However, in my view, it is unnecessary to make
    a final determination on this issue to reach a conclusion regarding the second
    stage policy considerations.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Particularly, in light of the spectre of indeterminate
    liability, in my view, the second stage policy considerations negative the
    imposition of government liability. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I conclude by observing that, if regulatory bodies are
    held liable in negligence, and are required to pay the complainant’s damages,
    this could lead to decreased vigilance by the regulated entity, in this case
    the manufacturer, importer, and distributor of the product.  Diminished deterrence for a regulated
    industry is to be avoided particularly when it is the industry, and not the
    regulator, that holds critical knowledge regarding product safety.  Yet, as governments increase their regulatory
    functions, they may increasingly be seen as providing a service to members of
    the public upon which individuals may reasonably rely.  This will particularly be the case if
    individuals are given governmental assurance, through websites, representations
    or otherwise, about matters such as the safety of products.  In those circumstances, providing the government
    with immunity for regulatory negligence may be seen to act as a disincentive for
    responsible regulation of industry compliance.  While the circumstances of this case do not
    directly raise these considerations, absent clear legislative guidance from Parliament,
    it may be necessary to address them in the appropriate case. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The costs
    appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants appeal the costs disposition of $125,000,
    arguing that the award was excessive in the circumstances, including the
    divided success below, the novelty of the claim and the claim’s public interest
    nature.  They also argue that the costs
    consequences should reflect the timing of the motion to strike.  On this point, I would accept the submission
    of counsel for the respondents that the inclusion of the motion to strike in
    the certification motion was made at the direction of the class proceedings
    judge.  Regarding quantum, while by no
    means determinative, I observe that the costs award, while high, was made in
    the context of a costs claim by the respondents for <span style='font-size:
12.0pt;'>$1,074,448.20</span>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In making his
    costs disposition, the motion judge was alive to and properly applied
    the relevant principles set out by Rosenberg J.A., for this court, in <i>Pearson
    v. Inco Ltd.</i> (2006), <span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New \(W1\)&quot;;
'>79 O.R. (3d) 427</span> at para. 13 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  In my view, it was open to the motion
    judge to conclude that the proceeding was not in the public interest and did
    not raise issues of such a novel nature as to justify a different costs
    disposition.  Since the appellants have
    failed to persuade me of any error in principle in the motion judge’s costs determination,
    I would not interfere with his exercise of discretion.  I would dismiss the appellants’ costs appeal.</p>

    which they could save their claim, and their reply has already served as an
