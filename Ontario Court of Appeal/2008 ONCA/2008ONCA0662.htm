style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant seeks to set aside the summary
    judgment granted in favour of her former husband, the respondent Keiper, on
    four grounds.  She submits that the
    motion judge erred by:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>granting summary judgment when he knew that the
    appellant’s refusals motion, which could have led to the discovery of evidence
    supportive of the appellant’s assertions of material non-disclosure by Keiper,
    was outstanding;</p>

    appellant’s pleading;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>concluding that there was no genuine issue for
    trial; and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>iv)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>dismissing the appellant’s claim for spousal
    support.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>We reject these submissions for the
    following reasons.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motion judge held that the appellant failed
    to adduce sufficient evidence on the summary judgment motion to support her
    claim that Keiper had failed to discharge his financial disclosure obligations
    when the parties’ separation agreement was entered into.  The motion judge examined, in detail, the
    items of material non-disclosure asserted by the appellant and concluded, in
    each instance, that disclosure had been made and that further disclosure was
    available to the appellant prior to entering into the separation agreement, had
    she wished to pursue it.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We agree.  The record indicates that before entering into the separation agreement,
    the appellant had the benefit of a <i>consent</i> court order that obliged Keiper to make full and complete financial
    disclosure.  Notwithstanding the
    existence of that order, and the identification by the appellant’s own expert
    of the outstanding information needed to fully understand Keiper’s financial
    circumstances, the appellant elected: (i) not to pursue further disclosure by
    Keiper, (ii) to herself propose terms of settlement; and (iii) ultimately, to
    enter into a final settlement in accordance with the terms of a formal
    separation agreement.  The appellant made
    these choices with the benefit of independent legal advice.  Although she now challenges the nature and
    adequacy of that advice, the fact remains that, as between the appellant and
    Keiper, the appellant decided not to pursue further disclosure.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Contrary to the appellant’s submission, nothing
    in s. 56 of the <i>Family Law Act</i> R.S.O.
    1990, c. F.3 precludes a litigant from entering into a final and binding
    settlement in the circumstances above-described, <i>i.e.</i> where financial disclosure is provided.  Having chosen to do so without seeking to
    compel further financial disclosure from Keiper, the appellant could not resile
    from the consequences of that decision unless she demonstrated that Keiper’s
    financial disclosure was inaccurate, misleading or false.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>But the appellant led no evidence on the summary
    judgment motion establishing that the information disclosed by Keiper was so
    deficient.  Instead, she essentially maintained
    that evidence of material non-disclosure by Keiper might be forthcoming during
    his continued discovery and after the appellant’s pending refusals motion was
    adjudicated.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Yet, notwithstanding this contention, the
    appellant agreed to proceed with the summary judgment motion before the argument
    of her refusals motion.  She did not seek
    an adjournment of the summary judgment motion nor, it appears, did she argue
    that the determination of the summary judgment motion was premature or
    prejudicial given the outstanding refusals motion.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In any event, the appellant’s suggestion that
    the refusals motion and the continued discovery of Keiper could have yielded
    evidence of material non-disclosure is, at best, speculative.  For example, the appellant was unable to
    point to any question on the refusals motion that, if answered, would have
    provided evidence of material financial non-disclosure by Keiper.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>  In these
    circumstances, we agree with the motion judge that the appellant failed to meet
    the requisite test to defeat summary judgment.  On this evidentiary record, there is no genuine issue for trial
    regarding the adequacy of Keiper’s financial disclosure.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We also reject the appellant’s claim that the
    motion judge erred by failing to permit her requested pleading amendments.  The motion judge’s reasons indicate that, in
    determining the summary judgment motion, he proceeded on the assumption that
    the requested amendments had been made.  He
    thus took the appellant’s pleaded case ‘at its highest’ when assessing whether
    there was a genuine issue for trial.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Two further observations are appropriate.  First, under the settlement effected by the
    separation agreement, the appellant received the equivalent of a net $10
    million equalization payment, in consideration for which she waived any right
    to spousal support.  In her action, she does
    not challenge the validity of s. 16.10 of the separation agreement.  That provision consists of acknowledgements
    by the parties that each had disclosed to the other his or her income, assets
    and liabilities at the date of separation as well as “more current
    information”, that each was “satisfied with the information provided”, and that
    neither had any outstanding requests for information from the other.  By agreeing to s.&nbsp;16.10 of the
    separation agreement, the appellant confirmed that her waiver of spousal
    support was an informed decision.  Moreover, when cross-examined on her affidavit materials for the purpose
    of the summary judgment motion, the appellant testified that she had placed no
    reliance on the financial information disclosed by Keiper when deciding to
    settle her claims against him. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second, this is a case where the appellant
    acknowledged under oath that she does not know whether she was underpaid or
    overpaid by Keiper.  She does not allege
    that she suffered any loss or damage, or that the settlement entered into under
    the separation agreement was improvident or unconscionable.  In effect, the appellant simply wishes to
    revisit the entire issue of Keiper’s finances in the hope that evidence will
    come to light indicating that he failed to disclose significant income, assets
    or their values when the separation agreement was entered into.  We agree with the motion judge that, having
    previously eschewed her court-sanctioned right to insist on further disclosure
    from Keiper, and having accepted the benefit of the separation agreement, this
    course of action is now foreclosed to the appellant.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appeal is dismissed.  Keiper is entitled to his costs of the appeal
    on the partial indemnity scale.  The
    parties have agreed that the successful party on appeal should be awarded costs
    of $50,000, inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T., and we so order.</p>
