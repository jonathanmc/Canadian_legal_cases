    had an interest in training young elite athletes.  It arose from the help he gave his son who
    obtained a hockey scholarship at an American university.  He began a sideline business in the
    area.  For a lengthy period while
    employed by the Bank, Mr. Clark considered leaving the brokerage business and
    pursuing his athletic training business on a fulltime basis.  He spoke with Ian Leith, a fellow investment
    advisor, about the possibility of selling him his book of business.  He had similar discussions with Felice
    Bontempo, his branch manager.  Both
    expressed an interest in buying Mr. Clark’s book but the discussions had not
    reached the point of a concluded agreement at the time Mr. Clark was dismissed.</p>

    3 or 4, 2004, Mr. Clark was charged with sexually assaulting his common law
    partner.  </span></span>This accelerated his
    discussions with Messrs. Leith and Bontempo about selling his book of business.  Eventually, Mr. Clark agreed with Mr. Leith that
    at some point in the future, they would enter into an agreement to have Mr. Clark’s
    book of business transferred to Mr. Leith.  The trigger for such a development might have been the criminal charges
    proceeding to trial or a decision by Mr. Clark to leave the Bank, whether to pursue
    his own business or for some other reason.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
class=Prompt><span style='color:windowtext'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span class=Prompt><span
style='color:windowtext'>The trial judge began by setting out the factual
    background.  He noted that at the time of
    his dismissal, Mr. Clark had not entered into an agreement to sell his book and
    “transition” the Bank clients he served to any other investment advisor.  However, he found that if the Bank had given Mr.
    Clark time, Mr. Clark would have made an agreement to transfer his book to
    another investment advisor.  He also
    found that there were no proper grounds on which management approval of such an
    agreement could have been denied.  He placed
    a value of $90,000 on Mr. Clark’s lost opportunity to sell his book of
    business.  </span></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
class=Prompt><span style='color:windowtext'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span class=Prompt><span
style='color:windowtext'>The trial judge next considered the issue of
    mitigation.  He began by noting that the
    onus was on the Bank to prove a failure to mitigate.  He found that no brokerage firm would have hired
    Mr. Clark while his criminal charges were outstanding.  He concluded that since Mr. Clark must be
    presumed innocent of the charges at the time of dismissal, he could not be held
    responsible for the negative effect the charges had on his ability to secure
    comparable employment as an investment advisor.  </span></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
class=Prompt><span style='color:windowtext'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span class=Prompt><span
style='color:windowtext'>The trial judge found that it was rational for Mr. Clark
    to develop his athletic training business “in which he had some experience and
    interest.”  He further found that by the
    time the charges were resolved, there was no possibility of his returning to
    the brokerage field as a person with an existing book of business - his book had
    been retained by the Bank, in the hands of Mr. Bontempo.  Given Mr. Clark’s age, it would not have been
    viable for him to attempt to start anew as an investment advisor.  </span></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
class=Prompt><span style='color:windowtext'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span class=Prompt><span
style='color:windowtext'>After noting that the dismissal without cause had
    created many problems for Mr. Clark, and that there was no evidence of any
    realistic chance he might have had to substantially mitigate his loss, he found
    that Mr. Clark’s best chance was to develop his athletic training business and
    that Mr. Clark’s efforts in that regard had been reasonable.    </span></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
class=Prompt><span style='color:windowtext'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span class=Prompt><span
style='color:windowtext'>Thereafter, the trial judge considered the claim for <i>Wallace</i> damages.  He began by stating, “While there were some
    difficulties with the severance interview, the main issue in this regard is the
    refusal to allow Mr. Clark to sell his Book.”  He found that there was no justification for not allowing Mr. Clark to
    attempt to sell his book and that a sale would almost certainly have been
    accomplished within a reasonable period of time had he been permitted to stay.</span></span></p>

    judge set out a number of factors which led to his conclusion that <i>Wallace </i>damages were justified.  Paragraph 28 reads as follows:</span></span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=Prompt><span
style='color:windowtext'>There are a number of factors which lead me to the
    conclusion that a Wallace award is justified.  I am satisfied that Mr. Lessard dealt with Mr. Clark in a cold and
    impersonal manner and his comment that Mr. Clark was not suited for the
    business was calculated to hurt considering Mr. Clark’s 17 years of
    employment.  Mr. Lessard’s refusal to countenance
    Mr. Clark’s transfer of his Book resulted in a windfall for Mr. Bontempo
    considering the advantageous price.  The
    retention of the Book in Mr. Lessard’s branch also had the affect of
    protecting, if not increasing Mr. Lessard’s own participation in its
    proceeds.  Mr. Clark could easily have
    been afforded working notice so that he could have completed the transfer of
    his Book and this is a factor for me to consider (see <i>Chan v. RBC Dominion</i> <i>Securities</i> [2004] O.J. No. 5340).  I am mindful that
    Mr. Lessard sold the Book for $50,000 having expressed the view to Mr. Clark
    that it was worth only $30,000 - $35,000 at the time of the dismissal.  It is my view that these factors taken
    together amount to a violation of the implicit covenant of fair dealing.  I therefore award Wallace damages calculated
    at three month’s notice.  </span></span></p>

    worked prior to dismissal (i.e. January to April), Mr. Clark’s income was
    $47,505.45.  The trial judge noted that on
    an annualised basis, this indicated that Mr. Clark would have earned $150,000
    in gross commissions in 2004.  However,
    after allowing for possible seasonal fluctuations in the receipt of
    commissions, the trial judge arrived at an estimate of $100,000 in gross annual
    commissions.  </span></span></p>

    for income tax purposes he deducted the payments he made to Mr. Davis from his

    taxable income, that does not mean that the trial judge was obliged to treat

    employment, Mr. Clark remained personally obliged to honour his contractual obligations
    to Mr. Davis.  There is nothing in the
    record to suggest that at the time of trial Mr. Clark no longer bore such an obligation.  Accordingly, it was open to the trial judge

    commissions, as Mr. Clark’s was, it can be challenging to make that
    determination.  Although not stated
    explicitly, it is clear from the reasons as a whole that the trial judge
    accepted that Mr. Clark’s annual income had been increasing in the years
    leading up to dismissal, that it was likely to continue at the increased or a
    higher level and that he viewed the commissions Mr. Clark earned in the first
    trimester of 2004 to be the best indication of what his earnings would have

    the negative effect the charges had on his ability to secure comparable
    employment as an investment advisor.  </span></span>In
    addition to finding that the criminal charges prevented Mr. Clark from
    obtaining a position as an investment advisor after dismissal, the trial judge

    presumption in this manner.  It argues
    that Mr. Clark waived the presumption of innocence when, during the notice
    period, he pleaded guilty to the offences of criminal harassment and breach of

    argues, the trial judge was in error to apply the presumption of innocence as
    he did.  Further, the </span></span>Bank <span

    criminal conduct in assaulting his common law spouse that led to his inability

    submission that the trial judge erred in his application of the presumption of
    innocence:  <i>R. v. Moser</i> (2002), 163 C.C.C. (3d) 286 (S.C.), at para. 34, and <i>R. v. Hoang</i> (2003), 182 C.C.C. (3d) 69 (

    constituting an admission of guilt with the result that the presumption of
    innocence is gone.  There can be no
    quarrel with that principle.  However, neither
    case suggests that entering a guilty plea operates retroactively so as to negate
    the presumption of innocence right from the time that a criminal charge is laid.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the present case, once the trial judge determined
    that Mr. Clark had been wrongfully dismissed, he was required to determine the
    reasonable notice period.  At the time of
    dismissal, Mr. Clark had been charged with a criminal offence.  He had not been convicted of any offence.  The fact that Mr. Clark later pleaded guilty
    does not change the fact that at the time of dismissal, the presumption of
    innocence applied.  Accordingly, I reject

    [1987] O.J. No. 1227 (H.C.J.), aff’d [1989] O.J. No. 663 (C.A.), in making its second
    argument on the issue of mitigation.  To
    reiterate, this argument is that <span class=Prompt><span style='color:windowtext'>it
    was Mr. Clark’s own criminal conduct that led to his inability to obtain
    alternative employment as an investment advisor and, in law, that amounts to a
    failure on Mr. Clark’s part to satisfy his duty to mitigate.   </span></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Queensbury</i>,
    the plaintiff corporation contracted to provide the defendant with financial
    planning and consulting services.  The
    defendant terminated the agreement unilaterally and the plaintiff sued for
    wrongful termination.  The plaintiff
    corporation’s sole principal and shareholder was Hugh McLelland.  Before the defendant terminated the
    agreement, Mr. McLelland was charged and convicted of criminal offences.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Queensbury</i>,
    Catzman J. found that an employment relationship existed between the parties
    and that the plaintiff was entitled to reasonable notice of five months.  When dealing with the matter of mitigation,
    he found that had Mr. McLelland made “greater and more efforts” to find
    comparable employment and had he not been burdened in seeking such employment
    by the criminal conviction, he would have found employment within three months
    of the date of termination.  Accordingly,
    he reduced the notice period to three months.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not accept the Bank’s contention that because Mr.
    Clark was ultimately convicted of a criminal offence, his inability to find
    comparable employment necessarily means he failed in his duty to mitigate nor
    do I accept that <i>Queensbury </i>dictates
    such a result.  The facts in the present
    case are materially different from those in <i>Queensbury</i>.  In the latter, at the time of termination Mr.
    McLelland had been convicted of a criminal offence.  As has already been noted, at the time Mr.
    Clark’s employment was terminated, he had only been charged with a criminal
    offence and the presumption of innocence applied.  Moreover, unlike <i>Queensbury</i>, in the present case the trial judge made no finding
    that Mr. Clark had failed to make reasonable efforts to find alternate
    employment.  While an argument could be
    made that Mr. Clark’s inability to obtain employment after the conviction was
    due to his own conduct, such an argument cannot succeed in light of the trial
    judge’s finding that by the time the conviction was entered, Mr. Clark would
    have been unable to take up a position as an investment advisor because his
    book of business had been retained by the Bank and, given his age, it was not
    viable for Mr. Clark to start afresh in such a position.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Evans v.
    Teamsters Local Union No. 31 </i>(2008), S.C.C. 20, the Supreme Court of Canada
    recently reviewed the principles that govern mitigation.  Justice Bastarache, writing for the majority,
    reiterated that where reasonable notice has not been given, the employer is
    required to pay damages in lieu of notice but that requirement is subject to
    the employee’s obligation to make reasonable efforts to mitigate damages by
    seeking an alternate source of income (para. 28).  He also reiterated that the employer bears the
    onus of demonstrating both that the employee failed to make such reasonable
    efforts to find work and that work could have been found (para. 30).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although <i>Evans </i>was
    decided after the trial decision was handed down, it can be seen that the
    reasoning of the trial judge is consistent with these principles.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The reasons of the trial judge for finding that Mr.
    Clark had made reasonable efforts to mitigate have already been set out.  As previously discussed, the trial judge
    found that Mr. Clark could not have found work as an investment advisor at the
    time of dismissal because of the criminal charges.  By the time the charges were resolved, there
    would have been no possibility of Mr. Clark returning to the brokerage business
    as a person with an existing book.  Mr.
    Clark’s book had been retained by Mr. Bontempo and/or his clients might have
    moved in the meantime. Mr. Clark would have been starting anew and given his
    age, that was not a viable option.  In
    the circumstances, there is no basis on which to take issue with the trial
    judge’s finding that Mr. Clark’s decision to develop his athletic training business
    was rational or his determination that Mr. Clark took reasonable steps to
    mitigate.      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore and in any event, the trial judge expressly
    found that there was no evidence of any realistic chance that Mr. Clark might
    have secured alternative employment.  Thus,
    the Bank failed to discharge its burden of demonstrating that Mr. Clark could
    have found work.  As <i>Evans </i>makes clear, the Bank bore not only the burden of
    demonstrating that Mr. Clark failed to make reasonable efforts to find
    comparable work but also that such work could have been found.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I see no basis on which to interfere with

    ),
    at pp. 268-69, leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, (1989), 69 O.R. (2d) xi; <i>Perez (Litigation Guardian of) v. Salvation

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, although it would have been preferable had the
    amended statement of claim made clear that damages for lost opportunity were
    sought as part of its claim for compensation for a failure to give reasonable
    notice, it is worthy of note that 24 months’ damages were sought in the
    statement of claim and the prayer for relief seeks $300,000 as damages for such
    a claim.  While not explicit, given that
    the Bank viewed Mr. Clark as earning less than $100,000 annually, this suggests
    a claim for something in addition to lost commissions.  Finally, I see no evidence of prejudice to
    the Bank given that the claim for such damages was fully argued below.  If the Bank felt it was prejudiced by such an
    argument, the time to raise it was at trial when the evidence was called and
    the argument on point was made.  At that time,
    the trial judge could have decided whether to allow an amendment to the
    pleadings.  In that regard, it is useful
    to recall that pursuant to rule 26.01 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, on
    motion at any stage of an action, the court <i>shall </i>grant leave to amend, absent prejudice that is not compensable by costs or
    an adjournment.<i> </i>     </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US>Compensation for his Book of Business </span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
class=Prompt><span style='color:windowtext'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span class=Prompt><span
style='color:windowtext'>At the time of Mr. Clark’s dismissal, the Bank had a
    policy that set out when and how an investment advisor who was leaving the
    brokerage business might “transition” management of his or her Bank client
    assets to another investment advisor.  The
    transition policy stipulated that the departing investment advisor had to have
    an agreement to transition the client assets to a successor investment advisor and
    that the agreement had to have Bank approval.  The policy set out minimum eligibility criteria and stated that the Bank
    had the discretion to determine that an investment advisor was not eligible to
    participate in a transition agreement, even in circumstances where the
    eligibility criteria appeared to be met.  If Bank approval was obtained, the policy required that the Bank be made
    a party to the agreement and that all payments under the agreement were to be through
    the Bank’s payroll system.</span></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Bank submits that, in light of the policy, <span
class=Prompt><span style='color:windowtext'>Mr. Clark had no contractual right
    to enter into an agreement to sell his book of business.  Accordingly, it argues, the proceeds of such
    an agreement are not a benefit provided by Mr. Clark’s employment contract that
    was lost by reason of the Bank’s failure to provide Mr. Clark with reasonable
    notice of termination and he cannot recover damages for them.  </span></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not accept this submission.  The fact that Mr. Clark did not have a contractual
    right to sell his book of business at the time his employment was terminated is
    not determinative of the matter, in my view.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once the trial judge found that Mr. Clark had been
    wrongfully dismissed, his task was to determine what damage award would put Mr.
    Clark in the same position he would have been in had he received reasonable
    notice of termination.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
class=Prompt><span style='color:windowtext'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>The trial judge considered the evidence and
    concluded it was reasonably probable that Mr. Clark would have sold his book to
    Mr. Leith or Mr. Bontempo had he been given the time in which to do so.  He was also satisfied that there were no
    proper grounds on which Bank approval could have been withheld.  Finally, he was satisfied that a reasonable
    price for the sale of the book would have been reached.  Consequently, it was open to the trial judge
    to find, as he did, that the Bank’s <span class=Prompt><span style='color:windowtext'>failure
    to provide Mr. Clark with reasonable notice of termination caused him to lose the
    opportunity to sell his book of business, a benefit that he would have had during
    the notice period.  </span></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This principle underpins the award of damages for
    losses in addition to lost income in other instances.  So, for example, in <i>Veer v. Dover</i> (1999), 120 O.A.C. 394, this court ratified the award
    of damages for unexercised options under a stock option agreement which were
    found to be available during the notice period, despite a clause in the
    agreement which provided that the option would be cancelled on termination of
    employment.  Similarly, in <i>Taggart v. Canada Life</i> (2005), 39
    C.C.E.L. (3d) 48 (S.C.), aff’d (2006), 50 C.C.P.B. 163 (
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), damages
    were awarded for the loss of value that would have been added to the employee’s
    pension had he worked through the notice period.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=Prompt><span style='color:windowtext'>Accordingly,
    I see no error in the award of damages for lost opportunity.</span></span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span
lang=EN-US>WALLACE </span></i><span lang=EN-US>DAMAGES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Bank made a number of arguments as to why it was an
    error for the trial judge to have made an award of <i>Wallace </i>damages.  Some of its
    arguments are based on the <i>Wallace </i>decision.  Others are based on <i>Honda Canada Inc. v. Keays</i>, 2008 SCC 39, a recent Supreme Court of
    Canada decision which, the Bank submits, materially changed the law on <i>Wallace </i>damages.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I will not recount the various arguments as, in my
    view, the award of <i>Wallace </i>damages
    must be set aside for one simple reason: in the circumstances of this case, it amounted
    to double recovery for Mr. Clark.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As has already been discussed, the trial judge awarded
    Mr. Clark damages of $90,000 as compensation for loss of the opportunity to
    sell his book of business.  It will be
    recalled that the trial judge made the award of damages because of the Bank’s
    refusal to permit Mr. Clark to sell his book of business.  In so doing, he compensated Mr. Clark twice
    for the same thing.  Compensation for the
    lost opportunity having been properly made as part of the damage award for
    failure to give reasonable notice, it was not correct to award compensation for
    it again by way of a <i>Wallace </i>award.   </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>DISPOSITION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I would allow the appeal in part by
    setting aside paragraph 2 of the Judgment, that being the award of <i>Wallace</i> damages.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the appellant succeeded in part, the respondent
    was successful in defending against the majority of the matters in dispute on
    appeal.  In the circumstances, I would make
    no order as to costs of the appeal.  I
    would not disturb the costs order below.  </p>
