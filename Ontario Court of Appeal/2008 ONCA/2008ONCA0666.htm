    contrary to s. 246(3) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>.  He was given an effective
    sentence of 17 months incarceration, comprised of 75 days of pre-sentence custody
    credited on a 2:1 basis and a further 12 months in jail.  In addition, he was sentenced to 3 years of
    probation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sole issue raised on appeal is whether the sentence
    is excessive.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><u><span lang=EN-US>Facts</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant and Rita Dextras were married for
    approximately 15 years. They had been separated for 3 years prior to the
    incident in question.  They had a
    daughter and a son, Robert.  Robert had
    multiple disabilities including a seizure disorder; he died in March 2008 while
    the appellant was in pre-sentence custody.  Ms. Dextras has another daughter from a previous marriage.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant had been convicted of two previous
    assaults against Ms. Dextras prior to the incident giving rise to his
    harassment conviction. One of these incidents occurred in 1992 and the other in
    2005.  During the 2005 assault, he held
    Ms. Dextras to the ground with a hatchet over her head.  He pleaded guilty to the offence of assault
    and served 14 days of pre-sentence custody and a further 4 days in jail for
    this offence.  One month later, he failed
    to comply with the conditions of release and was arrested again and given a
    suspended sentence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On November 30, 2007, the appellant went to Ms.
    Dextras’ home where she lived with the children.  Ms. Dextras called the police and they warned
    him to not contact his wife or children.  Despite that warning, the appellant called Ms. Dextras on a number of
    occasions.  On one occasion she took the
    call and told the appellant he was not to call.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On February 17, 2008, the appellant appeared at Ms.
    Dextras’ front door.  He knocked and said
    he wanted to see the children.  When she
    saw who it was, Ms. Dextras locked the door and called the police.  She was terrified and so too were her
    children.  All three children and her
    eldest daughter’s boyfriend cowered in the home, armed themselves and called
    911.  They took Robert to the basement. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Dextras and the children were extremely fearful and
    unsure of what the appellant would do.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the police arrived, the appellant was on the
    street.  He was agitated, saying he
    wanted to see the children.  Police
    warned the appellant to not go back to the house whereupon he went straight
    back to the front door of Ms. Dextras’ home.  He was then arrested and charged with criminal harassment. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><u><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is trite law that this court owes considerable
    deference to the sentence as imposed by the sentencing judge.  It is not to be interfered with unless the
    sentencing judge has committed an error in principle, failed to consider a
    relevant factor, placed an inappropriate emphasis on a factor or where it is
    demonstrably unfit.  In our view, the
    sentencing judge committed no such error.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing judge considered the totality of the
    circumstances and his reasons for sentence reflect a considered and balanced
    approach. He took into account the mitigating factors which include the guilty
    plea, the death of the appellant’s son, the appellant’s successful completion
    of two previous probation periods and the appellant’s medical issues. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing judge set out a number of aggravating
    factors which include a significant history of abuse and two prior convictions
    for assault of the same victim.  He noted
    that on the second assault conviction, the Crown advised the court without
    objection by the defence, that the victim had been held down and threatened
    with a hatchet.  The sentencing judge
    explicitly recognised that the appellant had already been sentenced and
    punished for that prior assault but explained that it went to the victim’s fear
    on the date of the incident in question.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As well, the sentencing judge noted the history of
    abuse to the children and that they were terrified of the appellant to the point
    they armed themselves when he appeared at the door of their home.  The sentencing judge concluded that although
    the appellant had successfully completed two previous periods of probation and
    a men’s anti-violence course, he appeared to have learned nothing.  This conclusion was justified on the
    record.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Other aggravating factors include a previous firearms
    offence, albeit dated, and the fact that the complainant was the appellant’s
    spouse.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no basis on which to interfere with the
    sentence.  Accordingly, leave to appeal
    sentence is granted but the appeal is dismissed.</p>
