  <h2>I.          INTRODUCTION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This appeal, brought on behalf of the Attorney
    General, concerns the conditional sentences imposed upon the respondents,
    Alexander Ryazanov and Wang-Piao Dumani Ross, after each pleaded guilty to the
    charge of dangerous driving causing death. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondents were travelling north on
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Mount Pleasant Road
    in the city of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto
    at excessive rates of speed on a January evening in 2006.  One of their vehicles crashed into Tahir
    Khan, a taxi driver attempting a left hand turn onto
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Whitehall Road.  Mr. Khan died at the scene. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Each respondent was sentenced to serve a
    conditional sentence of two years less a day, followed by two years’ probation,
    plus a concurrent driving prohibition of four years.  In addition to the statutory terms, the
    sentences included a period of house arrest for the first year, followed by a
    curfew for the second year and 150 hours of community service work. The
    appellant has urged this court to overturn the conditional sentences, arguing
    that a period of incarceration was warranted in this case.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For the reasons that follow, I would allow the
    appeal by varying the terms of the conditional sentences to require house
    arrest for both years and to increase the length of the driving prohibition to
    seven years.  </p>
  <h2>II.        BACKGROUND FACTS</h2>
  <h2>(1)       The offences</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The following is a summary of the agreed
    statement of facts that, together with the guilty pleas, supported the
    convictions.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The fatal collision occurred just after 10:00
    p.m. on January 24, 2006.  The
    respondents, each driving Mercedes-Benz automobiles, were on their way to Mr.
    Ryazanov’s house. They chose a route that took them northbound on
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Mount Pleasant Road,
    a major four-lane north-south thoroughfare in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Toronto with numerous curves and grades.  The posted speed limit is 60 kilometres per
    hour.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A number of witnesses observed the respondents
    over a distance of approximately one and a half kilometres as they drove north on
    Mount Pleasant Road from Bloor Street to where the collision took place.  The vehicles were observed travelling at
    estimated speeds varying from 80 to 140 kilometres per hour.  They were described as passing each other, at
    times leaving little space between them.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As the respondents were driving northbound on
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Mount Pleasant, the
    victim was driving southbound.  Mr. Khan
    stopped at the intersection of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Mount Pleasant
    and
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Whitehall
    to turn left.  The intersection is
    controlled by a flashing amber light.  Mr. Khan, moving about 20 kilometres per hour, was part way through the
    turn when Mr. Ryazanov’s car crashed into the right hand side of his taxi.  It was estimated that Mr. Ryazanov was
    travelling at about 119 kilometres per hour at the moment of impact.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The momentum of the impact forced Mr. Khan’s car
    north over the raised concrete curb and left the driver’s side wrapped around a
    utility pole.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Ross had been following right behind Mr.
    Ryazanov.  He manoeuvred his car through
    the cloud of debris and continued northbound for about 700 metres further.  After parking, Mr. Ross, and a friend who was
    travelling with him, walked back to the crash site.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondents were each charged with criminal
    negligence causing death and dangerous driving causing death.  Mr. Ross was also charged with leaving the
    scene of an accident.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Tahir Khan had come to
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto
    from a village in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:country-region>
    to create a better life for his family.  He worked as a taxi driver to support his extended family, who all
    remained in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Pakistan</st1:country-region>
    .  He was hard-working and much loved by his
    family.  Mr. Khan’s death has caused the
    family horrific personal loss.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After arrest, the respondents spent one week in
    jail following which they were released on bail under their parents’
    supervision.  Their bail terms, which included
    a driving prohibition, remained in place until sentencing – a period of 16
    months. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><b><i> </i></b>At
    the time of the accident the respondents were both 18 years old and had just
    completed high school.  Neither had a
    criminal record.  At the time of sentencing,
    both were university students.  Neither
    had a history of drug or alcohol abuse.  Both respondents were supported by stable families, had expressed
    remorse and accepted full responsibility for their actions. </p>
  <h2>(2)       The sentencing</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Each respondent pleaded guilty to dangerous
    driving causing death.  The Crown
    withdrew the other charges. </p>
  <h2><i>(i)        The submissions of
    counsel</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for the respondents argued in favour of
    conditional sentences of two years less a day, plus probation.  The proposed terms of the conditional
    sentences included nine months of house arrest and a driving prohibition of one
    year after the completion of the conditional sentences.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondents submitted that conditional
    sentences were appropriate in light of their guilty pleas and being youthful
    first offenders with positive pre-sentence reports.  The criminal conduct was characterized as a
    “mistaken decision to drive fast.”  It
    was argued that there was no racing - no crazy driving, apart from speed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Crown argued in favour of penitentiary
    sentences of three years and driving prohibitions of significant length.  The Crown asked the court to find that the
    respondents’ conduct was more than just speeding and in fact constituted
    racing.  The Crown described the nature
    of the conduct as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>My friends have said
    there was not racing, but in the agreed statement of fact that was read in, the
    witnesses estimated that, “Two vehicles were travelling at speeds varying from
    80 kilometres an hour to 130, to 140 kilometres an hour.  They were passing cars in the roadway, at the
    time leaving little space between them, veering from a couple of car lengths to
    a few feet.  There were instances where
    they were both in separate lanes going at a high rate of speed.  All witnesses saw the cars for only a few
    seconds at a time.” </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I think it’s just a
    matter of semantics, Your Honour.  That
    is racing in my respectful submission.  It’s more than just speed, and I’d ask Your Honour to accept that.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In consideration of the nature of the conduct
    and its catastrophic consequences, the Crown submitted that the principles of
    denunciation and general deterrence demanded a custodial term.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the alternative, the Crown argued that if
    conditional sentences were imposed, the sentences should include terms
    amounting to house arrest for at least one year, significant community service,
    and a driving prohibition of seven to eight years.</p>
  <h2><i>(ii)       The reasons for
    sentence</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For sentencing purposes, the sentencing judge
    treated the respondents identically in all relevant respects. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The sentencing judge accepted as mitigating the
    respondents’ expressed remorse, their pleas of guilty and their youthful first
    offender status.  He noted their positive
    pre-sentence reports and that there was no suggestion that drugs or alcohol
    were involved.  Further, the media and
    stigma to which each respondent had been subject was regarded as a relevant
    consideration.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The sentencing judge considered the following as
    aggravating factors: the respondents’ conduct resulted in the death of an
    innocent, hard-working family man; the respondents were travelling at speeds of
    more than two times the legal limit on a major Toronto thoroughfare; the nature
    of the driving covered a distance of at least one and a half kilometres; and
    the respondents freely and voluntarily engaged in wrongful conduct with
    absolutely no justification. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The sentencing judge held that it was excessive
    speed and bad judgment that resulted in the death of Mr. Khan.  He stated that the Crown was not relying on
    evidence of racing.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Based upon the case law before him, the
    sentencing judge concluded that there was no set range of sentence for this
    type of offence.  He further concluded
    that the principles of deterrence and denunciation could be addressed within
    the framework of conditional sentences.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondents were each sentenced to serve a
    conditional sentence of two years less a day, on the following terms:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>a.         The
    statutory terms under s. 742.3(1); </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>b.         The
    first 12 months under house arrest, with exceptions for work, school, religious
    observance, and medical and legal appointments; </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>c.         The last 12 months under curfew,
    requiring the respondents to be at home between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m., with
    exceptions for employment, or while in the company of a parent, or with the
    prior written approval of a parent;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>d.         Perform
    150 hours of community service;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>e.         Take
    counselling as required;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>f.          Not
    to drive a motor vehicle.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>Further, two years probation was
    imposed, the main condition being a driving prohibition.  There was also a separate driving prohibition
    order for four years, concurrent to the conditional sentence and probation
    orders.     </p>
  <h2><i>(iii)     The Crown undertaking
    not to appeal</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Attorney General brought this appeal
    notwithstanding that, prior to sentencing, the Crown Attorney’s office
    undertook that an appeal against sentence would not be pursued if conditional
    sentences were to be imposed.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The following is a summary of the agreed
    statement of facts detailing discussions between the Assistant Crown Attorney
    who had carriage of this matter, defence counsel, and the sentencing judge,
    which occurred prior to the guilty pleas.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On March 19, 2007 the respondents attended at
    the Ontario Court of Justice for the start of the preliminary hearing.  Prior to the commencement of the proceedings,
    the Crown and defence counsel discussed the possibility of resolving the matter
    on the basis of guilty pleas to dangerous driving causing death, rather than
    criminal negligence causing death. Crown counsel expressed a willingness to
    consult with Paul Culver, the Crown Attorney for the Region of Toronto, to see
    if he would sanction such a resolution. </p>

    adjourned to the following day.  The
    Crown and counsel for Mr. Ryazanov continued to discuss the possible guilty
    pleas and the corresponding positions with respect to sentence.  The Crown indicated that even if she were
    able to agree to a plea of dangerous driving causing death, she would seek a
    penitentiary term of three years.  Counsel for Mr. Ryazanov made it clear that he would ask for a
    conditional sentence.  In the course of
    this exchange, counsel for Mr. Ryazanov proposed that the matter be pre-tried
    with the judge presiding at the preliminary hearing, who later became the
    sentencing judge.  Counsel for Mr.
    Ryazanov asked the Crown to consider giving an undertaking not to appeal should
    the presiding judge see fit to impose a conditional sentence.   </p>

    judge.  When court commenced, all counsel
    requested that they meet with the preliminary hearing judge in chambers.  During the in-chambers discussions, counsel
    outlined the general facts and their positions as to sentence.  The judge asked if the Crown would appeal a
    conditional sentence should one be imposed. Crown counsel indicated that the
    Crown would not appeal and that Mr. Culver had approved this position.  </p>

  <h2>III.       ISSUES</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Three issues present themselves for
    determination.  The first issue, raised
    by the respondents, concerns the effect of the Crown undertaking:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(1)       Does the Crown undertaking bar this
    appeal?</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'>The second two issues are the grounds of appeal advanced by the
    appellant:  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(2)       Did the sentencing judge err in principle?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(3)       Were the sentences imposed demonstrably
    unfit?</p>
  <h2>IV.       ANALYSIS </h2>
  <h2>(1)       Does the Crown undertaking
    bar this appeal?</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondents contend that the Crown
    undertaking should act as an absolute bar to this appeal and that this court
    should refuse to grant leave.  It is
    argued that to permit the Crown’s repudiation from the express assurance that
    the sentences would not be appealed would amount to an abuse of process in
    violation of s. 7 of the <i>Canadian Charter
    of Rights and Freedoms</i> and would undermine the integrity of the judicial
    pre-trial and resolution process.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant acknowledges that this appeal was
    advanced notwithstanding that, prior to sentencing, the Crown Attorney’s office
    undertook that no appeal would be pursued.  The appellant submits, however, that the undertaking does not preclude
    the Attorney General from appealing.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In my view, the sentence appeal is within the
    Attorney General’s statutory power.  The
    Crown Attorney’s office cannot divest the Attorney General of this power, for
    the following reasons:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(i)        The power of the Attorney General to
    appeal is statutory in nature;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(ii)       Case law establishes that Crown counsel
    cannot divest the Attorney General of this statutory power of appeal; and </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(iii)     The respondents failed to establish that
    granting leave to appeal would amount to an abuse of process in violation of s.
    7 of the <i>Charter</i>.  </p>
  <h2><i>(i)        The power of the Attorney General to appeal is statutory in
    nature</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Attorney General’s power to appeal and seek
    leave to appeal in criminal matters is a right conferred by Parliament under
    the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  The Attorney General’s power to seek leave to
    appeal a sentence in indictable matters is conferred under s. 676(1)(d).  This power is vested in “[t]he Attorney
    General or counsel instructed by him for the purpose”.  Parliament has not vested the Crown’s trial
    counsel with the authority to decide whether or not to appeal, nor has this
    power been delegated by the Attorney General to the Crown’s trial counsel.  The explicit policy of the Ministry of the
    Attorney General delegates the authority to launch appeals in indictable matters
    to only the Director of the Crown Law Office – Criminal, or his/her designate. </p>
  <h2><i>(ii)       Case
    law establishes that Crown counsel cannot divest the Attorney General of this
    statutory power of appeal</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The proposition that the Crown’s trial counsel
    cannot bind the Attorney General’s statutory discretion to appeal was accepted
    by this court in <i>R. v. Dubien </i>(1982),
    67 C.C.C. (2d) 341.  In that case, the
    Crown undertook that if the sentences proposed by the pre-trial judge were
    imposed, the Crown Attorney’s office would not recommend an appeal.  The Crown made it clear that he could not and
    was not purporting to bind the Attorney General on the question of whether an
    appeal from sentence should be taken.  However, the matter came to the Attorney General’s attention
    independently of the Crown Attorney’s office and an appeal against sentence was
    launched.  The respondent argued that the
    Attorney General was “estopped” from appealing due to the Crown’s undertaking.  This court held that Crown counsel could not
    bind the Attorney General’s exercise of authority to decide whether an appeal
    should or should not be taken.  Significantly, the court went on to hold as follows, at p. 346:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Even if [the trial
    Crown] had not “conditioned” his understanding [by the explicit caveat that the
    Attorney General cannot be bound by the trial Crown’s undertaking], counsel for
    the Crown could not take away the discretion vested in the Attorney-General to
    determine whether an appeal should or should not be taken or the obligation
    imposed on this court to consider the fitness of the sentences when the matter
    is before us. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is clear that the relationship between Crown
    Attorneys and the Attorney General differs from the law of agency in other
    contexts where the agent’s acts may bind the principal.  I agree with the comments included in the “Martin
    Report<i>”</i> (<i>Report of the Attorney General’s Advisory Committee on Charge
    Screening, Disclosure, and Resolution Discussions</i>, 1993), at p. 331, that
    the relationship between the Attorney General and his or her agents involves
    more than simple principles of agency:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It involves the
    pre-eminent social value of administering criminal justice in furtherance of
    the public interest, which the Attorney General must accomplish as a matter of
    duty.  Therefore, when principles of
    agency and the public interest in administering criminal justice collide, the
    latter must prevail. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As will become clear later in these reasons, the
    sentences imposed in this case are of a nature such as to require the Attorney
    General, in the discharge of his or her duty, to appeal the sentences to ensure
    that the administration of justice is fairly and properly carried out.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I reject the respondents’ argument that to
    permit the Crown to appeal in these circumstances would lead to a collapse of
    the plea bargaining system.  The same <i>in terrorem</i> argument was advanced and
    rejected by this court in <i>Dubien</i>.  In the 26 years since <i>Dubien </i>was decided, the plea bargaining system has not collapsed
    and judicial pre-trials have continued to be a productive part of the criminal
    trial process.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Further, I note that the Crown Attorneys
    involved did not purport to bind the discretion of the Attorney General.  In this sense, there was no true repudiation
    of a pre-trial agreement. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It may be helpful to make one additional comment
    regarding the Attorney General’s discretion to appeal.  Given that under the current state of the law
    there is no ability to insulate a decision from appellate review, it is unwise
    for either counsel or the trial judge to enter into discussions that
    contemplate an agreement to restrict the appeal rights of either side.  Resolution discussions should focus upon
    resolving matters <i>at the trial level</i> in a manner that is warranted in the particular circumstances.  It is the independent duty of the Attorney
    General to ensure that trial matters have been resolved in a manner that is
    fair and just. </p>
  <h2><i>(iii)     The
    respondents failed to establish that granting leave to appeal would amount to
    an abuse of process in violation of s. 7 of the Charter  </i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondents argue that to allow this appeal
    to proceed would amount to an abuse of process, in violation of s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>.  This argument falls short of establishing a constitutional violation
    sufficient to remove the discretion vested by Parliament in the Attorney
    General to launch an appeal in this case.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Supreme Court of Canada has held that abuse
    of process is found only in the “clearest of cases” where there is
    “overwhelming evidence that the proceedings under scrutiny are unfair to the
    point that they are contrary to the interest of justice”:   see e.g. <i>R.
    v. O’Connor </i>(1995), 103 C.C.C. (3d) 1, at p. 38; <i>R. v. Power </i>(1994), 89 C.C.C. (3d) 1, at p. 10.  In this case, affidavits sworn by each of the
    respondents’ trial counsel were submitted as fresh evidence.  Both state that “[i]n light of Justice
    Moore’s indication that he would impose a conditional sentence and the Crown’s
    assurance that there would be no appeal, my client provided me final instructions
    that he wished to proceed with a plea of guilty to dangerous driving causing
    death.”  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The circumstances here fall far short of
    establishing abuse of process.  First, on
    a fair reading of this record, it is clear that the plea agreement was not
    dependent on the Crown’s undertaking not to appeal if conditional sentences
    were imposed. The affidavits filed by experienced trial counsel for the
    respondents do not suggest that the instructions to plead guilty would not have
    been given but for the Crown’s undertaking.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second, any purported reliance by the
    respondents upon the Crown’s assurance that there would not be an appeal must
    be tempered by the following considerations:  counsel for the respondents knew of the Crown’s position that a
    significant term of incarceration was appropriate in this case; the Crown
    Attorneys involved did not purport to bind the right of the Attorney General to
    appeal the sentences imposed; and it should be assumed that respondents’
    counsel were aware of the power vested by Parliament in the Attorney General
    and of this court’s affirmation of that power in <i>Dubien</i>.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus, while I accept that granting leave to
    appeal could appear unfair, it does not amount to a level of unfairness that is
    contrary to the interests of justice. Granting leave to appeal would not
    violate the conscience of the community:  see <i>R. v. Power</i>, at p.
    10.  On the contrary, as I have
    mentioned, the error in the sentences imposed is of a nature such as to require
    the Attorney General to appeal to ensure that the administration of justice is
    fairly and properly carried out.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Leave to appeal is granted.  The sentence appeal must be considered on its
    merits.</p>
  <h2>(2)       Did the sentencing judge

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Supreme Court of Canada has recently
    affirmed that appellate courts must show considerable deference in reviewing
    decisions of trial judges where appeals against sentence are concerned: see <i>R. v. L.M.</i> (2008), 231 C.C.C. (3d)
    310.  At para. 14, the court stated the
    principle of deference, in reference to <i>R.
    v. M. (

    follows:  (i) the sentencing judge failed
    to properly address the respondents’ sober, conscious choices to drive
    dangerously; and (ii) the sentencing judge failed to properly address racing.</p>

    erred in failing to consider the absence of alcohol as an aggravating
    factor.  In other words, the fact that
    the conduct was soberly contemplated should have been seen as increasing the
    moral culpability of the offenders as much as if alcohol had been
    involved:  see <i>R. v. Burcham</i> (1987), 23 O.A.C. 21, at para. 21.</p>

'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The offender’s mental state is a factor that
    must be considered by the sentencing judge in crafting a fit sentence.  However, I do not accept the appellant’s
    argument that the manner in which the sentencing judge dealt with this issue
    constituted an error in principle.  In
    his reasons, it is clear that he treated the respondents’ sober, conscious
    choice to drive dangerously as aggravating.  It was acknowledged that the dangerous driving was not due to a momentary
    lapse in judgment.  The sentencing judge
    found that there was “absolutely no justification” for the respondents’
    behaviour and further, that they “freely and voluntarily engaged in this
    obviously wrong conduct.”  The weight to
    be attached to this factor was for the sentencing judge to determine.</p>
  <h2><a name="_Toc178047591"><i>(ii)       Did the sentencing judge fail to properly

    erred in principle by failing to consider whether the respondents were racing.  In turn, the appellant argues that the
    sentencing judge erred by failing to find that their conduct amounted to
    racing, which should have been treated as an aggravating factor.  The respondents argue that, although the
    sentencing judge stated that the Crown was not relying on evidence of racing,
    he properly considered the details contained in the agreed statement of facts
    in support of the Crown’s claim of racing.</p>

    evidence set out in the agreed statement of facts in support of the Crown’s
    claim of racing.  Even though the
    sentencing judge mistakenly stated that the Crown was not relying on evidence
    of racing, he nonetheless gave proper consideration to the facts that could
    support the Crown’s contention.  He
    acknowledged that the respondents were travelling at speeds of more than two
    times the legal limit, while switching from one lane to another and that this
    conduct continued over a distance of one and a half kilometres.  I am satisfied that the sentencing judge
    considered the factors that the Crown argued amounted to racing, although in
    his reasons he did not individually list each aspect of the respondents’
    driving behaviour. </p>

    high rate of speed in the same direction.  The agreed statement of facts did not include a statement that the

    each other from passing.  There was no
    mention of abrupt lane changes or bold manoeuvring consistent with racing

    conduct in order to determine the appropriate sentence. I agree with the
    comments at para. 27 in <i>R. v. Khosa </i>(2003),
    180 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (B.C.C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [2004]
    S.C.C.A. No. 38, that “[i]t is more important to focus on the particulars of
    the offence and the offenders rather than to rely simply on the label ‘street
    race’ to determine how to sentence the respondents.”  That is precisely what the sentencing judge
    did in this case.  While he found that
    the cause of the accident was a combination of speed and bad judgment, he also
    acknowledged the features of the respondents’ driving that made it “dangerous”,
    features that were properly acknowledged as aggravating.</p>

  <h2>(3)       Were the sentences imposed

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant submits that, in any event, the
    sentences imposed were demonstrably unfit.  While acknowledging that the sentences are within the established range,
    the appellant argues that the current range is inadequate to address the
    paramount sentencing objectives of denunciation and general deterrence
    appropriate to the circumstances here.  Simply put, in dangerous driving offences causing death, a period of
    incarceration should be the norm.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondents submit that the conditional
    sentences imposed were fit and reasonable.  Further, the respondents argue against the imposition of a judicially
    created presumption against conditional sentences in dangerous driving
    cases.  It is submitted that the offence
    of dangerous driving causing death can occur in such a variety of different
    circumstances that the appropriate sentence can only be determined by examining
    the individual features of each case.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    considering the appellant’s request to re-evaluate the current range for
    dangerous driving causing death cases, I am cognizant of the Supreme Court of
    Canada’s observation in <i>R. v. Proulx </i>(2000),
    140 C.C.C. (3d) 449, at para. 79, that “a conditional sentence is available in
    principle for <i>all</i> offences in which
    the statutory prerequisites are satisfied”, namely (i) there is no minimum term
    of imprisonment; (ii) the appropriate sentence is less than two years; and
    (iii) the safety of the community would not be endangered by the offender
    serving the sentence in the community: see <i>Criminal
    Code </i>at s. 742.1.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In this
    case, each statutory prerequisite is met, and thus a conditional sentence is
    available in principle.  However, this
    conclusion does not end the inquiry.  Where the statutory prerequisites are satisfied, a conditional sentence may
    be imposed only if it is consistent with the fundamental purposes and
    principles of sentencing as set out in s. 718 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Where,
    as here, two young men made a conscious decision to drive in a dangerous
    fashion and caused the death of an innocent member of our community, the
    sentencing objectives of denunciation and general deterrence must be
    paramount.  I agree with the sentencing
    judge’s view that, in this case, these objectives can be addressed within the
    framework of conditional sentences.  However, the problem lies in the conditions of the sentences imposed and
    the length of the driving prohibitions.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The conditions imposed, particularly in the
    second half of the sentences, amount to merely being grounded without driving
    privileges. The respondents continue to go to school and work.  Now that the first year is over, they have
    complete freedom during the day and can even go out after curfew with a
    parent’s note. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Conditions such as these fall far short of
    communicating denunciation and general deterrence in sufficiently strong and
    clear terms. Moreover, the circumstances of this case require the added
    deterrent effect of significant driving prohibitions to support the imposition
    of conditional sentences. The sentences imposed, therefore, are not fit and
    call for this court’s intervention.    </p>
  <h2 style='page-break-after:auto'>(4)       Variation

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Conditional sentences should be punitive.  As the Supreme Court of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    stated in <i>R. v. Proulx</i>, at para. 117: “[P]unitive
    conditions such as house arrest should be the norm, not the exception.”  In my view, that comment applies throughout
    the duration of a conditional sentence.  Therefore, the house arrest conditions should be extended to the full
    term of the respondents’ conditional sentences. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> Turning to the driving prohibition, it is
    driving that is at the core of this case.  When young people are granted the privilege of driving they take on a
    grave responsibility.  When that
    privilege is abused through irresponsible conduct – in this case conduct that
    took a man’s life – the loss of the privilege must be felt, both by the
    perpetrators and by others who would engage in similar conduct. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Given
    that the sentencing judge chose to impose conditional sentences, it was
    necessary that he combine those sentences with sufficiently lengthy driving
    prohibitions to convey the message that conduct similar to that which occurred
    in this case will not be tolerated.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In my
    view, the driving prohibition should be extended from four years to seven
    years.  A driving prohibition that
    extends a further three years after the respondents complete their conditional
    sentences and probation would, it is hoped, have a meaningful impact,
    particularly in terms of general deterrence. </p>

    the house arrest terms originally limited to the first year of each
