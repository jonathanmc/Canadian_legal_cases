style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant, Her Majesty the Queen in Right of Canada, appeals an order allowing
    an application by the respondent, Katch McCain (formerly known as Luan Ceno), and
    declaring his ownership interest in $5,000 U.S. not to be affected by a currency
    seizure.  McCain entrusted the $5,000 to
    one Bujar Mehmeti who attempted to carry a total of $50,000
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      U.S.</st1:country-region>
    out of the
    country without complying with the statutory requirement to report the exportation
    of currency in excess of $10,000 CAD.  The effect of the application judge’s order is
    to entitle McCain to the return of the $5,000
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      U.S.</st1:country-region>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There is
    no issue that the application judge correctly articulated the statutory test
    for the return of seized currency to the respondent.  The issue raised on this appeal is whether the
    application judge erred in applying that test.  For the reasons that follow I would hold that he
    did. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>STATUTORY
    FRAMEWORK</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The <i>Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and
    Terrorist Financing Act</i>, S.C. 2000, c. 17 (the “Act”) received Royal Assent
    on June 29, 2000.  One of its stated
    objectives, set out in s. 3(a)(ii), is to require “the reporting of suspicious
    financial transactions and of cross-border movements of currency and monetary
    instruments”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To fulfill
    this objective, Part 2 of the Act provides for a currency reporting regime.  Under s. 12(1), persons importing or exporting
    currency or monetary instruments exceeding a prescribed threshold are required
    to submit a report to customs officials.  The prescribed threshold is currently set at
    $10,000 CAD or the foreign currency equivalent: see <i>Cross-border Currency and Monetary Instruments Reporting Regulations</i>,<i> </i>S.O.R./2002-412, s. 2.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the
    event an officer believes on reasonable grounds that s. 12(1) has been
    contravened, “the officer may seize as forfeit the currency or monetary
    instruments” under s. 18(1).  Under s.
    18(2), the seized currency or monetary instruments are to be returned on
    payment of a prescribed fee unless the officer believes on reasonable grounds
    that the currency or instruments are the “proceeds of crime… or funds for use
    in the financing of terrorist activities.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Act
    sets out two review procedures available to persons affected by a seizure.  Under s. 25, a person from whom currency or
    monetary instruments were seized or the lawful owner may apply to the Minister
    of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness for a decision “as to whether
    subsection 12(1) was contravened”.  Sections
    26 to 30 set out the detailed procedures in respect of such “first party”
    reviews and appeals. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The second
    procedure and the one pertinent to this appeal is the “third party claim”
    procedure.  Section 32(1) provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If currency or monetary instruments have been
    seized as forfeit under this Part, any person or entity, other than the person
    or entity in whose possession the currency or monetary instruments were when
    seized, who claims in respect of the currency or monetary instruments an
    interest as owner… may, within 90 days after the seizure, apply by notice in
    writing to the court for an order under section 33. </p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>In
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario, the term
    “court” refers to the Superior Court of Justice: see s. 32(5)(a) of the Act.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section 33
    sets out the three-part test that must be satisfied by an applicant who seeks
    such a declaration.  It is worth setting
    out s. 33 in full:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If, on the hearing of an application made under
    subsection 32(1), the court is satisfied </p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(<span class=italic><i>a</i></span>) that the applicant acquired the interest or right in good
    faith before the contravention in respect of which the seizure was made,</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(<span class=italic><i>b</i></span>) that the applicant is innocent of any complicity in the
    contravention of subsection 12(1) that resulted in the seizure and of any
    collusion in relation to that contravention, and</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(<span class=italic><i>c</i></span>) that the applicant exercised all reasonable care to ensure
    that any person permitted to obtain possession of the currency or monetary
    instruments seized would report them in accordance with subsection 12(1),</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>the applicant is entitled to an order declaring
    that their interest or right is not affected by the seizure and declaring the
    nature and extent of their interest or right at the time of the contravention.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>FACTS</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In 2005,
    five men (Mssrs. Vito, Kazazi, Ngjela, Kolleshi and the respondent McCain)
    entrusted money to a man named Bujar Mehmeti.  All five men were born and raised in either
    Kosovo or
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Albania</st1:country-region>
    before emigrating
    to

    of the Act.  Since the seizing officer
    was of the opinion that the funds were proceeds of crime or funds for use in
    the financing of terrorist activities, no terms of release were offered in
    accordance with s. 18(2).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The five

    of the money under s. 25: see <i>Canada v.
    Vito</i>, 2006 CanLII 28096 (Ont. S.C.).  That review was ultimately rejected by the
    Minister of Safety and Emergency Preparedness and no appeal was taken from it. </p>

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>THE
    DECISION OF THE APPLICATION JUDGE </h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    application judge held that the test for the return of seized funds under s. 33
    is conjunctive.  That is, an applicant
    must establish each of the three necessary criteria on a balance of probabilities. </p>
  <h3>(1)       Good
    Faith (s. 33(a))</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On the
    first element of the test, the application judge noted at para. 34 that “[a]lthough
    the concept of ‘good faith’ has an intangible, and at times abstract, quality,  in the context of [s. 33(a)] the court will
    look to the existence of a real and lawful interest in the subject currency <i>before</i> the s. 12(1) contravention”
    (emphasis in original).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The judge
    found at para. 35 of his reasons that each of the applicants had satisfactorily
    accounted for the lawful origin and possession of the currency that they had
    entrusted to Mehmeti “through gainful employment and the like.”  As this finding was not disputed by the
    parties on this appeal, the remainder of these reasons focus on the second and
    third elements of the s. 33 test.</p>
  <h3>(2)       Absence
    of Complicity or Collusion (s. 33(b))</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    application judge set out both common sense and authoritative definitions of
    the terms “complicity” and “collusion”.  At
    para. 36 he held that “[c]omplicity generally connotes acting as a party or
    accomplice with knowledge of the unlawful objective and an intention to
    participate in furtherance of attaining the objective.”  He quoted a passage from <i>Villeneuve v. Canada </i>(1999), 140 C.C.C. (3d) 564 (Que.
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ),
    at pp. 574-75 defining collusion as an agreement with an aim to mislead one or
    more persons.  Significantly, at para. 38
    of his reasons, the application judge held that “[t]he disqualifying complicity
    or collusion must relate to the s. 12(1) non-reporting contravention.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The application
    judge found that none of the applicants had directly deposed to an absence of
    complicity or collusion in their affidavit evidence.  However, at para. 44 of his reasons he held that
    the evidence of three of the applicants “may be fairly taken to have addressed
    the lack of any complicity or collusion.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>By
    contrast, the application judge found at para. 43 that neither Kolleshi nor the
    respondent McCain had made “any statement touching on the matter of reporting.”  At para. 45 of his reasons, he stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Both Kolleshi and McCain have failed to establish,
    on a balance of probabilities, innocence of any complicity or collusion in the
    s. 12(1) contravention.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>However, later in
    his reasons, he described this finding as being made for “analytical purposes”

  <h3>(3)       All
    Reasonable Care (s. 33(c))</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    application judge began by emphasizing that a person involved in the export of
    currency is not simply required to exhibit due care or reasonable caution.  Rather, “all reasonable care” must be taken.  He noted that while there is a paucity of
    jurisprudence on s. 33, interpretive guidance can be gleaned from decisions
    considering analogous provisions found in the <i>Customs and Excise Act</i>.  He
    then reviewed the classic definition of the term “all reasonable care” by
    Fauteaux J. in <i>Canada (Deputy Minister of
    National Revenue, Customs and Excise) v. Industrial Acceptance Corp.</i>,
    [1958] S.C.R. 645, at pp. 647-48:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Under subs. (5) of s. 166 of the Act, the claimant becomes entitled to
    an order that his interest is not affected by the seizure, once he has shown,
    to the satisfaction of the Judge, that he did, at the relevant time, exercise
    all reasonable care to satisfy himself that the vehicle was not likely to be
    used contrary to the provisions of the Act.
     The condition precedent to the right to
    obtain the relief is precisely that a positive and specific inquiry as to
    whether there are reasons to suspect such a likelihood, was made and negatived
    any reason for such suspicions.  The fact
    that such an inquiry might offend the person who is the subject thereof cannot
    minimize the obligation to make it.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>What, in each of the cases, the inquiry should be
    to satisfy the standard of care set forth in subs. (5) of s. 166, is for the
    Judge before whom relief is claimed to appreciate in the light of the
    particular circumstances of the case under consideration.  It is obvious that the nature and extent of
    such inquiries will differ widely in various cases and that no general rule can
    be laid down as to what they must consist of.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It may very well be that in certain areas and under
    certain circumstances, the specific and positive inquiries to which I have
    referred should include an inquiry of the police or some other public
    authority; but such procedure cannot be held to be necessary in all of the
    cases to satisfy the standard of care described in the enactment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    application judge also quoted a passage from the concurring judgment of
    Cartwright J. in <i>Industrial Acceptance</i>,
    found at p. 651:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The standard of conduct required by the statute is,
    I think, the same as that required by the common law of a person under a duty
    to take care, i.e., that of the reasonable man.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The question in the case at bar appears to me to be
    whether we can say that the courts below have erred in holding that the
    respondent used all the care which a reasonable man, mindful of his duty under
    the Act, would have used in the
    particular circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    application judge observed that the <i>Industrial
    Acceptance </i>decision has been consistently applied in forfeiture cases.  At para. 49 of his reasons, he provided a
    helpful summary of jurisprudential guidelines which I reproduce below:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1)       the standard is that of a reasonable
    person in similar circumstances to the applicant.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2)       as a general rule, the applicant has the
    burden of demonstrating that he, she or it made the relevant inquiry or took
    positive action to ensure the individual entrusted with possession of the
    relevant item complied with the applicable statute.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3)       confidence in the ultimate possessor and
    lack of awareness of his or her intentions does not amount to discharge of the
    obligation to take all reasonable care.<a

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The application
    judge then applied these principles to the evidence on the applications before
    him.  The core of his reasons are reproduced
    below:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[50]     Although
    for analytical purposes I noted that McCain’s affidavit failed the [s. 33(b)]
    requirement, I am satisfied that he has discharged the burden of showing that
    the $5000. USD given to Mehmeti is not only less than the $10,000.CAD limit but
    also that he was not reasonably under any legal obligation to take steps to
    ensure that if Mehmeti left Canada with his money pooled with the funds of
    others that the mandatory reporting regime would be complied with.  The seized funds of $5,000 USD shall be
    returned to McCain.   </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[51]     The
    court must consider all the circumstances including such factors as the
    character of the assigned possession, the nature of the relationship between
    the applicant and the possessor from whom the seizure was made, the relative
    ease or difficulty for the applicant to make inquiries or to take steps to
    ensure the law was complied with, any motive for the applicant not to take
    positive action, and the existence of any facts known to the applicant suggesting
    a breach of the law was likely.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[52]     In
    the circumstances here, a legal standard governed the export of funds exceeding
    a value of $10,000.CAD. Ignorance of the law and in turn failure to take steps
    to ensure compliance is antithetical to the discharge of all reasonable care. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[53]     The
    applicants indicate that they became aware that Mehmeti was travelling to
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Albania</st1:country-region>
    in
    August of 2005.  There is a significant
    element of vagueness here.  There is no
    detail as to how these applicants came to have this knowledge.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[54]     Although
    Mehmeti was known to Ngjela, Kazazi and Kolleshi, their affidavits provide
    almost no detail as to arrangements or instructions regarding the currency they
    were entrusting to Mehmeti.  There is no
    evidence that Mehmeti was a friend or acquaintance of Vito.  Where and when were funds provided to
    Mehmeti?  Was a receipt given? Was the
    courier provided a service fee?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[55]     Giving
    a non-family member thousands of dollars in currency, to physically take to a
    part of the world at times experiencing political instability, is not without
    risk. Even leaving the deemed knowledge of the s. 12(1) reporting requirement
    to the side, in circumstances of rejection of a bank transfer option, common
    sense and prudence would dictate that the person entrusting possession to the
    courier would himself inquire as to any applicable legal restrictions or take
    steps to ensure that the courier was instructed to comply, and would comply,
    with any and all regulations relating to export of currency.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[56]     International
    efforts to combat illicit drug profiteering as well as global fund-raising for
    terrorism demand that legislative steps by various countries, such as the <i>Act</i>,
    be firmly administered. Forgiveness for non-compliance, in the absence of any
    positive action by third party claimants toward ensuring compliance, altogether
    too easily permits defeat of the interdiction scheme.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[57]     The
    exercise of all reasonable care would not have been onerous for the applicants.
    On the evidence, none of the applicants took any measures at all to ensure that
    Mehmeti complied with any Canadian laws which might govern the export of
    thousands of dollars of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">U.S.</st1:country-region>
    currency by a non-commercial courier. The applicants have not met the burden of
    demonstrating that &quot;all reasonable care&quot; was taken within the meaning
    of [s. 33(c)] of the <i>Act</i>. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span> </span>ANALYSIS </h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant submits that the application judge erred by not giving effect to his
    finding that the respondent’s affidavit was silent on the issue of collusion
    and conspiracy. The appellant contends that since each element of the s. 33
    test must be proven on a balance of probabilities, the application judge ought
    to have dismissed McCain’s application at that point.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I would agree that each element
    of the test in s. 33 must be proven on a balance of probabilities and the
    application judge was alive to this.  He
    found that Ceno’s affidavit did not address s. 33(b) and therefore he failed to
    satisfy the onus of showing that he did not collude with respect to the export
    of funds. <b>  </b> He
    chose to continue his analysis, however, because he appears to have been of the
    opinion that his conclusion respecting the “all reasonable care” component of
    s. 33(c) could be a factor that would negate collusion under s. 33(b). He
    held“the $5,000. USD given to Mehmeti is not only less than the $10,000.CAD
    limit but also that [McCain] was not reasonably under any legal obligation to take steps” to ensure Mehmeti
    complied with the reporting requirement.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>While I agree with the
    application judge that the phrase “all reasonable care” in s. 33(c) requires an
    examination of all the circumstances from the perspective of a reasonable
    person in the position of the third party applicant, I am of the opinion that
    the application judge erred in applying this analysis.  (It follows from my conclusion that I would
    reject the appellant’s submission that the decision in <i>Industrial Acceptance </i>always<i> </i>requires
    that the third party applicant must have taken positive steps, by inquiry or
    admonition, to ensure compliance with the regulation in issue.  That submission<i> </i>ignores the decision of this court respecting the same phrase in <i>Van Pham</i>.  See also <i>Greening

    into account all the circumstances, the criticisms and comments made by the
    application judge with respect to the shortcomings of the other applicants’
    affidavits apply with equal force to that of the respondent.  There is no detail as to how McCain learned that
    Mehmeti was travelling to Kosovo.  His
    affidavit provides almost no detail as to arrangements or instructions
    regarding the currency he was entrusting to Mehmeti.  Details as to where and when funds were
    provided to Mehmeti, whether a receipt for the money was given and whether
    Mehmeti was provided a service fee are all lacking.  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Further, McCain’s affidavit
    states: “<i>As is commonly the case</i>,
    when someone from our community is traveling to Albania/Kosovo, I asked Mr.
    Mehmeti to take the money that I had to Kosovo via
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Albania</st1:country-region>
    ” (emphasis added).  If it was common for members of the community
    to give a person going to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Albania</st1:country-region>
    and Kosovo money to carry for others, an inference may be drawn that McCain was
    aware that other persons may also give Mehmeti money to carry for them.  Even if McCain had no reason to think that
    Mehmeti would be carrying currency for other people, surely he would have
    turned his mind to the possibility that Mehmeti would take money of his own. </span></p>

    thousands of dollars to take to a relatively unstable part of the world.  As the application judge observed in relation

    courier would comply with all regulations relating to the export of
    currency.  </span></p>

      33 is not limited to applicants who have entrusted currency greater than

      across the Canadian border. Although McCain gave Mehmeti less than $10,000
      CAD, he must still satisfy each of the requirements of s. 33. The applications
      judge erred in reaching the conclusion he did in this case because he did
      not give sufficient weight to the factors he applied to the other accused.
      McCain did not take the care that a reasonable person in his circumstances
      would have taken and, by not doing so, he failed to exercise &ldquo;all
      reasonable care&rdquo; within the meaning of s. 33(c) of the Act. Finally,
      even if a finding that all reasonable care has been taken pursuant to s.
      33 (c) was made and that it is a relevant factor in determining whether
      there was collusion under s. 33(b), the application judge failed to explain
      how his finding respecting s. 33(c) was capable of negativing the requirement
