  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent pled guilty and was convicted of
    aggravated assault, break and enter and commit assault.  The effective sentence was 14 months
    calculated as follows: six months’ credit for the respondent’s 85 days in
    custody; two months’ credit for her time spent on bail; and a sentence of six
    months in jail.  In addition, she
    received three years’ probation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown appeals on the basis that the sentence as
    imposed was demonstrably unfit.  He
    submits that a sentence of two and a half years imprisonment ought to be
    imposed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The facts giving rise to the offence may be briefly
    summarized.  The respondent and Mr.
    Findlay had been cottage neighbours and friends for a long time.  The respondent and her husband got into a
    dispute with the local ratepayers’ association over whether a lot line could be
    moved.  They sued the association as well
    as Mr. Findlay, who was president of the association at the time.  They lost and costs were awarded against
    them.  They unsuccessfully appealed the
    case and had further costs awarded against them in March 2007.  At the time, the respondent and her husband
    were in financial difficulty.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On April 29, 2007, Mr. Findlay went to his
    cottage.  The respondent invaded Mr.
    Findlay’s cottage home while he was sleeping.  She walked into his bedroom with a large
    kitchen knife, jumped on top of him in his bed and stabbed him in the chest
    while yelling that he had ruined her life and she wanted him to die.  Fortunately, the respondent only landed two
    blows before Mr. Findlay grabbed the knife away, fled the cottage and took
    refuge in his neighbour’s house.  After
    pursuing Mr. Findlay, the respondent rattled the front door of the neighbour’s
    cottage and tried to peer inside.  Mr.
    Findlay called 9-1-1.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Eventually the respondent left the neighbour’s
    cottage.  The police located the
    respondent on the front step of her home with her daughter who, seeing the
    blood on the respondent, was asking her mother what she had done.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fortunately, Mr. Findlay was not seriously injured
    although the knife blade did nick his lung and stitches were required to close
    two cuts on his chest.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following her arrest, the respondent was detained for a
    30-day psychiatric assessment and sent to a mental health centre.  Her stay was extended to 60 days.  A medical report diagnosed the respondent as
    having major depressive disorder and associated anxiety, as well as symptoms of
    posttraumatic stress related to physical and sexual abuse suffered as a child.  The report concludes that the attack was
    influenced by the respondent’s emotional vulnerability but that she was not
    hallucinating or delusional at the time of the incident.  After the psychiatric assessment, the
    respondent remained in custody for a further three weeks.  In total, she spent 85 days in custody before
    bail was granted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent has completed the custodial portion of
    her sentence and is presently on parole living in the community.  The conditions under which the respondent
    served the jail time were especially stringent.  The facility in which she was incarcerated was
    in lockdown for three months.  As a
    result, her husband was allowed to visit her only once in a five week period and
    she was only permitted limited yard time.  Bathing was restricted to one shower every three or four days.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A letter from the respondent’s psychiatrist, filed as
    fresh evidence on this appeal, indicates that she is now emotionally stable, compliant
    with her medication and not a danger to others. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Unlike many home
    invasions, the offender is not part of a gang and has no history of violence.  There is no question that the offence was out
    of character for this 60-year old first offender who has no previous criminal
    antecedents.  Before us, the Crown very
    fairly conceded that specific deterrence was not an issue.  However, the Crown submits that the principle
    of general deterrence warrants the imposition of a further term of imprisonment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree with the Crown that, having regard to the
    serious nature of this unprovoked attack, the sentence imposed by the
    sentencing judge is demonstrably unfit and that, for reasons of general
    deterrence, a penitentiary sentence ought to have been imposed.  However, in light of the fresh medical
    evidence concerning the positive progress made by the respondent and as she has
    served the custodial part of her sentence, re-incarceration would serve no
    useful purpose in this case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, in the particular circumstances of this
    case, while leave to appeal is granted, the appeal as to sentence is dismissed.</p>
