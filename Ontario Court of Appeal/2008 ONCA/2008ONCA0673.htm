    which awarded the respondent retrospective and prospective child and spousal
    support as well as costs.  The appellant
    challenges the order on several bases, which we will deal with in turn.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that the motion judge erred in
    determining the amount of support by failing to take into account the
    appellant’s allegedly higher rates of income tax in the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>
    , where the appellant
    is currently employed.  However, there
    was no evidence before the motion judge regarding what income tax the appellant
    paid in the
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>
    and what he would have paid in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  Accordingly, there is no basis for this
    ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant argues that the motion judge erred in
    failing to impute income to the respondent.  The parties filed affidavits giving greatly differing perspectives on
    why the respondent’s employment income was significantly less than that of the
    appellant, and whether that difference resulted from career sacrifices made by
    the respondent during the parties almost 15 years of marriage.  However, rather than proceeding to trial to
    test each other’s perspectives, the parties elected to have the motion judge
    determine the issue on the basis of their affidavit evidence.  Neither party pressed for a trial.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the basis of the written record, the motion judge
    concluded that the respondent had needed spousal support since the parties’
    separation, a need that became more acute after her employment terminated as a
    result of a corporate restructuring.  It
    is implicit in the motion judge’s reasoning that he rejected the argument that
    the respondent should currently be self-sufficient and that she should have
    made greater efforts to obtain alternate employment or pursue retraining.  Instead, he accepted the respondent’s
    evidence, including the efforts she made to seek alternate employment.  Given the circumstances at the time the
    motion was heard, we see no basis to interfere with the motion judge’s decision
    not to impute income to the respondent. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The appellant also
    argues that the motion judge erred in ordering support commencing in May,
    2005.  We disagree.  The appellant lost his job with Nortel in
    November 2000, at which time he was earning approximately $108,000
    annually.  He continued to pay child and
    spousal support from his severance package until September, 2001.  In December 2001, the parties agreed to a
    nominal order for both child and spousal support.  The appellant did not obtain re-employment
    until April 5, 2005.  At that time, he
    returned to employment with a Nortel-related company.  That employment subsequently evolved into his
    current employment in the
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      United
      States</st1:country-region>
    .  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As soon as the respondent learned of the appellant’s
    re-employment she sought financial disclosure and put the appellant on notice that
    she would be seeking both child and spousal support.  The motion judge made a specific finding that
    the respondent did not delay in advancing her claim.  In these circumstances, we see no basis to
    interfere with the motion judge’s decision to order support retrospective to
    May 2005.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant challenges the amount of spousal support
    awarded from May 2005.  The motion judge
    awarded $2,000 monthly without explaining how he arrived at that amount or
    specifying the earnings on which it was based.  We note that, in determining the amount of support, it is helpful for a
    court to give at least brief reasons for the amount awarded, including the
    incomes upon which the award is based.  Such reasons inform not only appellate review, but are of important
    assistance to a court considering a future variation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, there is sufficient information in the
    record to determine support without putting the parties to the expense of
    another hearing.  It appears from the
    material before the motion judge that the respondent earned $28,938 in 2005 and
    $35,707 in 2006.  In 2007, she earned
    approximately $37,870, which includes her income until her termination as well
    as her subsequent severance package.  At
    the time the motion was argued, the respondent remained unemployed.  In contrast, the appellant filed material
    indicating that he earned an annualized income of $135,500 in 2005, $145,500 in
    2006 and $131,425 in 2007.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In arriving at the appropriate amount of
    support, the motion judge did not apply the <i>Spousal
    Support Advisory Guidelines </i>to these incomes.  However, ranges under the <i>Guidelines</i> were not provided to the
    motions judge.  In these circumstances,
    there can be no error in failing to apply the <i>Guidelines</i>: see <i>Fisher v.
    Fisher</i> (2008),
    88 O.R. (3d) 241 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, while the appellant’s factum referred to one
    range of <i>Guidelines</i> amounts, those
    amounts were based on an income imputed to the respondent of $35,000, which can
    only have application to the year 2007.  For subsequent years, the motion judge rejected imputation of income to
    the respondent.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, in our view, the motion judge erred in failing
    to provide any reason why spousal support should be $2,000 monthly for the
    respondent both in years when she earned no income and in years when she earned
    $28,000 to $37,000.  It seems apparent that
    the amount of spousal support should vary depending upon the respondent’s
    income.  We would accordingly vary
    spousal support during the period when the respondent was earning income to $1,700
    monthly from May 1 until the respondent’s severance apparently expired in
    November 2007.  This amount fits within
    the one <i>Guidelines</i> example given in
    the appellant’s factum, although it does not address the important factor of
    the duration of support.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We would not interfere with the motion judge’s award of
    $2,000 monthly from December 1, 2007.  That was the amount sought by the respondent in her notice of motion and
    appears to fall at the low end or even below the suggested <i>Guidelines</i> range given her current unemployment.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We observe that the lack of comprehensive reasons given
    by the motion judge poses difficulties for any application to vary.  The motion judge’s silence on the issue of
    duration of spousal support suggests the issue was not decided.  At that time, there was obviously a material
    uncertainty regarding the respondent’s further efforts to obtain employment or
    retraining or self-sufficiency.  On any
    subsequent variation hearing, the court should consider the appropriate
    duration of spousal support, including whether support should be limited or
    unlimited, which will in turn have an impact on the amount of support.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This is not a case where endless litigation may result
    from a review of these issues. Indeed, it is apparent from the parties’ choice
    of a motion as opposed to a trial forum, and from the skeletal reasons provided
    by the motion judge, that the parties and the judge did not fully canvass the
    issues with the intention of delineating the long-term obligations of the
    parties. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also challenges the motion judge’s award
    of $5,000 for arrears of child support.  Based on the figures provided by the parties, we see no error in this
    estimation.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the appellant challenges the motion judge’s
    costs award on the basis that it included a costs component for steps in the
    proceeding for which no costs were ordered.  In the circumstances, we would vary the costs awarded by the motion’s
    judge from $8,000 to $7,000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, the appeal is allowed only to the extent
    of varying paragraph 1 of the motion judge’s order to provide for spousal
    support of $1,700 from May 1, 2005 to and including November 1, 2007 and $2,000
    monthly spousal support from December 1, 2007 and to reduce the costs awarded
    from $8,000 to $7,000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the results of this appeal are mixed, we would make
    no order as to costs. </p>
