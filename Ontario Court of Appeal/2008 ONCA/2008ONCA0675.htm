  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant appeals from the judgment awarding sole custody of the parties’ two-year
    old son to the respondent father.  In addition, she appeals the access provisions
    as well as the order that no equalization payment be made between the parties.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is an unfortunate case in the sense that both parents came to court firmly
    of the view that any joint custody arrangement would be unworkable and, therefore,
    each seeks sole custody of their son.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    appeal, the appellant raises several issues, which can be summarized as follows:</p>
  <p>1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge erred in finding that the parties were equally capable of parenting
    the child;</p>
  <p>2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge took irrelevant considerations into account in awarding custody
    to the respondent;</p>
  <p>3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge failed to appropriately consider the evidence of the appellant;</p>
  <p>4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge conducted the trial in a manner that was prejudicial to the appellant;
    and</p>
  <p>5)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge incorrectly apprehended the facts with regard to the couple’s
    finances, resulting in an incorrect determination of the equalization payment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the opening of the appeal, the appellant brought an application to file fresh
    evidence, which consisted of a 43 page affidavit and 2 volumes of attachments.  The
    fresh evidence tendered consisted of information:</p>
  <p>i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that
    was available at the time of trial, but not presented because, according
    to the appellant, she was not given the opportunity to do so;</p>
  <p>ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>with
    respect to the issue of division of property put together by the appellant
    after the trial; and</p>
  <p>iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>concerning
    events that occurred after the decision under appeal was rendered.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the fresh material does not meet the test for admission on appeal
    and ought not to be admitted.  We are not satisfied that, with due diligence,
    the first two categories of material could not have been adduced at trial.  With
    respect to the materials dealing with post-judgment events, these are not,
    in our view, relevant to the decision under appeal.  These latter materials
    seek to establish that, subsequent to the decision, the respondent restricted
    or denied the appellant access pursuant to the provisions in the judgment
    on several occasions.  These concerns are best addressed either at the trial
    of an issue we are ordering or on a new application seeking a variance of
    the order for custody or the access provisions. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning
    to the appeal of the custody order, the trial judge’s reasons indicate that
    she had no concerns about the parenting skills of either parent and concluded
    that the parenting abilities of both parties were perfectly adequate.  The
    trial judge further agreed that a joint custody regime would be unworkable
    and inappropriate given the parties’ inability to effectively communicate
    about their son without animosity and disagreement.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge correctly observed that the only factor to be considered in deciding
    custody is “the best interests of the child as determined by reference to
    the condition, means, needs and other circumstances of the child.”  Having
    found that in most respects the parties are essentially on an equal footing,
    the trial judge then concluded that the decision turned primarily on her
    view of which parent best satisfied the criteria set out in s. 16(10) of
    the <i>Divorce Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. 3 (2<sup>nd</sup> Supp.), which reads
    as follows: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In making an order under this section, the court
    shall give effect to the principle that a child of the marriage should have
    as much contact with each spouse as is consistent with the best interests
    of the child, and for that purpose, shall take into consideration the willingness
    of the person for whom custody is sought to facilitate such contact.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applying
    s. 16(10), the trial judge then concluded that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The … evidence satisfied me that not only was a
    joint custody order contrary to Stephen’s best interests because of Mrs.
    Jamieson’s personality and her attitude towards Mr. Jamieson, combined with
    her over-protectiveness of Stephen, this evidence satisfied me that Stephen’s
    best interests could only be satisfied by Mr. Jamieson having sole custody.  He
    will ensure maximum contact between Mrs. Jamieson and Stephen.  Mrs. Jamieson,
    I am satisfied on the evidence, would not do that.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    see no error in the trial judge’s conclusion on this issue.  There is ample
    evidence in the record to support this finding.  In particular, we note that
    the trial judge relied on the evidence of Ms. VanderSlikke, a child and family
    services worker who had been involved with the parties for over a year.  Ms.
    VanderSlikke testified at trial that she had investigated a number of complaints
    made by the appellant concerning the respondent’s care of the child.  Her
    investigation of these complaints, including her attendance at the respondent’s
    home on at least eight occasions, left her with no concern about the respondent’s
    parenting abilities.  Despite this evidence, the appellant continued to take
    the position, even at trial, that there were serious concerns about the respondent’s
    parenting skills.  She claimed that the respondent was “sneaky” and must
    have “hid” things from Ms. VanderSlikke.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge accepted Ms. VanderSlikke’s evidence concerning the respondent’s
    parenting abilities and felt that the appellant’s insistence that the respondent
    had inadequate parenting skills only served to highlight her concern that
    the appellant was stubborn and would not facilitate contact between the child
    and the respondent.  We would not, therefore, give effect to the appellant’s
    submissions that the trial judge erred in finding that the parties were equally
    capable of parenting the child, considered irrelevant considerations in determining
    custody, and failed to appropriately consider the evidence of the appellant.  In
    our view, the trial judge applied the correct legal principles and her findings
    of fact were reasonably available on the record before her.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also argues that she was not given an opportunity to call some
    of the evidence she felt was necessary.  However, from our review of the
    transcript, it is apparent that the appellant never advised the trial judge
    that she wished to call additional witnesses, or that she needed additional
    time to consider her position.  We would not, therefore, give effect to this
    submission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant further alleges that the trial judge misapprehended the parties’ financial
    situation, resulting in an incorrect determination of the equalization payment.  In
    our view, the trial judge correctly reviewed and analysed the parties’ finances
    and we see no basis for interfering with her disposition in that regard.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    are, however, concerned with the trial judge’s disposition on the issue of
    access.  At the conclusion of the trial, the trial judge gave oral reasons
    for judgment, including a schedule of access.  The appellant immediately
    raised concerns, pointing out that the times at which access was to be granted
    were unworkable given the requirements of her employment and traffic considerations.  The
    appellant indicated that both the pick up and return times were at peak traffic
    times and could not be complied with given her hours of work.  In response
    to these concerns, the trial judge indicated that she did not sit in appeal
    of her own orders and that, subject to the order being set aside on appeal
    or the parties consenting to a change, she was not prepared to address the
    appellant’s concerns.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is apparent from the concerns raised by the appellant that certain aspects
    of the access order were problematic and may not have been workable.  The
    trial judge seems to have recognized this, but she was nonetheless unwilling
    to consider the further submissions of the appellant.  At the point when
    the concerns were raised, the trial judge was not <i>functus</i> and, in
    our view, ought to have received further submissions on the issue from the
    parties and sought to address the concerns raised.  This is particularly
    so given that the appellant was representing herself and the concerns raised
    appeared, on their face, to have merit.  Where, as here, there is an acrimonious
    relationship and ongoing issues concerning the exercise of access, it is
    important that concerns respecting a workable access schedule be fully aired.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    conclusion, we dismiss the appeal in all respects, except for the issue of
    access.  We order a trial of an issue on the question of access and remit
    that issue to the Superior Court of Justice to be determined by a judge,
    other than the trial judge who conducted the first trial, as may be assigned
    for that purpose.  The access provisions ordered by the trial judge are to
    remain in effect in the interim or until further order of the Superior Court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    light of the divided success on this appeal, we make no order as to costs.</p>
