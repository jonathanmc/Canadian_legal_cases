  <h4><span lang=EN-US>I.          Introduction</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How,
    if at all, should the costs of defending a lawsuit be apportioned between
    the insurer and insured when some, but not all, of the claims made in the
    lawsuit are covered by the applicable insurance policy?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would hold that the question of apportionment of costs should be determined
    by the operative language in the policy.  Where there is an unqualified obligation
    to pay for the defence of claims covered by the policy, as in this case,
    the insurer is required to pay all reasonable costs associated with the defence
    of those claims even if those costs further the defence of uncovered claims.  The
    insurer is not obliged to pay costs related solely to the defence of uncovered
    claims.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>II.        Overview</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Edward Hanis was hired by the respondent, the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    University of
    <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">
    Western Ontario (“Western”), in 1972 as director of the university’s Social
    Science Computing Laboratory (“SSCL”).  Dr. Hanis was fired in October 1986.  In
    March 1987 he was charged with a criminal offence arising out of his alleged
    misuse of the computing system at the SSCL.  Western had initiated the police
    investigation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Hanis sued Western in June 1987 and later amended the claim to add certain
    senior employees of the university.  The statement of claim advanced numerous
    allegations against Western and the individual defendants, including an allegation
    of malicious prosecution arising out of the criminal charges laid in March
    1987.  Dr. Hanis was acquitted of those charges in October of 1988.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Western
    had comprehensive general liability insurance policies with the appellant,
    Guardian Insurance Company of
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    (“Guardian”) in place, both when Dr. Hanis was fired in October 1986 (“Guardian
    Policy I”) and in March of 1987 when he was charged with the criminal offence
    (“Guardian Policy II”).  Under the policies, Guardian undertook to defend
    actions brought against Western if the claims were covered by the policy.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Western
    advised Guardian of Dr. Hanis’ lawsuit and sought coverage under the policies.  Guardian
    denied its duty to defend under either policy.  Western then commenced third
    party proceedings seeking a declaration that Guardian was required to provide
    a defence.  The third party action was held in abeyance by agreement while
    the main action continued.  Western retained its own counsel and proceeded
    to trial.  The trial occupied some 64 days between October 1993 and February
    1994.  McDermid J. dismissed the main action in its entirety in Reasons released
    March 17, 1995: see <i>Hanis v. Teevan</i>, [1995] O.J. No. 981 (S.C.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Hanis launched an appeal, which was allowed in part in June 1998.  This court
    held that Dr. Hanis had been denied procedural fairness and was therefore
    entitled to damages for wrongful dismissal:  see <i>Hanis v. Teevan</i> (1998),
    162 D.L.R. (4th) 414.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    2002, Western moved for summary judgment on its third party claim against
    Guardian.  On October 21, 2004, Power J. granted summary judgment in favour
    of Western.  He found no duty to defend under Guardian Policy I, but held
    that Guardian had a duty to defend at least some of the claims under Guardian
    Policy II:  see <i>Hanis v. University of Western Ontario</i> (2003), 67
    O.R. (3d) 539 (S.C.), at para. 98.  Power J. concluded that Guardian should
    have defended Western with respect to all claims, covered or not, subject
    to a reservation of its rights, if any, of apportionment.  On June 18, 2004,
    Power J. ordered the trial of the following issues:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i)        Is Guardian entitled to any allocation
    of the legal defence costs incurred by Western and, if so, what
    is the proper allocation?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii)       What is the proper quantum of Western’s
    legal defence costs?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iii)     What, if any, prejudgment interest is
    Western entitled to on any amounts owed by Guardian under (i) and (ii)
    above?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    the trial of these issues, Power J. held that Guardian was obliged to pay
    all defence costs related to the defence of claims covered by the policy
    even if those same costs furthered the defence of uncovered claims.  However,
    Guardian was not required to pay defence costs solely related to the defence
    of uncovered claims.  The trial judge determined that 5% of the defence costs
    related exclusively to uncovered claims.  Guardian was held liable for 95%
    of the costs, quantified at slightly more than two million dollars: see <i>Hanis
    v. University of Western Ontario </i>(2005), 32 C.C.L.I. (4th) 255, at para.
    198.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Guardian
    appeals the trial judge’s allocation of defence costs, arguing that Guardian
    should only be held responsible for 20% of the costs.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>III.       The Allocation Issue</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Most
    of Dr. Hanis’ claims, such as wrongful dismissal, were not covered by the
    Guardian policies.  Guardian contended that the only covered claim was malicious
    prosecution, which was covered by Guardian Policy II.  Guardian argued that
    it should not be held responsible for the majority of the defence costs since
    the majority of claims made by Dr. Hanis, particularly those at the centre
    of the trial, were not covered by any Guardian policy.  Guardian argued that
    it should not be responsible for any costs not connected to covered claims.
    Further, Guardian argued that costs associated with both covered and uncovered
    claims (“mixed claims”) should be allocated between Western and Guardian
    on a “fair and equitable” basis having regard to several factors.  In Guardian’s
    submission, the evidence led at the trial of the allocation issue justified
    allocating 80% of the defence costs to Western and 20% to Guardian.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Western
    submitted that its defence costs could not be attributed to one claim as
    opposed to another, given the manner in which the multiple claims were advanced
    and prosecuted by Dr. Hanis.  In effect, Dr. Hanis pleaded multiple causes
    of action arising out of one, complex and interconnected set of facts.  It
    was Western’s position that Guardian was obligated to compensate for all
    defence costs unless Guardian could demonstrate that some part of those costs
    could be attributed exclusively to an uncovered claim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge summarized his conclusions on the allocation issue at para. 193
    of his Reasons.  For present purposes, that summary may be further distilled
    as follows: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Where
    the same defence costs are incurred in the defence of both covered and uncovered
    claims, there should be no allocation of those costs and the insurer must
    bear the entirety of those costs.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Where
    there is no practical means of readily distinguishing between costs attributable
    to covered and uncovered claims there should be no allocation of those costs
    and the insurer should pay all of those costs.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Where
    the insurer has breached its contract with the insured by refusing to defend
    the claim, the burden is on the insurer to demonstrate what part, if any,
    of the defence costs clearly do not relate to covered claims. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    insurer has no liability to reimburse an insured for defence costs that can
    be identified by reliable evidence as relating solely to uncovered claims.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for Guardian frames the allocation issue as turning on a set of principles
    originating, for the most part, in American case law.  The objective of these
    principles is to divide the costs associated with the defence of “mixed claims” in
    a manner that is fair and equitable.  A fair and equitable division of costs
    is determined by considering a variety of factors, such as the proportion
    and significance of the covered and uncovered claims, the benefit derived
    by the insurer and insured in advancing the defence, the extent to which
    the work of the defence appears to be reasonably related to covered or uncovered
    claims, and the extent to which the defence effort would reasonably have
    been necessary if the only claims advanced were the covered claims.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    contrast, counsel for Western characterizes the allocation issue as one of
    contractual interpretation.  Counsel submits that any right Guardian might
    have to an allocation of defence costs where the same costs are incurred
    in the defence of both covered and uncovered claims must be found in the
    language of Guardian Policy II, the document governing the relationship between
    the parties.  The key provision describes Guardian’s duty to defend and its
    obligation to pay defence costs associated with that duty.  It is contended
    that the relevant provision contains an unqualified promise by Guardian to
    pay defence costs associated with the defence of claims covered by the policy.  It
    is argued that defence costs relating to covered claims are not taken out
    of the coverage simply because they also assist in the defence of uncovered
    claims.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    judgments of the New Zealand Court of Appeal and the Privy Council in <i>New
    Zealand Forest Products Ltd. v. New Zealand Insurance Co. Ltd</i>., [1996]
    2 N.Z.L.R. 20 (
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), rev’d [1997] 3 N.Z.L.R. 1 (P.C.), provide examples of the two different
    approaches advanced by counsel.  In that case, the insurer was obliged to
    pay the defence costs of officers and directors of the insured, by the terms
    of its policy with the insured.  The insured, one of its officers and several
    other defendants were sued in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    California.  The officer’s defence costs were covered by the relevant policy.  The
    other defendants were not covered by the policy.  The insurer argued that,
    insofar as defence costs were incurred for the benefit of both the covered
    and uncovered defendants, there should be an allocation of costs between
    the insurer and the other defendants.  The New Zealand Court of Appeal agreed.  The
    court held that “fairness” dictated an apportionment of defence costs when
    the benefit of those costs went to both covered defendants and uncovered
    defendants.  Gault J. put the fairness argument this way at pp. 28-29:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Where a director or officer commits a wrongful
    act as defined in the policy in the course of duties which attracts litigation
    it will almost invariably be the case that the company will be joined as
    a party.  That may be because of claims against the company as vicariously
    liable for the acts of the director or officer or because those acts were
    the acts of the company by which it is bound.  In such circumstances unless
    (as did not occur in this case) the director or officer is separately represented
    there will be much expenditure incurred in the defence of the proceedings
    which relates to the defence of each.  If each were independently insured
    it would be expected that there should be some apportionment of, or a right
    of contribution to, the defence costs.  Where there is insurance cover for
    the costs of one but not the other it is difficult to see why the same course
    should not be followed.  It hardly would follow from that that the benefit
    of the insurance cover would be negated.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Gault
    J. explained how costs should be allocated as between the insurer and the
    uncovered defendants.  Counsel’s submissions on behalf of Guardian echo the
    observations of Gault J. at p. 43:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>What is appropriate will be for assessment on the
    facts by reference to relative exposure, relative benefit and other factors
    as are considered applicable in the circumstances.  That may even include,
    where the facts dictate, recognition that the covered (count 3) claim was
    of such minor significance that only a very small allocation should be made
    to that. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    appeal to the Privy Council, the issue was characterized not as one that
    turned on considerations of fairness or equity, but as an exercise in contractual
    interpretation.  Lord Clyde observed at p. 5:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Much of the discussion in the lower Courts has
    been taken up with consideration of case law, particularly from Courts in
    the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">United States of America</st1:country-region>
    .  <i>But Their Lordships are clearly of the view that the true question
    here is one of construction of the terms of the policy. </i> [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    returned to that theme at p. 6:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Furthermore there seems to Their Lordships to be
    a possible danger in concentrating on case law in that the problem might
    seem to be one of applying principles of general application rather than
    construing the language of the particular policy. </p>

    pp. 5-6, Lord Clyde reviewed the terms of the policy, focusing on the provision
    requiring the insurer to pay defence costs.  He found no basis in the language
    for the allocation of costs relating to both covered and uncovered claims:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>On the ordinary meaning of the words which have
      been used it is reasonable to understand that the cover would extend to
      the whole costs incurred in the defence where the officer was the sole
      defendant</i>.<i>  Why then should the meaning of the words change simply
      because there is another defendant who is not covered by the policy?</i>  Moreover
      if an uninsured co-defendant was bankrupt or otherwise without means it
      would seem an odd result of the insurance that it should not cover the
      whole of the officer’s costs even though some of them related also to the
      defence of the co-defendant.  <i>Once it is accepted that the costs are
      not confined to those which relate solely and exclusively to the officer
      it is hard to find anything in the language which prevents the cover extending
      to all the costs which also relate to another defendant</i>. On the contrary
      the language points to the conclusion that all such costs are covered…<i>In
      contrast to such general terms there is no provision generally requiring
      the kind of allocation to be made for which the [insurers] contend.  It
      cannot be assumed that the insurers would not have anticipated the likelihood
      of the company being joined as a defendant along with one of  its officers
      and if provision of the kind contended for was intended that could readily
      have been included</i>…The obvious inference is that where, as here, the
      other defendants are not covered by insurance there is to be no restriction
      in the extent of the loss covered by the policy provided that it reasonably
      relates to the claim against the officer…. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    British Columbia Court of Appeal has favoured the contractual interpretation
    analysis used in the Privy Council over the “fair and equitable” approach
    advocated by the
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      New Zealand</st1:country-region>
    Court of Appeal.  In <i>Coronation Insurance Co. v. Clearly Canadian Beverage
    Corp.</i> (1999), 168 D.L.R. (4th) 366, at para. 41, the majority observed:  “Ultimately,
    the answer to the fairness debate lies not in either party’s particular view
    or expectations formulated after the fact, but in the parties’ intentions
    as expressed in the contract of insurance.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    also favour the contractual analysis.  The relationship between an insured
    and an insurer is contractual and must be governed primarily by the terms
    of the relevant policy of insurance.  The insurer’s obligations are found
    first and foremost in the policy.  Those obligations may include the obligation
    to pay all or some of the costs associated with the defence of covered claims.  It
    makes eminent sense that any inquiry as to the nature and scope of the insurer’s
    duty to pay those costs should start with the language of the policy.  I
    agree with the observations of Newbury J.A. in <i>Coronation Insurance </i>at
    para. 42 where, in the course of approving the contractual analysis approach,
    she stated:<i></i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my view this approach construes the language
    of the policy in a manner consistent with the usual rules of construction
    rather than according to some inferred “expectations” not apparent on a fair
    reading of the document; and it provides insureds with the full benefit of
    their policy.  It requires an insurer to state explicitly the basis, if any,
    on which coverage may be limited, and it avoids lengthy hearings designed
    to explore “metaphysical” underpinnings of why a corporation or its directors
    and officers might have acted as they did. [Citation omitted.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    see no unfairness to the insurer in holding it responsible for all reasonable
    costs related to the defence of covered claims if that is what is provided
    for by the language of the policy.  If the insurer has contracted to cover
    all defence costs relating to a claim, those costs do not increase because
    they also assist the insured in the defence of an uncovered claim.  The insurer’s
    exposure for liability for defence costs is not increased.  Similarly, the
    insured receives nothing more than what it bargained for
    – payment of all defence costs related to a covered claim.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An
    analysis based on an interpretation of the language of the policy also demonstrates
    the inappropriateness of the analogy drawn by the New Zealand Court of Appeal
    to cases involving apportionment issues between insurers.  Apportionment
    between insurers does not arise in the context of a contractual relationship
    that specifically addresses the obligation of one party to pay the defence
    costs of the other party.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for Guardian referred to two cases of this court that have accepted the principle
    that allocation of defence costs may well be appropriate where only some
    of the claims are covered by the policy: <i>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Insurance
    Co. v. Durabla Canada Ltd</i>. (1996), 29 O.R. (3d) 737; <i>Daher v. Economical
    Mutual Insurance Co.</i> (1996), 31 O.R. (3d) 472.  I recognize that these
    cases accept that it may be appropriate to allocate defence costs between
    the insurer and insured where only some of the claims are covered by the
    policy.  I do not understand counsel for Western to suggest otherwise.  However,
    in the context of defending covered and uncovered claims in the same suit,
    a distinction must be drawn between cases where defence costs are related
    exclusively to the defence of either covered or uncovered claims, and cases
    where the same costs are incurred in the defence of both covered and uncovered
    claims.  In the former circumstance, an allocation of costs would be required,
    barring a policy which provided for payment of defence costs relating to
    uncovered claims.  In the latter case, allocation would not be necessary
    unless the policy provided for allocation where the costs related to both
    covered and uncovered claims.  Neither <i>St. Paul Fire &amp; Marine Insurance
    Co. </i>nor <i>Daher</i> refer to the allocation of costs where those costs
    have been found to have been directed to both covered and uncovered claims.  That
    is the allocation issue raised on this appeal and that is the issue specifically
    addressed in <i>New Zealand Forrest Products Ltd</i>.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    same observation applies to <i>Continental Insurance Co. v. Dia Met Minerals
    Ltd</i>., [1996] 7 W.W.R. 408 (B.C.C.A.).  The court recognized that an allocation
    of defence costs was appropriate in cases where only some of the claims made
    against the insured were covered by the policy.  However, the court indicated
    at para. 19 that allocation was to be determined by reference to “what portion
    of the defence fees, if any, relate to claims covered by the Policy.”  This
    language suggests to me that defence fees relating to both covered and uncovered
    claims would be covered by the policy.  However, that issue was not before
    the court.  <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for Guardian also referred the court to several decisions at first instance.  It
    is submitted that these decisions accept that there must be an allocation
    of defence costs as between the insurer and insured in all cases where covered
    and uncovered claims based on different factual allegations are advanced
    in the same lawsuit:  see <i>Sommerfield v. Lombard Insurance Group</i> (2005),
    74 O.R. (3d) 571 (S.C.); <i>Scott v. Optimum Frontier Insurance Co</i>. (2005),
    38 C.C.L.I. (4th) 129 (Ont. S.C.); <i>Kelly Panteluk Construction Ltd. v.
    AXA Pacific Insurance Co.</i>, [2006] 6 W.W.R. 181 (Sask. Q.B.).<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    cases can reasonably be read as broadly as counsel for Guardian would read
    them.  If read that way I do not agree with them.  The cases do not look
    to the language of the policy as the primary consideration when assessing
    an allocation claim.  Instead, these cases assume that allocation is necessary
    where there are both covered and uncovered claims and impose what the court
    regards as a “fair” allocation.  For example, in <i>Sommerfield</i>,<i> </i>after
    determining that the primary cause of action asserted against the insured
    was not covered by the policy, the court noted at para. 42 that “[t]o require
    the insurer to pay for the entire defence in these unique circumstances would
    be unfair.”<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons set out above, I do not think that the nature and extent of the
    insurer’s obligation to pay defence costs is a question of fairness or unfairness.  Rather,
    it is a question of what the insurer has agreed to do in the policy.  The
    answer to that question lies in the language of the policy, not in judicial
    notions of fairness.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    turn now to the Guardian Policy II.  It provides the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]he insurer shall:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(1) defend in the name and on behalf of the
    Insured <i>and at the cost of the Insurer any civil action which may at any
    time be brought against the Insured</i> on account of such bodily injury
    or property damage but the Insurer shall have the right to make such investigation,
    negotiation and settlement of any claim as may be deemed expedient by the
    Insurer. [Emphasis added.] </p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>An extended definition of “bodily
    injury” appears under the Additional Coverages part of Guardian Policy II.  The
    definition includes malicious prosecution.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    need not examine the other provisions in the policy relevant to the scope
    of the coverage as Guardian conceded that the malicious prosecution claim
    was covered.  That coverage triggered Guardian’s duty to defend and its obligation
    to pay defence costs associated with the malicious prosecution claim.  Western
    argued that several additional claims were also covered.  Although the trial
    judge found that certain other claims were covered by Guardian Policy II,
    he observed that his conclusion on the allocation issue would have been the
    same even if the malicious prosecution claim was the only covered claim.  I
    agree with that observation and have proceeded on the basis that the malicious
    prosecution claim is the only claim covered.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    a plain reading of the relevant part of the policy, Guardian was responsible
    for all costs associated with the defence of the malicious prosecution claim.  There
    is nothing in the language of the policy that qualifies that obligation or
    suggests that it does not apply to so-called “mixed claims”.  For example,
    costs incurred by Western to meet and refute Dr. Hanis’ allegation that he
    was wrongfully dismissed in October 1986 might also be said to have been
    directed at negating the malice component of the malicious prosecution claim.  If
    the costs were reasonably associated with the defence of the malicious prosecution
    claim, nothing in the policy exempts Guardian from paying those costs simply
    because they also assisted Western in the defence of uncovered claims.  Guardian
    could have written qualifying words into its policy providing for an allocation
    of “mixed costs”, or requiring that the costs relate principally to a covered
    claim, if that had been intended.  It chose not to do so.  The court cannot
    do so for Guardian:  see <i>Vero Insurance Ltd. v. Baycorp Advantage Ltd.</i>,
    [2004] N.S.W.C.A. 390, at paras. 77-81; and <i>Coronation Insurance </i>at
    para. 42<i>.</i>  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    determination of what part of the defence costs related to the defence of
    the malicious prosecution claim was a factual one attracting the well-known
    standard of appellate deference.  The trial judge heard extensive evidence
    from counsel who had carriage of Western’s defence of the Hanis action.  Counsel
    explained how they characterized the case put against Western, the manner
    in which that case was prosecuted throughout the lengthy proceedings, and
    the defence strategy they employed on behalf of Western.  That strategy was
    largely successful.  After reviewing counsel’s evidence at length, the trial
    judge said at para. 167:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my opinion, they both gave credible testimony
    and were not moved off their essential thesis that, because of the mixed
    claims, and because the factual foundation underlying all claims was the
    same, it is impractical, artificial, and next to impossible to allocate with
    any precision the legal expenses incurred with respect to covered, mixed,
    and uncovered claims.  Their testimony, therefore, is preferable to an after-the-fact
    analysis of…the paper record.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge described Dr. Hanis’ case as consisting of a single ongoing “story” about
    his relationship with the university over a 14-year period.  According to
    Dr. Hanis’
    allegations, senior administrative officials at Western conducted a decade
    long vendetta against him.  These officials sought to destroy Dr. Hanis to
    protect their own interests and increase their own power within the university.  Dr.
    Hanis alleged that the efforts to destroy him and ruin his reputation included
    false allegations of a conflict of interest, infringement of his copyright
    interests, unfair treatment of him as an employee, wrongful dismissal, misappropriation
    of his property, interference with his ongoing contractual relationships
    with third parties, and malicious prosecution.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    describing the omnibus nature of the claims made by Dr. Hanis, the trial
    judge observed at para. 175:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Dr. Hanis, in his testimony and through his counsel,
    argued that a great deal of his damage claim was common to all his allegations – i.e.,
    to all his causes of action.  I find that it was impossible for the defence
    to pin down the damages to any particular cause of action even though the
    trial judge ordered Mr. Hanis to do so and even though an attempt was made
    to do so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge also found that the approach taken on behalf of Western in defence
    of the claims was reasonable.  His conclusions are found at paras. 176-77:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I find that, given this state of affairs, it was
    reasonable for the Defendants to treat the damages as being attributable
    to all causes of action.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I agree with the submission of counsel for the
    University that I cannot, and indeed should not, attempt to resolve this
    dispute by trying to relate the docketed legal feels and expenses to the
    particular claim or claims.  While it might be an overstatement to state
    categorically that this would be an impossible task, in my opinion, it would
    be close to impossible.  I agree with the University that it was reasonable
    for it not to have focused on specific legal labels or causes of action or
    allegations in the course of defending against Mr. Hanis’ claims.  Counsel’s
    decision to treat the case against the Defendants as a fact-based one and
    attempting to undermine his entire “story” was a reasonable manner in which
    to defend the action.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    accepted Western’s characterization of the nature of the case put forward
    by Dr. Hanis and having found that the approach taken to the defence of that
    claim was reasonable, the trial judge held, at paras. 194 and 198, that a
    small part of the defence costs related exclusively to uncovered claims.  While
    acknowledging that the amount attributable solely to uncovered costs could
    not be fixed with scientific certainty, the trial judge valued those costs
    at 5% of the total defence costs. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    findings of fact outlined above are supported by the evidence heard on the
    trial of the issue.  Indeed, the evidence is virtually uncontradicted.  Counsel
    for Guardian, no doubt sensitive to the deference owed to factual findings,
    does not really challenge those findings.  He argues that, on a reasonable
    view of the evidence led by Western, the defence costs attributable to both
    covered and uncovered claims went principally to uncovered claims and called
    for an allocation of those costs even if that allocation must be done on
    a “rough and ready” basis.  For the reasons set out above, I do not agree
    that Guardian’s policy provides for allocation of defence costs if those
    costs relate to a covered claim.  I would affirm the trial judge’s finding
    that 95% of the defence costs related to the defence of a covered claim and
    were, therefore, properly allocated to Guardian.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My
    characterization of the allocation issue as one of contractual interpretation
    leads to three additional observations concerning the principles drawn from
    the cases put forward by both counsel.  <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    a contractual interpretation approach dictates the rejection of the position
    taken in some cases that where the insurer fails to defend a covered claim
    it must, presumably by way of some sort of penalty, assume the defence costs
    of all claims both covered and uncovered: see e.g. <i>Modern Livestock Ltd.
    v. Kansa General Insurance Co</i>. (1993), 11 Alta. L.R. (3d) 355 (Q.B.),
    at p. 368, aff’d on other grounds (1994), 24 Alta. L.R. (3d) 21 (C.A.).  <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    can see no justification for imposing upon the insurer, as a consequence
    of its breach of contract, an obligation to pay defence costs that are clearly
    not covered by the contract.  That does not mean that the insurer’s failure
    to defend will not have ramifications in a subsequent dispute over the allocation
    of defence costs.  As this case demonstrates, if the insured is left to defend
    the case on its own, the insurer may have a very difficult time in a subsequent
    proceeding refuting the insured’s position as to the allocation of the defence
    costs.  If those costs are reasonable, and if under the terms of the policy
    the insurer is obligated to pay those costs, the insurer cannot escape that
    obligation by demonstrating that the litigation could have been conducted
    differently, or that with the benefit of hindsight certain costs were unnecessary.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My
    second observation arises out of the language of the cases, as reflected
    in the Reasons of the trial judge, at para. 193, to the effect that the insurer
    must pay the costs where there is no practical means of distinguishing between
    costs referable to the covered and uncovered claims.  This language is potentially
    misleading.  I think the cases are, in the main, referring to situations
    where the costs are incurred for both covered and uncovered claims.  It is
    preferable to express the finding in that way, as it makes more obvious the
    insurer’s obligation to pay those defence costs, assuming the policy requires
    payment of all costs related to the defence of a covered claim.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My
    third observation relates to the onus of proof.  The trial judge, at paras.
    193-98, relying on a line of authority, appeared to place the legal burden
    of proof on Guardian to clearly demonstrate what portion of the defence costs
    related exclusively to uncovered claims.  I question whether there is any
    compelling reason to depart from the general rule that the party claiming
    damages bears the ultimate or legal burden of proof on that issue, including
    proving the quantum of damages suffered.  However, on the trial judge’s findings
    of fact, I am satisfied that Western clearly established that only a very
    small fraction of the defence costs related exclusively to uncovered claims.  The
    trial judge’s finding that 5% of the defence costs related only to uncovered
    claims is fully justified even if Western carries the burden of proof on
    that issue.  <i></i></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>IV.       Other Grounds of

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Guardian
    advanced additional arguments in its factum.  Two of these grounds, one relating
    to the prejudgment interest awarded and the other to one facet of the costs
    award made by the trial judge, were not pressed in oral argument.  I need
    not set out the particulars of either award.  Both reflect an exercise in
    judicial discretion and I see no reason to interfere with the manner in which
    that discretion was exercised.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for Guardian also argued that the trial judge erred in holding that certain
    claims other than the malicious prosecution claim were covered by Guardian
    Policy II.  It is not necessary to address the merits of this submission
    as my analysis of the allocation issue has assumed that the malicious prosecution
    claim was the only claim covered by the policy.  I would uphold the trial
    judge’s ruling on the allocation issue assuming that malicious prosecution
    was the only claim covered.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    counsel for Guardian submitted that the allocation of defence costs was justified
    because almost all of the relevant events predated the coverage provided
    by Guardian Policy II.  I cannot accept this submission.  The alleged act
    of malicious prosecution occurred during the currency of Guardian Policy
    II.  Guardian accepts that it had a duty to defend the malicious prosecution
    claim and to pay the defence costs relating to that claim.  As Guardian was
    on coverage when the alleged malicious prosecution occurred, the timing of
    the events germane to the proof or defence of that claim is irrelevant to
    Guardian’s duty to defend and its obligation to pay defence costs related
    to the malicious prosecution claim.  </p>
