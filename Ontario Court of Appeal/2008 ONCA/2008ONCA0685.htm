  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>      Great
      Glasses also offers free “eye tests” to its customers. These
    “eye tests” are not administered by provincially licensed optometrists or
    physicians, rather by a machine, the Eyelogic System, operated by a store
    employee. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>      The
      Eyelogic System measures the refractive error in the customer’s vision
      and produces data that an employee then uses to identify the lenses necessary
      to correct the error. The Eyelogic System does <i>not</i> detect any diseases
      of the eye that might impair the customer’s vision. Nor does an optometrist
      or a physician examine the customer, much less provide a prescription for
      corrective lenses.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      judge of the Superior Court of Justice ordered Bergez, his wife Joanne,
      and two companies connected with Great Glasses to comply with provincial
      law governing the prescription and dispensation of corrective lenses. More
      specifically, the judge barred the appellants from prescribing and dispensing
      corrective lenses without a prescription from an optometrist or physician.
      Included in the prohibition was a ban on the individual appellants preventing
      them from permitting any employees who were not opticians, physicians or
      optometrists from dispensing corrective lenses absent proper delegated
      authority.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Most
      customers of “Great Glasses” do not have a prescription for corrective
      lenses, thus take advantage of the free “eye tests”. These tests, administered
      by a store employee using the Eyelogic System and nothing else, measure
      refractive error only. The data generated by the machine, rather than tests
      performed by a licensed optometrist or physician, defines the composition
      of any corrective lenses that will be provided to the customer. Those who
      enter a Great Glasses store without a prescription for corrective lenses
      from either an optometrist or an ophthalmologist may well leave the store
      with corrective lenses, but they leave as prescriptionless as they entered.</span></p>

    or dispensing, for vision or eye problems, corrective lenses, other than

      late June, 2005, about two years after it had obtained the compliance order  <i>COM</i> invoked
      rules 60.05 and 60.11 before Crane J. of the Superior Court of Justice.
      The principal order <i>COM</i> sought was a finding that the several appellants,
      individual and corporate, were in contempt for failure to adhere to the
      compliance order made two years earlier by Harris J. <i>COM</i> sought
      a substantial fine as the penality to be imposed, the amount of which was
      to be determined on the basis of information acquired from Bruce Bergez
      by production of documents and examination under oath, <i>after</i> a finding
      of contempt had been made. Typically, <i>COM</i> also proposed several
      means by which the appellants could purge their contempt.</span></p>

      the end of a two-day hearing, Crane J. found the several appellants in
      contempt of the earlier compliance order of Harris J. and imposed a fine
      of $1,000,000.00 to be paid by Bruce Bergez, with specific enforcement
      provisions in default of payment. The corporate appellants were made jointly
      and severally liable for payment of the fine. The individual appellants
      were required to do or refrain from doing several things in order to purge
      their contempt. </span></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      imposed as a consequence.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellants say that the finding of contempt is fatally flawed both procedurally
      and substantively. The procedural errors begin with the failure of the
      Notice of Application to specify the precise conduct, whether act or omission,
      that constitutes the contempt. Thereafter, the hearing itself was flawed:
      it failed to keep separate the liability and penalty phases. As a result,
      evidence relevant and admissible on penalty only was received and improperly
      used to establish liability. Between the finding of liability and the imposition
      of penalty, the appellants were never offered the chance to purge their
      contempt, a matter which, had they done so, was relevant to the nature
      and extent of punishment imposed. And the application judge failed to provide
      adequate assistance to the only appellant who appeared there, self-represented,
      Bruce Bergez.</span></p>

      appellants also contend that the finding of contempt is unsupportable substantively,
      even if the hearing itself was conducted properly. The prosecutor failed
      to prove the essential elements of contempt with the necessary degree of
      certainty, at the very least against Joanne Bergez. The findings of liability
      were grounded upon evidence obtained by constitutional infringement and,
      in at least one instance, otherwise inadmissible. The application judge
      failed to make findings of credibility critical to his determination of
      liability and applied the wrong standard of proof. </span></p>

      as an optician, a dispenser of corrective lenses. While the consequences
      of adverse findings at the conclusion of each application differed, the
      subject-matter was the same. In general terms, performing controlled acts
      without the required authority. Diagnosing and prescribing, controlled
      acts restricted to optometrists and physicians. Dispensing without a prescription
      from an optometrist or a physician.</span></p>

      subject-matter of the proceedings was Bruce Bergez’ home turf: what he
      could and could not do as a member of a regulated health profession. He
      was not a criminal defendant, with language difficulties or cognitive impairment,
      defending himself in a jury trial where his liability fell to be determined

      the contempt hearing, Crane J. advised Bruce Bergez that the central issue
      at the hearing was whether Bergez had contravened the order of Harris J.
      The contempt hearing judge imposed no time limits upon Bergez’ oral submissions
      and scheduled them to minimize the likelihood of interruption. The judge
      confirmed his understanding of Bergez’ submissions and allowed him to advance
      a defence not previously put forward. Crane J. explained to Bergez the
      difference between submissions and evidence, but never curtailed Bergez’ right
      to adduce evidence or to make submissions.</span></p>

      Bruce Bergez represented himself because that is what he wanted to do.
      He wanted to plead his own case, to make his own submissions, to do battle
      with the prosecutor. Not once did he seek representation. And not once,
      when he asked for help, did he not receive it.</span></p>

      ground reduces to a complaint that the failure of Crane J. to provide assistance
      to the self-represented appellant rendered the proceedings unfair. In circumstances
      like these, it is helpful to recall what this Court said several years
      ago about the standard by which we should determine whether proceedings
      involving the self-represented were unfair. In <i>Davids v. Davids</i>,
      [1999] O.J. No. 3930, this Court said at para. 36: </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[36]  … The fairness of this trial is not measured
    by comparing the appellant’s conduct of his own case with the conduct of
    that case by a competent lawyer. If that were the measure of fairness, trial
    judges could only require persons to proceed to trial without counsel in
    those rare cases where an unrepresented person could present his or her case
    as effectively as counsel. Fairness does not demand that the unrepresented
    litigant be able to present his case as effectively as a competent lawyer.
    Rather, it demands that he have a fair opportunity to present his case to
    the best of his ability. Nor does fairness dictate that the unrepresented
    litigant have a lawyer’s familiarity with procedures and forensic tactics.
    It does require that the trial judge treat the litigant fairly and attempt
    to accommodate unrepresented litigants’ unfamiliarity with the process so
    as to permit them to present their case. In doing so, the trial judge must,
    of course, respect the rights of the other party.</p>

        in order to establish criminal contempt:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            To establish criminal contempt the
    Crown must prove that the accused defied or disobeyed a court order in a
    public way (the <i>actus reus</i>), with intent, knowledge or recklessness
    as to the fact that the public disobedience will tend to depreciate the authority
    of the court (the <i>mens rea</i>). The Crown must prove these elements beyond
    a reasonable doubt. As in other criminal offences, however, the necessary <i>mens
    rea</i> may be inferred from the circumstances. An open and public defiance
    of a court order will tend to depreciate the authority of the court. Therefore
    when it is clear the accused must have known his or her act of defiance will
    be public, it may be inferred that he or she was at least reckless as to
    whether the authority of the court would be brought into contempt. On the
    other hand, if the circumstances  leave a reasonable doubt as to whether
    the breach was or should be expected to have this public quality, then the
    necessary <i>mens rea </i>would not be present and the accused would be acquitted,
    even if the matter in fact became public. While publicity is required for
    the offence, a civil contempt is not converted to a criminal contempt merely
    because it attracts publicity, as the union contends, but rather because
    it constitutes a public act of defiance of the court in circumstances where
    the accused knew, intended or was reckless as to the fact that the act would
    publicly bring the court into contempt.</p>

lang=EN-US>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As
      a general rule, the procedure followed on contempt hearings reflects the
      burden of proof imposed and the essential elements of contempt. The prosecutor’s
      case on liability proceeds first, thereafter any defence offered. Where
      liability is established, the contemnor is usually offered an opportunity
      to purge his or her contempt before the penalty or punishment phase of
      proceedings begins.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      form of the hearing, to some extent at least, lies within the discretion

      substance, a consolidated hearing, in other words, a proceeding that considers
      both liability and penalty in the same hearing, may cause unfairness or

      are discrete issues. Each falls to be decided on the basis of evidence
      that is relevant, material and admissible on the issue being considered.
      Evidence that is relevant, material and admissible on one issue may be
      irrelevant, immaterial or inadmissible on the other. In a single hearing,
      there is always the risk that evidence relevant, material and admissible
      on one issue will be misapplied to the other, for example to liability
      instead of penalty. To permit the introduction of evidence that bears on
      penalty only in a hearing in which liability has not yet been determined
      also lends an appearance of pre-judgment to the proceedings and forces
      the alleged contemnor to defend on inconsistent grounds.</span></p>

      first and penalty second, the hearing before Crane J. considered both liability

      untreated disease processes or other impairments of vision, and in the
      result, providing corrective lenses inappropriate for the client and potentially
      harmful was relevant only to penalty. Evidence of the profitability of
      the Great Glasses model, like the evidence of harm, was relevant only to
      penalty, not to liability. Likewise, a finding of professional misconduct

      in a single hearing on the finding of liability must begin with an acknowledgement

      judge. There is no <i>per se</i> rule that a hearing must proceed in two
      steps, liability first, then penalty if liability has been established.
      That a two-step procedure is preferable in most cases where liability is
      in issue can scarcely be disputed. Likewise, most would agree that the
      two-step procedure ensures that evidence or other material irrelevant to
      liability, but relevant to penalty, does not contaminate the determination
      of liability. In our imperfect world, we are left to assess the effect

      or physicians. Bruce Bergez and the corporate appellants were neither.
      Their repeated and public disobedience of the prohibitory order made by
      Harris J. was proven repeatedly and conclusively by evidence from former

    punished for the contempt, without any proof that the particular directors
    or officers proceeded against did or failed to do anything that was responsible
    for the said violation. I am unable to agree with that submission. I am not
    saying that before an officer or director can be committed for a contempt
    committed by the corporation that it must be shown that the officer aided
    or abetted the contempt. It may well be that the director or officer could
    be held in contempt, even though his role in the matter was purely passive:

    rise in some cases to a presumption that the director or officer did or failed
    to do something that caused the breach, and may put that officer or director
    on his defence. Where, however, it is clear on the evidence that the director
    or officer did all he could to ensure that the injunction would be abided

      helpful to recall the circumstances in which an appellant may raise on
      appeal an issue not advanced in the proceedings from which the appeal is
      taken.</span></p>

        v. Brown</i>, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 918 L’Heureux-Dubé, whose views on this
        issue evoked no disapproval from the majority despite her dissent on
        other grounds,  proposed this standard at p. 923:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            Courts have long frowned on the practice
    of raising new arguments on appeal. The concerns are twofold: first, prejudice
    to the other side caused by the lack of opportunity to respond and adduce
    evidence at trial and second, the lack of a sufficient record upon which
    to make the findings of fact necessary to properly rule on the new issue:
    see <i> Brown v. </i>Dean, [1910] A.C. 373 (H.L.), and <i>Perka v. The </i>Queen,
    [1984] 2 S.C.R. 232. </p>

      is also worth reminder that the <i>Charter</i> constrains government activity,
      not, at least as a general rule, the conduct of private persons or entities
      not implementing a specific government policy or program. <i>Eldridge v.
    <st1:State w:st="on">

      attract protection under s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>, which the appellants
      invoke here, requires state conduct that violates a reasonable expectation
      of privacy. A reasonable expectation of privacy is to be determined on
      the basis of the totality of the circumstances in each case. <i>R. v. Edwards</i>,
      [1996] 1 S.C.R. 128 at para. 45. The state activity of which complaint
      is made must also constitute a search or a seizure to fall within the protective
      sweep of s. 8. Activity that is neither falls beyond s. 8, not within its
      borders.</span></p>

      would not give effect to any grounds asserting a constitutional flaw in
      the collection or introduction of the evidence on liability, or on the
      nature of the evidence on which the finding of liability was made. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      complaints of constitutional infringement are raised for the first time
      on appeal. While the failure to raise these issues at first instance may
      not be tallied against the self-represented to the same extent as against
      a litigant who appeared with counsel, the principles underlying the general
      rule retain their vitality. Irrespective of the nature of the representation
      at first instance, the prejudice to the respondent from the lack of opportunity
      to complete the record remains a constant, likewise the insufficiency of
      the record upon which to make findings of fact essential to an informed
      ruling on the issue on appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      complaints of constitutional infringement in the collection of the prosecutor’s
      evidence does not reach the information provided by former employees of
      the corporate appellants. The evidence they offer, on its own, fully establishes
      the liability of the corporate appellants and Bruce Bergez.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>What
      is more is that the evidence gathered by investigators posing as Great
      Glasses customers displays no constitutional taint. Each engaged in a commercial
      transaction on business premises open to the public for commerce in corrective
      lenses. Even assuming that the investigators were state agents and that
      their activities amounted to a search or seizure, the reasonable expectation
      of privacy indispensible to a claim of constitutional violation is nowhere
      to be found. <i>R. v. Fitt</i>, [1995] N.S.J. No. 83 (C.A.) at para. 12,
      affirmed [1996] 1 S.C.R. 70.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      is not a case in which the resolution of factual controversies was essential
      in order to reach a conclusion that the liability of the corporate appellants
      and Bruce Bergez was established to the appropriate standard of proof.
      Said in a different way, there were no controverted facts relating to matters
      essential to a finding of liability on the part of any appellant, corporate
      or individual. The failure of the application judge to expressly articulate
      the precise standard of proof he applied, does not vitiate the finding,
      so long as the evidence proves contempt beyond a reasonable doubt. It does
      so here. <i>Clarfield v. Kopyto</i>, [1999] O.J. No. 672 (C.A.) at para.

      or admitted, not on the basis of facts to be determined later. Conflating
      liability and penalty phases may create an appearance of unfairness. On
      the other hand, it is not unusual in criminal proceedings where there has
      been a plea of guilty but a contest about aggravating or mitigating circumstances,

      imposed on regulated activity by a statute enacted in the public interest
