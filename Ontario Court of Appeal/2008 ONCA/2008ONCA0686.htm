    issue in this wrongful dismissal action was the proper period of reasonable
    notice that the employer was required to give the employee. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>The
    employee is a young man, now 30 years of age, who was head-hunted by the
    employer from a management track position at IBM where he had worked for
    4 years. He was given a substantial increase in salary and a signing bonus
    and worked for 2 1/2 years with the ultimate job title of Manager, Business
    Management, before being terminated in a downsizing program by the employer.
    His salary at the time of his termination was $102,000. Part of his responsibilities
    included overseeing $1 billion in revenue and managing two to five employees.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

class=StyleheadingNUMBER14ptChar><span style='
&quot;Times New \(W1\)&quot;'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>He
    based his claim on the proper application of the <i>Bardol</i> factors. He
    did not claim “<i>Wallace</i> damages” for bad faith in the manner of his
    dismissal. In his initial statement of claim, he claimed 7 months’ salary
    in lieu of notice, but amended his claim on consent shortly before trial
    to claim 10 months, because by the time of the trial, he had mitigated his
    damages and had found another job 10 months after the dismissal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Both
    counsel commendably tried to streamline the trial process by agreeing on
    as much as they could and narrowing the issues so that the trial lasted only
    2 days. They submitted an agreed statement of facts and only one witness
    was called: the employee/plaintiff. The employer also agreed, through counsel,
    that the employee had taken all reasonable steps to mitigate his damages.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
class=StyleheadingNUMBER14ptChar><span style='

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>The
    trial judge was very favourably impressed by the plaintiff, finding him to
    be a “reliable, honest, and sincere witness” who was forthright in his testimony
    and who did not appear to embellish during a thorough cross-examination.
    In his testimony, the employee recounted his employment history, the events
    surrounding his termination by the employer, and his job search thereafter,
    ultimately resulting in a new position 10 months later.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge was also concerned, based on the employee’s evidence, which was
    the only evidence on the issue, about the way in which the employer terminated
    the employee and concluded that the employer had breached its obligation
    of good faith and fair dealing in that regard. Having acknowledged that such
    a breach was not pleaded, nor were “<i>Wallace</i>” damages claimed, the
    trial judge stated that he was adding to the length of the notice period
    to reflect that breach.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge awarded the plaintiff damages for wrongful dismissal based on
    10 months salary in lieu of notice. He did not state by how much he had increased
    the notice period as <i>Wallace</i> damages.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    the appeal, the respondent accepts that the trial judge erred in awarding <i>Wallace</i> damages,
    but submits that based only on the <i>Bardol </i>factors, the proper range
    of notice was as high as 10 months, and on that basis, the appellant was
    entitled to receive the 10 months awarded by the trial judge.</p>

      argues that the proper range based on the <i>Bardol </i>factors was 2 to
      5 months and that based on the trial judge’s error, this court should apply
      the <i>Bardol </i>factors and make an award in that range.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Minott
      v. O’Shanter Development Co.</i> (1999), 42 O.R. (3d) 321 at para. 62,
      this court discussed the standard of review in wrongful dismissal cases:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>62.       This
    submission must be judged against the standard of appellate review of wrongful
    dismissal awards. Determining the period of reasonable notice is an art not
    a science. In each case trial judges must weigh and balance a catalogue of
    relevant factors. No two cases are identical; and, ordinarily, there is no
    one “right” figure for reasonable notice. Instead, most cases yield a range
    of reasonableness. Therefore, a trial judge’s determination of the period
    of reasonable notice is entitled to deference from an appellate court. An
    appeal court is not justified in interfering unless the figure arrived at
    by the trial judge is outside an acceptable range or unless, in arriving
    at the figure, the trial judge erred in principle or made an unreasonable
    finding of fact. <i>If the trial judge erred in principle, an appellate court
    may substitute its own figure. But it should do so sparingly if the trial
    judge’s award is within an acceptable range despite the error in principle.</i> [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this case, counsel attempted to present the case at trial as expeditiously
    and cost-effectively as possible, and both counsel agreed before this court
    that a new trial should be avoided if possible. We agree. In our view, and
    following <i>Minott,</i> the best approach is for this court to show deference
    to the trial judge while removing the effect of his error in law, by awarding
    the amount the trial judge would have awarded without adding anything for <i>Wallace</i> damages. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although
    the trial judge did not state what amount he attributed to <i>Wallace </i>damages,
    it is apparent that applying the <i>Bardol</i> factors, the trial judge had
    determined that the appellant merited an award at the high end of the appropriate
    range, taking into account manner and terms of hiring, his age, length of
    service, character of his employment and the overall job marketplace that
    was available for someone of his experience, training and qualifications.
    In that context, we can infer that the amount the trial judge added to the
    notice period for <i>Wallace </i>damages was not a significant component
    of the award, and would have been in the order of one month of salary in
    lieu of notice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    would therefore set aside the judgment of 10 months salary in lieu of notice
    and substitute an award of 9 months salary in lieu of notice minus the amount
    already paid.</p>

style='"Times New \(W1\)"'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    advised that they had agreed on the quantum of costs of the appeal, but asked
    us for an opportunity to address the issue of the payment of costs following
    release of these reasons. Counsel are to provide brief written submissions
    within 7 days of release of these reasons.</p>
