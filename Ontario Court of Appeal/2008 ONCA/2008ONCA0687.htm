style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants Gurcharn Singh Grewal (“Gurcharn”) and his daughter Baljot Grewal
    (“Baljot”), a minor, were involved in a motor vehicle accident on December
    11, 1999.  As a result of the accident, Gurcharn allegedly sustained serious
    personal injuries, including soft tissue injuries to his neck and lower back.  Apart
    from a brief return to the workforce, he has been unable to work since the
    date of the accident.  It is alleged that Baljot was also severely injured
    in the collision.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    September 4, 2002, the appellants commenced a negligence action against the
    respondents in which Gurcharn and Baljot sought non-pecuniary and pecuniary
    damages for their injuries and all the appellants claimed damages under s.
    61 of the <i>Family Law Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3 (the “FLA claims”).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondents moved for summary judgment dismissing the appellants’ claims
    on the basis that they were statute-barred due to the expiry of the two-year
    limitation period established under s. 206 of the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. H.8.  The motion judge accepted this assertion and, by order
    dated December 4, 2007, dismissed the appellants’
    action in its entirety.  She concluded that no genuine issue for trial arose
    because, in her view, by about May 19, 2000, Gurcharn “knew of the material
    facts that he needed to know to understand that he had a cause of action” against
    the respondents.  Consequently, the two-year limitation period commenced
    to run on May 19, 2000 and had expired before the appellants’ action was
    initiated.  The appellants appeal the dismissal of their action.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    our view, the motion judge’s decision cannot stand for several reasons.  First,
    it is common ground among the parties that the motion judge erred by dismissing
    Baljot’s claims and the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    FLA claims.  We agree.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    we conclude that the motion judge also erred by dismissing Gurcharn’s claim
    for non-pecuniary damages on the basis that no genuine issue for trial exists
    regarding the expiry of the limitation period.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Gurcharn’s
    non-pecuniary damages claim is governed by Bill 59, the motor vehicle insurance
    scheme applicable at the time of the accident.  Under Bill 59, claims for
    non-pecuniary damages arising from a motor vehicle accident cannot be advanced
    unless a specific ‘threshold’ is met, that is, unless an injured tort victim
    suffers
    “permanent serious disfigurement” or “permanent serious impairment of an
    important physical, mental or psychological function” as a result of the
    accident in question.  This threshold for a non-pecuniary damages claim,
    together with the nature of Gurcharn’s alleged injuries, which include soft
    tissue injuries, means that medical evidence of the severity and likely duration
    of Gurcharn’s injuries is especially important to the determination of the
    commencement date of the limitation period applicable in this case.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    support of her decision that the ‘discoverability’
    date for Gurcharn’s non-pecuniary damages claim was May 19, 2000, the motion
    judge stressed Gurcharn’s own evidence on cross-examination to the effect
    that, in the summer of 2000, he did not know when or if his neck pain would
    ever end.  The motion judge viewed this testimony as constituting an admission
    that, by May 19, 2000, Gurcharn “knew every material fact that he needed
    to know in order to understand that he had a cause of action”.  Respectfully,
    this conclusion is unsupportable.  The testimony in question merely indicated
    that, in the summer of 2000, Gurcharn was uncertain about his prognosis.  This
    is insufficient to ground a May 2000 discoverability date.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    record also indicates that in the spring of 2000 and again in June 2000,
    three independent medical assessments of Gurcharn suggested that he would
    make a full recovery or that he was not substantially disabled.  Based on
    this evidence, there is a live issue for trial concerning whether the threshold
    for a non-pecuniary damages claim under Bill 59 was met in May 2000.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge further relied on a notation in a medical chart entry prepared
    by Gurcharn’s family physician on March 23, 2000, which referenced “chronic
    pain”, as demonstrating that Gurcharn knew, by May 19, 2000, that he had
    a cause of action in negligence for non-pecuniary damages against the respondents.  The
    motion judge viewed this notation as “pivotal” to the determination of the
    date on which Gurcharn knew, or had to have known, that he had sustained
    compensable non-pecuniary damages.  In effect, the motion judge regarded
    the notation as evidencing a firm diagnosis in March 2000 of a permanent
    chronic pain disorder.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    disagree.  The meaning of the notation in question is unclear.  On this record,
    most of the contents of the chart entry are undecipherable and no explanation
    of the notation or other contents of the chart entry is available.  Moreover,
    it appears that no direct mention is made of disability –
    permanent or otherwise – in the chart entry.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    all these circumstances, there is a genuine issue for trial as to when Gurcharn
    learned or through the exercise of reasonable diligence ought to have learned
    that he had a cause of action against the respondents for general injuries
    under the threshold.  A trial is required to determine this issue.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    reach a similar conclusion regarding Gurcharn’s claim for pecuniary damages.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although
    the respondents rely heavily on the decision of this court in <i>Chenderovitch
    v. John Doe</i>, [2004] O.J. No. 681 to argue that Gurcharn’s pecuniary damages
    claim is statute-barred, that case is not dispositive of this issue.  In <i>Chenderovitch</i>,
    the plaintiff abandoned her pecuniary damages claim prior to the summary
    judgment motion at issue.  Thus, it was unnecessary for this court to determine
    whether her pecuniary damages claim was foreclosed by the expiry of a limitation
    period.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    addition, in this case, the nature and extent of Gurcharn’s pecuniary damages
    claim are unclear.  Perhaps for this reason, the motion judge’s consideration
    of this issue was terse.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    conclude that the issue whether Gurcharn’s pecuniary damages claim is statute-barred
    is best resolved on a full record.  This will ensure that any consideration
    of this important issue by this court will be informed by a reasoned analysis
    in the courts below.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    the reasons given, the appeal is allowed.  The appellants are entitled to
    the costs of this appeal fixed, by agreement of counsel, in the amount of
    $7,500, inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.  If, in light of this decision,
    the parties are unable to agree on the costs of the summary judgment motion,
    the Registrar of this court may be contacted, within fifteen days of these
    reasons, regarding the delivery of brief written costs submissions by both
    parties concerning that motion.</p>
