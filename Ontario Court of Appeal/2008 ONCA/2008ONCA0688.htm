    to an effective term of imprisonment of 12.5 years.  The appellant appeals on the basis that the
    sentence is unfit having regard to the appellant’s participation in the crime
    and the range of sentence in similar cases. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Facts<u></u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant and his girlfriend, Darlene Quick, were
    jointly charged with first degree murder for the shooting of Gordon
    Wilman.  Wilman had taken the couple into
    his home in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Trenton
    after they had been evicted from their apartment. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant and Quick had a tumultuous relationship
    prior to Wilman’s murder.  The appellant
    was jealous about Quick spending time with other men and some of his jealousy
    was directed at Wilman. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the evening before the murder, Quick did not return
    to Wilman’s residence.  The appellant
    found her the next afternoon at another man’s house.  They returned together to the Wilman
    residence on June 22, 2003, where they argued.  The appellant then loaded a shell into a shotgun owned by Wilman.  Quick took the gun and shot Wilman while he
    was seated in his truck.  The appellant,
    who was in Wilman’s house when the shot was fired, saw the shooting, came
    outside and dragged Wilman by his legs out of the truck and onto the ground.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant and Quick dug a shallow grave in a fire
    pit and covered Wilman’s body with dirt.  The next day, they stole Wilman’s car and absconded to
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    St. Catharines.  On July 5, 2003, they returned to
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Trenton and stayed at
    Wilman’s house.  The appellant helped
    Quick disguise herself.  The two
    transferred their belongings from Wilman’s car to his truck and left for a
    campground where they were arrested a couple of weeks later.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After being arrested, Quick confessed to the murder and
    stated that the appellant had helped her to bury the body.  Confronted with this information the
    appellant, who had previously given a statement denying any involvement in the
    killing, stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>“You helped me.  I didn’t do anything.  I helped bury it.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The next day the appellant provided a further statement
    to the authorities in which he admitted to seeing the shooting and assisting at
    the burial but denied any involvement in the pre-planning. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Quick pled guilty to second degree murder and received
    the mandatory sentence of life imprisonment.  Parole eligibility was set at the minimum ten years.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following a pre-trial, the appellant pled guilty to
    manslaughter. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During submissions on sentence, the Crown sought a
    sentence of fifteen years with credit given for his 23 months pre-trial custody
    on a 1:1 basis.  The defence submitted
    that the appropriate range of sentence was seven to nine years. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing judge credited the appellant’s pre-trial
    custody on a 2:1 basis for a total of 46 months and sentenced him to an
    additional nine years, for an effective sentence of 12 years and 10 months. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><u><span lang=EN-US>Issue and Analysis</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sole issue is the fitness of the appellant’s
    sentence.  The appellant submits his
    complicity in the offence cannot be more than minimal involvement falling into
    a class of manslaughter that can be called “foreseeable danger”, a class to be
    distinguished from “participant” or “near murder” cases.  The appellant points out that on the facts as
    read in, there is no indication he gave Quick the gun.   In addition to showing remorse by his plea
    of guilty, the appellant apologized to the family of the victim in court, an
    additional indication of remorse.  The
    appellant submits his sentence should be the four year minimum sentence for
    manslaughter with a firearm such as in <i>R.
    v. Cole</i>, [2004] O.J. No. 1691 and <i>R.
    v. Walcot</i>, [2001] B.C.C.A. 342.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown submits that the factual backgrounds in <i>Cole </i>and <i>Walcot</i> are missing many of the aggravating factors present in this
    case.  In this regard the Crown relies on
    the following factors:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Loading a firearm is an inherently dangerous
    activity;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Given the circumstances and the appellant’s
    knowledge of Quick’s unstable temperament, the appellant’s loading of a firearm
    was highly reckless;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant was under a firearms prohibition
    at the time of loading the gun;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Wilman was a vulnerable victim;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Wilman had extended the couple kindness by
    taking them into his home;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant’s previous criminal record
    contains two convictions for impaired driving, a conviction for harassment,
    common assault, breach of probation and fail to comply with a recognizance;  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The manner of burying the body was callous and
    disrespectful;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant and Quick took advantage of Wilman
    by stealing his vehicles;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant fled the jurisdiction with Quick
    and helped her disguise herself; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>He feigned surprise when confronted with news of
    Wilman’s death and denied involvement in it, showing lack of remorse for his
    actions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because there is no evidence that the appellant
    actually participated in the killing of Mr. Wilman and he does not have a serious
    related criminal record, we agree with the appellant that the sentence imposed
    was outside the range of sentences for this offence and it is therefore
    unfit.  However, having regard to the
    aggravating factors enumerated by the Crown above, in our opinion a fit
    sentence is a sentence of nine years less the 46 months credit for time served
    granted by the trial judge. <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, leave to appeal sentence is granted, the
    appeal as to sentence is allowed and the sentence is reduced to nine years. </p>
