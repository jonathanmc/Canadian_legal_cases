  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>By The Court:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    1997, the appellants purchased a townhouse built by Southwood Lakes Holdings
    Ltd. and Masterpiece Homes (1977) Ltd. (the “builders”) for $177,000. After
    taking possession of their new home, the appellants noticed dampness on the
    basement floor, which raised concerns about potential drainage problems.
    After investigation, the builders acknowledged that the cement slab in the
    basement did not meet the depth requirement of 3 inches specified in the <i>Ontario
    Building Code</i>, but did not agree with the appellants regarding the alleged
    drainage problem. The issue became how to resolve the problem. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    a series of failed negotiations between the appellants, the builders, the
    respondent Ontario New Home Warranty Plan (the “Plan”), and representatives
    of the City of Windsor, the appellants commenced this action in February,
    2002, claiming general and aggravated damages of $350,000 for breach of contract
    and negligence and $150,000 in punitive damages.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    almost three weeks of trial, the trial judge ordered the builders to pay
    the appellants damages in the amount of $29,700 for breach of the express
    and implied terms of the building contract and for breach of the builders’
    warranty. The trial judge assessed damages on the basis that a reasonable
    course of action would be to treat the basement floor with a specific sealant
    and topping, obtain an engineer<span lang=EN-US>’</span>s certificate confirming
    effective compliance with the <i>Ontario Building Code</i>, re-grade some
    of the lands sloping towards the house, and install clay plugs in the service
    trenches of the sanitation system. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge dismissed the claim against the Plan, finding that the appellants
    refused a reasonable solution offered by the builders despite assurances
    that the new work would enjoy an extended warranty under the <i>Ontario New
    Home Warranties Plan Act </i>(the “Act”).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    appeal, the appellants do not directly challenge the trial judge’s findings
    of fact. Rather, they allege that the trial judge made errors of law that
    affected his perception of the evidence. These errors include the appellants’ arguments
    that the trial judge erred in his application of the principles of mitigation
    by failing to appreciate that the appellants were not required to accept
    a solution that contained a risk of failure; by failing to recognize that
    the proposed solution did not meet the minimum requirements of the <i>Ontario
    Building Code</i>; and by failing to consider that the warranties provided
    by the Act guaranteed that there would be no water penetration for two years. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    support of their argument that the sealant solution impermissibly failed
    to foreclose any risk of recurrence of the dampness, the appellants rely
    in part on two letters written to them early in the dispute by Fabrice Forte
    to the effect that the sealant would not work. However, Mr. Forte testified
    at trial that the sealant would work. Mr. Forte explained the content of
    his earlier letters to the appellants, and his refusal to provide them with
    a quote or guarantee about the sealant solution, on the basis that he did
    not want to be involved with Mr. Dinsmore. The trial judge accepted Mr. Forte’s
    explanation and his evidence that the sealant and topping would provide an
    effective solution. Moreover, there was other expert evidence that the sealant
    solution would solve the problem.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the appellants’ other challenges about the
    “risk” factor, including the evidence about the neighbour’s attempts with
    a sealant, also amount to no more than challenges to the trial judge’s factual
    findings. In our view, the trial judge’s factual findings were supported
    by the evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants also argued that the sealant solution was unacceptable because
    it did not result in a slab that was 3 inches thick, exclusive of the topping,
    or meet the <i>Ontario Building Code</i> requirements for drainage. However,
    the City undertook a complete investigation of the drainage and was satisfied
    that it complied. It was also satisfied that the proposed sealant and topping
    provided satisfactory and substantial compliance with the <i>Ontario Building
    Code</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the trial judge did not fail to consider the warranties provided by the Act.
    He found the builders liable in part based on breach of those warranties.
    In fact, the builders admitted such liability. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Next,
    we see no error in the trial judge’s approach to the liability of the Plan.
    The trial judge found that the builders were prepared throughout to implement
    a remedy recommended by their experts as well as those of the City and the
    Plan. The appellants refused to implement that remedy or allow entry so that
    the work could be done. The appellants continued to withhold their approval
    despite the assurance that the work would enjoy an extended warranty under
    the Plan. In these circumstances, we agree with the trial judge that ss.
    14(2) and (3) of the Act provide the Plan with an answer to the appellants’ claim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants raised two objections with respect to the trial judge’s award
    of damages. First, they claim that the trial judge erred in failing to award
    general and non pecuniary damages for interference with lifestyle and for
    loss of enjoyment of life. We disagree. The trial judge found as a fact that
    any such damages suffered by the appellants were minimal and that, in any
    event, the appellants’ actions contributed to any such damages. We see no
    basis to interfere with these findings. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants also argued that the trial judge erred in failing to include in
    the damage award the full amount of the fees and disbursements for the experts
    retained by the appellants. We so no error in the trial judge limiting the
    amount of this award to the investigative pre-litigation expenses. The trial
    judge took the balance of the experts’ fees into account in his costs award. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    we do not accept the appellants’ ground of appeal regarding the detail sheet.
    The appellants failed to establish at trial that this document related to
    the specifications for their home. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    builders cross-appealed the trial judge’s costs award, arguing that the trial
    judge erred in failing to take into consideration the appellants’ election
    not to proceed under the simplified rules procedure and the respondents'
    offers to settle. The trial judge considered each of these matters. We see
    no error in his decision that neither point dictated a different result. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    we would dismiss the appeal and cross-appeal. We direct that the appellants
    pay the respondent builders’ costs fixed in the amount of $15,000 and the
    costs of the respondent Plan in the amount of $6,500, both amounts inclusive
    of disbursements and G.S.T. </p>
