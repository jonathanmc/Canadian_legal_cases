  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    a decision released on May 20, 2008, this court allowed the appeal of the
    defendant Hudson’s Bay Company (“HBC”) and dismissed the cross-appeal of
    the representative plaintiffs Peter Christopher Burke, Richard Fallis and
    A. Douglas Ross (the “Representative Plaintiffs”).  The court indicated that
    if the parties were unable to reach agreement on the matter of costs, they
    were to make brief submissions on the same.  As agreement was not reached,
    the parties filed written submissions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    its original costs submissions, HBC submitted that the litigation had been
    adversarial in nature and that had the Representative Plaintiffs been successful,
    there would have been no benefit for the tens of thousands of HBC employees
    who remained in the HBC pension plan.  Thus, it argued, the usual rules of
    civil procedure should apply in determining costs.  Accordingly, as the successful
    party, it sought costs on a partial indemnity basis, payable directly by
    the Representative Plaintiffs in their personal capacity, and not from the
    pension fund (the “Fund”).  On that basis, HBC requested costs of approximately
    $690,000.00.  This consisted of trial costs of approximately $579,000, and
    costs of the appeal and cross-appeal of approximately $112,000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Representative Plaintiffs submitted that the costs of both parties should
    be paid from the Fund on a substantial indemnity basis or, alternatively,
    that each side should bear its own costs.  If an order of costs were to be
    made against the Representative Plaintiffs, they argued that the quantum
    sought by HBC was excessive.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    court considered the parties’ costs submissions and made a preliminary determination
    that costs of both sides should be paid from the Fund (the “Preliminary Determination”).  The
    court advised the parties of its Preliminary Determination and asked for
    further submissions as to the appropriate scale and quantum of such costs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    parties filed supplemental submissions.  In these submissions, the court
    was advised that in light of its Preliminary Determination, the parties had
    agreed that they should recover their respective costs on a full indemnity
    basis from the Fund.  However, this agreement was contingent on the understanding
    that it was without prejudice to HBC’s right to appeal the Preliminary Determination,
    should HBC decide to take that step.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

    its supplemental submissions, HBC states that it has incurred legal fees
    and disbursements of $2,509,071.79 in relation to this matter since 1994.  Of
    that sum, $1,415,363.82 has already been paid out of the Fund.  For convenience,
    hereafter I will refer to HBC’s total legal fees and disbursements as $2.5
    million and the amount of the fees and disbursements already paid from the
    Fund as $1.4 million.    </p>

    order dated January 13, 2004, Ground J. ordered that both parties to the
    litigation were to be responsible for their own costs in prosecuting the
    action through to trial, subject to further court order (the
    “Ground order”).  In the course of preparing its supplemental submissions,
    HBC discovered that of the $1.4 million that has been paid from the Fund,
    approximately $685,000 of that sum was paid between the date of the Ground
    order and the conclusion of trial.  Some of those legal expenses had been
    paid directly from the Fund and others had been paid by HBC but HBC had subsequently
    been reimbursed from the Fund.  All payments made from the Fund after the
    Ground order were as a result of inadvertence.  Relying on the pension plan
    documentation, HBC argued that but for the terms of the Ground order, the
    expenses were permissibly paid from the Fund.  </p>

    asks for an order for costs of slightly in excess of $1 million from the
    Fund, which is the balance owing for fees and disbursements on a full indemnity
    basis.  It also asks for a declaration approving the $1.4 million of prior
    payments made out of the Fund on account of legal fees and disbursements. </p>

    its supplemental submissions, the Representative Plaintiffs seek an order
    for costs payable from the Fund of $363,224.85.  This consists of approximately
    $43,000 for the appeal and cross-appeal, and approximately $320,000 for the
    trial costs.  These sums do not include costs that have already been paid
    from the Fund pursuant to prior court orders.  The Representative Plaintiffs
    take no issue with, and raise no objection to, certain of HBC’s fees having
    already been paid from the Fund.  Counsel for the Representative Plaintiffs
    fully accepts that the payments were made through inadvertence.       </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><u><span lang=EN-US>REASONS FOR THE PRELIMINARY
        DETERMINATION </span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Kerry
      (
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    ) Inc. v.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario (Superintendent of Financial Services)</i> (2007), 282 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>)
    625, at paras. 10-12, this court explained that public policy dictates that
    costs are to be made payable from a pension fund in two categories of cases.  Those
    two categories are where the proceedings are brought: (1) to ensure the due
    administration of the pension trust fund; or (2) for the benefit of all of
    the beneficiaries.  Apart from those two categories of cases, the usual costs
    rules of civil litigation should apply.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the present case falls squarely within the first category and, as
    explained more fully below, within the spirit of the second.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    advancing this case, the Representative Plaintiffs sought to determine whether
    HBC, as an employer who terminated the employment of a significant number
    of employees through sale of a part of its business (the “Transferred Employees”),
    was obliged to administer its ongoing pension plan in a way that recognized
    the contributions made by the Transferred Employees to the surplus funds
    in its ongoing pension plan.  The legal issues were novel in a number of
    respects including the appropriate division of actuarial surplus, given that
    the Transferred Employees had been transferred to a successor pension plan
    and assets sufficient to meet accrued liabilities had been transferred to
    the successor plan but no pension plan wind-up (whole or in part) had been
    ordered.     <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    in substance, the litigation was aimed at ensuring the proper administration
    of trust funds in an ongoing pension plan.  The problem was created by ambiguities
    in the plan documentation.  It required extensive interpretation of documents
    and the determination of a number of novel legal questions.  The core issue
    that divided the parties was real and there was significant merit to both
    sides.  Furthermore, in a very real sense, this case was about surplus entitlement
    and, historically, costs in surplus cases have been awarded from the fund.<a
href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a> This consideration is even more pronounced in
    the present case, as there was no other way in which surplus entitlement
    could have been decided.  The Transferred Employees raised the issue of surplus
    in the proceedings before the Superintendent of the Pension Commission of
    Ontario but the Superintendent decided that he had no jurisdiction to deal
    with the issue and that it should be dealt with by the courts.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>    As
    mentioned, I also see this case as falling within the spirit of the second
    category.  Had the Representative Plaintiffs been successful, the result
    would have been of benefit to all of the Transferred Employees.  That is
    very different from the situation in <i>Kerry </i>where it was unclear what
    level of support the plaintiffs had from plan members and, had the plaintiffs
    been successful, the benefit would have gone to only a particular class of
    members.     <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    there is a question of fairness that is properly addressed through costs.  It
    is clear that the direct contributions deducted from the Transferred Employees’
    pay, together with the additional contributions made by HBC in relation to
    those employees, contributed to the surplus which had accumulated in the
    Fund at the time of the Northern Stores sale.  The 1200 Transferred Employees
    were involuntarily removed from the Fund by reason of transfer to the new
    employer.  They had no say in the sale agreement or division of plan assets.  It
    is a just result that some of the surplus funds be used to resolve a very
    legitimate and reasonable debate over entitlement to that surplus.  <i></i></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><u><span lang=EN-US>THE SCALE OF COSTS</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the parties agreed between themselves that full indemnity was the proper
    scale on which to award costs, no submissions were made on this point apart
    from reference to this court’s recent decision in <i>MacKinnon v. Ontario
    Municipal Employees Retirement Board </i>(2007), 88 O.R. (3d) 269.  In <i>MacKinnon </i>at
    para. 91, this court ordered certain costs (but not all) in a pension dispute
    payable on a full indemnity basis from the pension fund.  <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons already given, the court is satisfied that, in principle, full
    indemnity costs are warranted in the circumstances of this case.  However,
    it is important to note the strictures on such a costs award that were identified
    in <i>MacKinnon</i>.  At para. 92, after ordering costs on a full indemnity
    basis, this court stated that it did not wish to be taken as suggesting there
    were no “checks and balances” on such costs awards and that “[a]t a minimum,
    such costs are to be reviewed by the court and are limited to those that
    have been reasonably incurred.”  <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would reiterate those admonitions here.  It is important to keep in mind
    that pension funds, although held in trust, operate differently from other
    trust funds.  For example, in estate litigation, there are generally parties
    who have the right to scrutinize expenses being charged to the estate.  Those
    people provide “checks and balances”, both in the courtroom and outside,
    in addition to those provided by the court.  As pension plan members generally
    have limited (or no) ability to scrutinize or challenge expenditures from
    the pension fund, similar checks and balances may not exist in respect of
    pension trusts.  Accordingly, even when a court has determined that costs
    should be payable from a pension fund on a full indemnity basis, the court
    must take steps to satisfy itself of the reasonableness of such costs.     <i></i></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><u><span lang=EN-US>QUANTUM OF COSTS</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    a full indemnity basis, HBC is seeking costs of $280,000 for the appeal and
    cross-appeal, and approximately $2.23 million for the balance of the proceedings.  As
    has been mentioned, the Representative Plaintiffs seek full indemnity costs
    of $43,000 for the appeal and cross-appeal, and $320,000 for the balance
    of the proceedings.  The costs of the Representative Plaintiffs for the proceedings
    apart from the appeal and cross-appeal do not include costs that have been
    paid already pursuant to prior court orders.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    court is obviously well-positioned to consider the reasonableness of the
    costs of the appeal and cross-appeal.  Those sought by the Representative
    Plaintiffs meet such a test and I would so order.  In my view, however, the
    amounts sought by HBC are excessive.  After allowing for the fact that the
    costs of an appellant are higher and keeping in mind the Rule 57.01 factors,
    I would order costs to the appellant of $140,000 for the appeal and cross-appeal,
    payable from the Fund.  In arriving at this figure, I am mindful of the following
    consideration: that this was a one-day appeal, the same counsel appeared
    both at trial and on appeal, the amount sought on a partial indemnity basis
    and the amount awarded opposing counsel on a full indemnity basis.  All of
    these considerations are made in the context of an appreciation of the usual
    range of costs awarded on appeal.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, however, this court is not in a position to properly consider the
    reasonableness of the costs sought in relation to the balance of the proceedings,
    including the trial.  As I will explain, a determination as to the reasonableness
    of the costs of these proceedings, apart from those associated with the appeal
    and cross-appeal, is best left to the trial judge.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>   First,
    it goes without saying that the trial judge is uniquely positioned to determine
    the reasonableness of the trial costs.  This court does not have the benefit
    of a costs decision from the trial judge because that matter was to be addressed
    following the conclusion of the remedies hearing.  However, the remedies
    hearing did not take place as it was overtaken by this appeal and cross-appeal.  <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the costs are very large and differ significantly between the parties.  I
    recognise that I am comparing “apples and oranges” in making that statement
    because the costs sought by the Representative Plaintiffs for the proceedings
    (apart from the costs of the appeal and cross-appeal) do not include costs
    already paid from the Fund pursuant to prior court orders whereas the figure
    advanced by HBC represents the full costs of those proceedings.  Further,
    I understand that HBC has borne sole responsibility for many expensive aspects
    of these proceedings, including the production of thousands of documents,
    unusual and extensive cross-examinations and examinations for discovery,
    and the extensive actuarial and other expert evidence.  At the same time,
    however, the costs submissions before the court are, of necessity, little
    more than summaries of the work that went into this complicated and lengthy
    case.  In the circumstances, this court cannot review the costs in any meaningful
    way.    <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    counsel for the parties have indicated that they have no objection to this
    matter being decided by the trial judge.  <i></i></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><u><span lang=EN-US>DISPOSITION</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I would order that costs of the appeal and cross-appeal, fixed at $140,000,
    be paid to HBC from the Fund and that costs of the appeal and cross-appeal,
    fixed at $43,000, be paid to the Representative Plaintiffs from the Fund.  Further,
    I would order that both parties are entitled to their costs of the balance
    of the proceedings payable from the Fund on a full indemnity basis, so long
    as such costs meet the test of reasonableness.  For the reasons already given,
    I would refer that matter to the trial judge to be decided in accordance
    with these reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would decline to make the declaration requested by HBC in respect of the
    prior payment of fees to it from the Fund.  Although the Representative Plaintiffs
    took no objection to those payments, being fully satisfied that they were
    made through inadvertence, in my view this court is not in a position to
    make the requested declaration.  The primary task of the court at this time
    is to fix the costs of the appeal and cross-appeal.  In light of the result
    on appeal, this court was obliged to consider also the matter of trial costs.  The
    requested declaration goes beyond the scope of such matters.  Even if the
    court has jurisdiction to make the requested declaration, in my view it would
    be inadvisable to do so.       </p>
