      a handgun.</span></p>

      several days prior to January 3, 2003, Prieto repeatedly accused Attard

      between the two men about Attard’s indiscretions, “Let’s go dump the Russians.
      Let’s go brother”, or something like that. Almarales denied ever having
      made such a remark.</span></p>

      and Attard came to Almarales’ place to pick up Prieto’s possessions. Prieto
      then accused Attard of being sexually intimate with Almarales. Attard’s
      denial further angered Prieto who had told Attard earlier that he wanted
      to kill Almarales.</span></p>

      which he pressed against Almarales’ cheek, and said “don’t fucking lie … give
      me a reason why I don’t blow your head off.”  Almarales told Prieto to
      calm down and denied his friend’s accusations. Something seemed to be wrong

    that Vladimirski also expected Denys Khomovych to come by to help Vassiliev
    move his (Vassiliev’s) girlfriend’s things into the apartment.</span></p>

      to Vladimirski, Almarales swung a cup at Vladimirski’s face as Prieto,
      Almarales and he sat at the dining room table. Prieto then punched Vladimirski,
      ordered him down on the floor, and began to beat and kick him. Almarales
      came up from behind Vladimirski, put a bread knife to his throat, and asked
      Prieto
    “let me cut his throat”. Prieto responded: “okay … let me get the duct tape”.
    As Prieto searched for duct tape, Vladimirski took the bread knife away from
    Almarales, who made no effort to resist. Almarales did not pursue Vladimirski,
    say anything to him, or assault Vladimirski further.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Vladimirski
      ran to the kitchen where he was confronted by Prieto, who was brandishing
      his handgun. Prieto accused both Vladimirski and Vassiliev of having had
      sex with Attard on December 24, 2002. Vladimirski denied the allegations
      and suggested that Vassiliev’s girlfriend looked like Attard. Prieto noticed
      blood on a mattress in the bedroom as he and Vladimirski searched the room
      for a photograph of Vassiliev’s girlfriend. Prieto told Almarales to cut
      off a piece of the mattress for DNA testing. Almarales complied and returned
      to the living room couch, a knife and small knife sharpener in his hands.
      Prieto ordered both Vladimirski and Almarales around.</span></p>

      knocked at the apartment door. At Prieto’s direction, Almarales turned
      off the lights and opened the door. Both Almarales and Prieto ordered Khomovych
      to lie down on the living room floor, face down with his hands behind his
      back. Khomovych did so, lying beside Vladimirski who was in the same position.
      Prieto spoke to Khomovych in a friendlier voice as he inquired about Khomovych’s
      knowledge of Vassiliev’s and Vladimirski’s relationships with Attard and
      their use of crack cocaine.</span></p>

      short time later, Vassiliev arrived at the apartment, entered, and turned
      on the lights. Prieto immediately pointed his gun at Vassiliev and ordered
      him to lie face down on the living room floor with his hands behind his
      back, like the others. Vassiliev did so. Prieto became angrier as he confronted
      Vassiliev about his (Vassiliev’s) involvement with Attard. Vassiliev denied
      any impropriety.</span></p>

      to Vladimirski, Prieto said “I want to go homicidal on these three”, then
      told Almarales to turn up the volume on the stereo and to hold Vassiliev.
      Vladimirski did not see what Almarales did with Vassiliev. Prieto shot
      Vassiliev first, then Vladimirski, who shortly lost consciousness. Vladimirski
      did not see what happened to Khomovych. When Vladimirski awakened, he saw
      Vassiliev lying in a pool of blood on the floor, but there was no sign
      of Khomovych.</span></p>

      to Almarales, Prieto asked Vladimirski about Vassiliev’s whereabouts as
      soon as Vladimirski admitted Almarales and Prieto to the apartment. When
      advised that Vassiliev would be back in about 20 minutes, Prieto began
      his allegations of illicit sexual activities by both men with Attard. Prieto
      followed his allegations by punching Vladimirski in the face, knocking
      him to the floor. Despite Vladimirski’s denials, Prieto continued the assault
      and ordered the appellant to get a knife and hold it against Vladimirski’s
      throat. The appellant did as he was told. Prieto left the room. Vladimirski
      grabbed the knife. The appellant let the knife go and Vladimirski ran to
      the kitchen. There, Vladimirski encountered Prieto armed with a handgun.
      Prieto ordered Vladimirski back into the living room and directed him to

      forced him to the floor, accused him of having had sex with Attard, then
      began to kick and punch his former roommate. Vassiliev resisted. The appellant

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>There is no legal requirement

      trial judge next explained the essential elements of constructive first
      degree murder under s. 231(5)(e). He instructed the jury:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>It can also be first degree murder
      where a person causes the death of a human being while committing or attempting
      to commit certain offences, one of which is forcible confinement, <i>whether
      or not the person means to cause death</i>, if he means to cause bodily
      harm for the purpose of facilitating the offence of forcible confinement
      and death ensues as a consequence. Unlawful or forcible confinement is
      the intentional confining of another person; to physically restrain the
      person, contrary to their wishes, thereby depriving that person of their
      liberty to move from one place to another. Confinement is the unlawful
      restriction on liberty for some period of time. There is no suggestion
      here that the confinement of these three people was lawful; in fact it
      may be conceded that the acts of Mr. Almarales had the effect of confining
      Vladimirski and Vassiliev – knife to the throat of Vladimirski;  he held
      Vassiliev to prevent him from grabbing Prieto’s feet when Prieto was kicking
      him – and that these actions were unlawful.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>            In the case of a party
      or a participant in the first degree murder, one who does not do the actual
      killing where forcible confinement is proven beyond a reasonable doubt,
      the Crown must satisfy you beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Almarales
      participated in such a manner that it can fairly be said that his actions
      were a substantial and integral cause of the death of Khomovych and/or
      Vassiliev, for instance. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>

      after this passage, the trial judge reminded the jurors that the crime
      of murder required proof of a specific state of mind. He then elucidated
      for the jurors the state of mind to be proven to establish liability “as
      a party”:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>            The crime of murder
      requires proof of a particular state of mind or intention. For an unlawful
      killing to be murder, the Crown must prove that Almarales as a party either
      meant to kill or meant to cause bodily harm that Almarales knew was likely
      to kill and was reckless whether the victims died or not. The Crown does
      not have to prove both
    – one is enough. All of you do not have to agree on the same state of mind
    or intention, as long as everyone is sure that one of the required states
    of mind has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt. If Almarales as a party
    did not mean to do either, but intended to commit an unlawful act that resulted
    in death, then Almarales may have then committed manslaughter.</span></p>

      judge continued:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>            As a party did Almarales
      know that Prieto’s acts were to be inherently dangerous and were going
      to be such that a reasonable person in the circumstances would have foreseen
      that Khomovych and Vassiliev might suffer harm that would be neither trivial
      or transitory as a consequence of Prieto’s actions?  Or did Almarales intend
      to commit an unlawful act from which death flowed?  If you are not satisfied
      beyond a reasonable doubt that Almarales as a party had either state of
      mind required to make his unlawful killings of the victims murder, you
      may find him guilty of manslaughter if you find beyond a reasonable doubt
      that as a party he committed an unlawful act that resulted in death.</span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Sir please review the attached
      flowchart. A number of individuals are hung up with the flow of page two – page
      two of three of the decision tree. Would the following also be correct:
      Intent plus pre-plan equals first degree; intent plus forcible confinement
      equals first degree; intent only equals second degree; no intent but death
      happens, manslaughter; no intent, no death happens, not guilty of charge?  By
      intent above this is the box commencing ‘as a party would ensue’.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-US>The trial judge responded:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Now I think we know what you mean

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Intent only equals second degree – yes.
      No intent but death happens – that’s possibly right, but the intent in
      manslaughter is different. The intent – if you’ll flip over the page – for
      manslaughter was knowledge of acts inherently dangerous, or did Almarales

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The next part of it – no intent,
      no death happens, not guilty of charge – is again more complex. We’re only

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>With the assistance of counsel
      again, if I may put it as simply as I can – your flowchart has one error
      on it that counsel have indicated that I can tell you about, and that is
      that when you get down to the manslaughter on page three –
    consider manslaughter – there is no box for ‘no’ ‘not guilty’. It is conceded
    by counsel that provided – and I say ‘provided’ – you get beyond the first
    page

      seems clear from the colloquy that followed that the trial judge provided
      the jurors with an amended copy of a part of his final instructions. The
      trial judge explained:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>I’ve consulted with counsel and
      they have no objections to me giving you a copy of my script. I’m not going
      to give you the whole charge. What I’m going to give you is the substantive
      part, if you wish – it includes the substantive charges of first and second
      degree murder and pretty well all that I’ve said. Now occasionally I slipped
      a word in edgewise, and it has other things like ‘review relevant evidence
      and relate to issue’. Well that’s the judge’s instructions to himself,
      okay. So you won’t pay any intention to that. I don’t have any evidence
      in it at all, except on page 21 I’ve reminded myself of a couple of things
      that we reviewed with you.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Now I made two other amendments,
      counsel, did I not? In attempting to define for you ‘unlawful forcible
      confinement’ I said ‘had the effect of confining’ – and I originally said ‘Vladimirski
      and Vassiliev’ – I inserted in there ‘these three young men’, and I hope
      that that  is – and I’ll make that amendment in my pen right here, if you
      don’t mind.</span></p>

      copy provided to the jurors. Unfortunately, what the jurors received was
      never made a lettered exhibit at the trial. Thus it is not available for

      jurors’ final question and the trial judge’s response occurred within hours
      of the jury’s verdict. The question posed by the jurors was this:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Your Honour, ‘A’ and ‘B’ walk
      into a store and upon seeing a stereo unit decide to steal it. ‘A’ guards
      the door. ‘B’ picks up the stereo, however he also shoots and kills an
      employee in the course of stealing the unit. Is ‘A’ equally guilty as ‘B’?</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-US>The trial judge responded:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Well we’ve been struggling with
      your question and how to answer it, even to the extent of changing a number
      of facts, and that’s where we got bogged down.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>May I say to you that this factual
      situation is one that on this information we can’t answer. For instance,
      there’s no active participation of ‘A’ in respect of a specified offence,
      if you are thinking, for instance, of route two to murder in the first
      degree. Also, as you know, the specified offence that you’re dealing with
      is that of forcible confinement, and you’ll recall that the route two has
      the first large box with respect to participation in a manner that can
      be said that it was a substantial integral cause of death. And then you
      go on then to the second and third boxes of questioning, and on this scenario
      we can’t even guess how to change that to – we can, but we can’t agree
      on how it might be done.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>So we’re not very helpful to you.
      That being said, again route two, if that’s what you’re thinking of, requires
      murder in the course of a specified offence –
    forcible confinement – and if  you read down the boxes maybe that will help
    again. Otherwise the 12 of you may be able to think of a different scenario
    that would be impossible for us to answer.</span></p>

      you unduly. Thank you for your patience.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First,
      the preparation of final instructions, as well decision trees and other
      jury aids, is the responsibility of the trial judge. While the trial judge
      is entitled to seek and obtain the assistance of counsel in settling upon
      the form and content of final (or any) instructions, there should be no
      delegation of drafting responsibility to counsel such as occurred here. </span></p>

      in response to a request from the jury, the trial judge provided a copy
      of his
    “script” of legal instructions to the jury. It seems clear from the trial
    transcript that the trial judge made some amendments to his original instructions.
    Unfortunately, no one filed as lettered exhibits, the written instructions

    ), which emphasizes the need for a permanent record of written materials
    discussed with counsel and provided to jurors, to permit meaningful appellate
    review. In light of <i>McNeil</i>, it is absolutely essential that draft
    instructions discussed with counsel, written final instructions and deliberation
    aids, be filed as lettered exhibits and made part of the trial record to
    permit meaningful appellate review.</span></p>

      the method or approach the trial judge follows in informing jurors about
      the issues that require their decision at the end of a trial is left largely
      to the discretion of the presiding judge. There is no sacred formula. Substance
      triumphs over form. Yet some approaches are more apt to facilitate juror
      understanding than others.</span></p>

      predominant practice in this province is to separate out the essential
      elements of the offence charged, convert each element to a question, instruct
      the jurors on the legal principles that govern their decision on the question
      including any defence that applies to the issue, review the salient features
      of the evidence relevant to their decision on the question, and leave the
      issue to the jurors for their decision with instructions about its consequences
      for their further deliberations or verdict. The questions are replicated
      in the decision tree provided to jurors. The language used and sequence
      of the questions followed are identical. This method is suitable for both
      principals and secondary participants.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>In most cases of unlawful homicide, whether charged as manslaughter
      or murder, or if murder, whether classified as first degree murder or second

      followed by murder and, when applicable, first degree murder. At each step,
      relevant defences are discussed, for example, alibi (homicide), accident
      and private defence (unlawful homicide), and intoxication (murder). Leaving
      aside the excuse of mental disorder, excuses like duress are better understood
      if they are left for determination until after the jury has decided whether
      the accused committed an offence and, if so, which offence.</span></p>

      as a requirement that in cases of unlawful homicide a particular formula
      should be followed in final instructions, failing which appellate reversal
      will follow. To hold otherwise would substitute form for substance and
      ignore decades of precedent. That said, an orderly approach involving a
      series of sequential steps is more apt to facilitate juror understanding
      than a haphazard accumulation.</span></p>

      it for you, at the time of the crimes. It may help you in deciding what
      the accused’s state of mind was at the time the offences took place; his
      relationship to Mr. Prieto. In other words, it may help you decide Mr.

      or threats to himself or his family. It may reflect some concern of embarrassment
      at the role that he played in the offence, even when he was, as he alleges,
      forced to participate under duress. You have to first decide whether Mr.
      Almarales did these things and of course his own evidence says that he
      did – where he went; what he did to assist Mr. Prieto at the time. Having
      then made your conclusions, if you find that he did those things, then
      you should consider whether this was because he committed the offence,
      or participated in it willingly and his intent was there, or for some other
      reason. If you find that what he did afterwards is consistent with being
      conscious of having done what is alleged against him and not for some other
      reason, then you may consider this evidence together with all the other
      evidence in reaching your verdict. If you do not or cannot find he did
      these things for that reason then you must not consider the evidence in

      duress. In support of that excuse, he introduced evidence about the violent
      and unpredictable disposition of Prieto. The prosecutor was entitled to
      respond to this evidence and did so without objection by the appellant’s
      trial counsel. At the end of the day, the trial judge decided that there
      was an air of reality to the excuse of duress and left that excuse to the

      necessary nor desirable to engage in a forced march through each item of
      evidence adduced in the prosecutorial response. Two brief observations
      are apt, however. The first is that the trial judge did not receive much
      help from counsel conducting the case in curtailing the teem of prejudice
      and ensuring compliance with such fundamental principles as relevance,
      materiality and admissibility. Secondly, much of this evidence was led
      by the appellant’s own counsel at trial, or at least repeated by its introduction
      through the appellant’s own testimony. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>Instructions about the limited use a trier of fact can make of some
      kinds of evidence have two aspects. One is positive, the other negative.
      The positive instruction tells jurors, in permissive language, the use
      they may make of the evidence. Permitted use. Permissive terms. The negative
      instruction tells jurors, in mandatory terms, the use that they must not

      not use the evidence to conclude or help it conclude that the appellant
      was the sort of person who would commit the offences charged. Some of the
      inherent prejudice curtailed by this negative instruction was allowed to
      seep back in because of the lack of specifics in the direction about the
      permitted use. It is unnecessary to decide whether, if this omission stood
      alone, it would require a new trial. </span></p>

      first degree murder and attempted murder – are inconsistent with the verdict
      that he does not contest –  the conviction of manslaughter. The three shootings
      were all part of a piece. The same shooter, fueled by the same emotions,
      shot three persons in short order as part of a single plan. First degree
      murder and attempted murder require proof of an intent to kill. Manslaughter
      is an unlawful, but unintentional killing, and there is no basis upon which
      to distinguish the shooting of Khomovych from the other two shootings.
      Hence, the appellant says, it was inconsistent for the jury to return verdicts
      of guilty of first degree murder and attempted murder on two counts and
      of manslaughter on the other. </span></p>

      others in a moving project. He didn’t live in the apartment, nor was he
      part of “let’s dump the Russians” comment attributed to the appellant earlier.
      Prieto acted differently towards Khomovych, speaking to him in conciliatory
      terms, the antithesis of his attitude towards the others. The circumstances
      of Khomovych’s confinement differed in kind from those of the others, likewise

      and 231(5)(e). It follows that the parties and the jury were entitled to
      complete and accurate instructions on what the prosecutor was required

      a significant error. Moreover, the elements of constructive first degree
      murder were never fully articulated, and what was said contained a fundamental
      misdirection, namely, that this basis for first degree murder could be
      proven “whether or not the person means to cause death, if he means to
      cause bodily harm for the purpose of facilitating the offence of forcible
      confinement and death ensues as a consequence.”</span></p>

      to review the essential features of the evidence and relate it to the issues
      on which the appellant’s liability turned if the jurors rejected duress,
      as seemed likely on the evidence adduced at trial. The number and nature

      was left somewhat vague, although it is debatable whether further instructions
      would have enured to the benefit of the appellant. See, for example, <i>R.

lang=EN-US>First, the prosecution’s case against the appellant was that he was
      a secondary participant in the shootings of January 3, 2003. He had no
      gun. He fired no shots. His responsibility, as determined by the jury,
      was as a secondary participant in an unlawful killing that was not murder.
      Yet, in the following passage, the trial judge appears to characterize
      the appellant as a principal:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>My own view that the participation

lang=EN-US>[141]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The jury found the appellant guilty of manslaughter as a secondary
      participant. The case against the appellant was never left to the jury
      on the basis that he was a principal. He was entitled to be sentenced as
      a secondary participant, <i>not</i> as a principal of which there was no

lang=EN-US>Second, prior to sentence, the appellant had been in custody for about
      21 months. Yet the trial judge made no mention of the time spent in custody
      prior to sentence in imposing the discretionary sentences for manslaughter
      and attempted murder. It may well be that the trial judge considered time
      spent in custody to be academic in light of the mandatory sentence for
      first degree murder and the provisions of s. 746(a) of the <i>Criminal

lang=EN-US>Section 719(3) permits but does not require a sentencing judge to
      take into account, in determining a fit sentence, the time the offender
      has spent in custody “as a result of the offence”. While reasonable people

      principles of sentence to this appellant and his offence supports the imposition
      of a substantial penitentiary sentence for the manslaughter conviction,
      the sentence imposed –  20 years – is beyond the range of sentence imposed
      on secondary participants in manslaughter cases. Indeed, few persons convicted
