line-height:normal;'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants are estate trustees of the aunt of one of the parties to a family
    law action, who seek to set aside the family law trial judgment that was
    confirmed on appeal in December, 2006, on the basis that had the estate been
    represented at the trial, it would have asserted an interest in the matrimonial
    home. The motion judge refused to set aside the judgment. For the reasons
    that follow, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Facts</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants are the trustees of the estate of Elizabeth Gilbert, who held
    the subject property as joint tenant with her nephew David Gilbert. The property
    was purchased in 1995 for $125,000, with $10,000 down ($5,000 contributed
    by Kellie Warren and $5,000 by David Gilbert). By the time of the family
    law trial, the property was worth over $2,000,000 and, Elizabeth Gilbert
    having died, her interest had passed by right of survivorship to David. At
    the trial, Kellie Warren was awarded a one-half interest in the property
    by way of resulting trust.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    the trial, Elizabeth Gilbert had been made a party to the family law proceedings
    between David Gilbert and Kellie Warren because she was a joint tenant on
    title to the property, which was both a farm and the matrimonial home of
    David and Kellie. She filed an answer and an affidavit which stated her position
    that she held the property as joint tenant with David Gilbert, she was a
    beneficial owner of her half of the property and not a bare trustee, and
    she had made some financial contribution to the upkeep of the property. She
    disputed that Kellie Warren was entitled to any interest in the property. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Elizabeth
    Gilbert was originally represented by two successive lawyers, but later acted
    on her own. At no time did she sever the joint tenancy as she could have.
    This was consistent with her intent that by virtue of the joint tenancy,
    David would eventually have the whole property by right of survivorship when
    she died. She had no will and, on an intestacy, those entitled were her two
    brothers, William and George, (and possibly her common law spouse), but not
    her nephew, David, William’s son.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the family law trial, counsel for Kellie Warren told the trial judge that
    Elizabeth Gilbert had died and that David Gilbert was the sole owner of the
    property by right of survivorship. Counsel for Kellie Warren also told the
    trial judge that Elizabeth Gilbert had a claim in the litigation that she
    had abandoned and which had not been pursued by the estate. David Gilbert’s
    lawyer did not seek to take any issue with these statements. He took the
    position that although David was the sole owner of the property by right
    of survivorship because
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Elizabeth had died, the best case for Kellie was a claim to ½ of ½ of the
    property because of
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Elizabeth’s joint interest while she was alive. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>David’s
    father, William Gilbert, testified at the trial on behalf of his son David.
    He and his brother George Gilbert were at that time looking for a will by
    their sister. When no will was found, the brothers took out letters of administration
    and became estate trustees. This was done several months after the trial
    judgment had been rendered and four months before David’s appeal of that
    judgment was heard by this court in December, 2006.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>William
    Gilbert attended that appeal hearing. The estate trustees made no attempt
    to intervene in that appeal or to seek any right or status for the estate
    at that appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    was only after this court had dismissed David’s appeal on December 18, 2006
    that the estate trustees brought the motion below, asserting an interest
    in the property for the first time. They did so by seeking to reopen the
    family law proceeding on the basis that the rights of a party who had died
    before trial had been determined without notice to the estate and without
    affording it an opportunity to participate in the proceeding, with the result
    that the judgment could not bind the estate. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge dismissed the motion on three bases. First, he found that the
    estate was not prejudiced because it can still claim against David for its
    share of his half of the property. The motion judge concluded that MacDougall
    J., the judge at the family law trial, had determined that Kellie was entitled
    to half of the whole property, no matter who owned it on title<i>. </i>However,
    that finding was in part a factual finding by MacDougall&nbsp;J. based on
    the record before him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second basis was that William Gilbert, one of the estate trustees and David’s
    father, was well aware of all the facts and circumstances throughout the
    entire period of the litigation and could have raised them at the trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    third basis was that Elizabeth Gilbert took no steps to sever the joint tenancy
    during her life. It was her wish that the property pass to David, as it did.
    It was not her wish to sever the joint tenancy and have her interest in the
    property devolve to her beneficiaries under an intestacy.</p>

    person who should have been made a party to a proceeding but who received
    no notice of the proceeding can seek to have the proceeding reopened if the

    trustees did not move in a timely manner to assert any rights on behalf of
    the estate. Once appointed, they did not seek to assert any position on behalf
    of the estate in the appeal of the trial judgment, despite the fact that
    they were fully aware of that appeal, that the subject matter of that appeal
    was primarily the property that formed the most valuable potential asset
    in the estate, and despite having been appointed estate trustees four months
    before the appeal was heard. William Gilbert says this is because he did
    not know until after the appeal was decided that the estate had a legal argument
    that the joint tenancy was effectively severed in law by the circumstances
    of the purchase, use and ownership of the property by David and Kellie, and
    on that basis there was an argument that David may not have become owner
    of the entire property upon Elizabeth’s death by right of survivorship.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> William
    Gilbert was not cross-examined on his affidavit. Nevertheless, even accepting
    this statement as unchallenged, in my view, the reason he relies on is not
    sufficient to reopen the case. Trustees, once appointed, have an obligation
    to secure the assets of the estate: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left'>A new trustee should forthwith acquaint himself with the nature and particular
    circumstances of the trust property, and should take such steps as may be
    necessary for its due protection. John Mowbray et al., <i>Lewin on Trusts</i>,
    18<sup>th</sup> ed. (
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    London: Sweet&amp; Maxwell, 2008).</p>
  <p align=left style='text-align:left'>It is clear that the trustees understood
    this obligation. They plead in their Statement of Claim that they took such
    steps and that they did so following
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Elizabeth’s death and before they were appointed as trustees of the estate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the main “asset” of the estate was its potential claim to an interest
    in this property, valued at approximately $2,000,000, as the value of the
    deceased’s other assets was $50,000. In their Statement of Claim in this
    proceeding, the estate trustees plead at para. 32, that while they were looking
    for a will of Elizabeth Gilbert (before they were appointed estate trustees)
    they also “undertook action to secure property left by Elizabeth Anne Gilbert,
    including important papers relating to issues pertaining to the subject property,
    pending the formal appointment of Estate Trustees to administer her estate.” These “papers” include
    handwritten notes and draft letters that Rouleau J.A. refers to in his reasons.
    And at para.40 of the Statement of Claim, they plead that: “After the death
    of Elizabeth Gilbert her estate, by the plaintiffs as Estate Trustees, remitted
    payments relating to carrying costs pertaining to the subject property, including,
    without limitation, payment on account of the First Mortgage in favour of
    FCC, Second Mortgage in favour of Gorill, property taxes and insurance premiums.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Clearly,
    based on these actions by the trustees, following the death of Elizabeth
    Gilbert, and both before and after their appointment as estate trustees,
    they saw this property as the main “asset” of the estate and were taking
    steps to preserve it for the estate. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    protecting the assets of the estate, the trustee must act not only honestly,
    but also reasonably: <i>Trost v. Cook</i>, [1920] 48 O.L.R. 278 at para.16.  Since
    the property was still the subject of litigation when the trustees were appointed,
    it was incumbent on the estate trustees to seek timely advice to determine
    whether and how they could assert any interest of the estate in the property
    in the ongoing litigation, and to take those steps in a timely way.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the trustees were not yet appointed at the time of the family law trial,
    they were in place long before the appeal of that judgment. The inference
    drawn by the motion judge that William Gilbert chose to wait for the outcome
    of the appeal and took steps to assert a claim by the estate only after his
    son David Gilbert lost the appeal, is an irresistible one.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, where the trustees sat on their potential claim while the case was <i>sub
    judice</i>, they do not meet the first criterion for reopening a completed
    proceeding. </p>
  <p align=left style='text-align:left'>(2)       <i>The potential merit of the
      estate’s claim that the joint tenancy was severed                                     during
      the life of the Elizabeth Gilbert.</i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    also agree with the motion judge regarding the justice of the claim by the
    estate. The question whether Elizabeth’s handwritten notes, referred to by
    Rouleau J.A., would have been sufficient for her to successfully argue that
    the joint tenancy was severed while she was alive is not relevant here, given
    that she never asserted any such position during her lifetime. Had the estate
    appeared at the trial, it would have had to take a position contrary to the
    one taken by
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Elizabeth while she was alive and contrary to David’s position. It would
    have sought a result that severed the joint tenancy retroactively so that
    Elizabeth Gilbert’s interest in the property would devolve to the beneficiaries
    under an intestacy, rather than to David in accordance with
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Elizabeth’s consistent intent. David would have been in opposition to his
    father and uncle because his position was that he was the sole owner of the
    property by right of survivorship. Given his father’s position throughout,
    up until the time David lost the appeal, it is most unlikely that the estate
    would have taken the position at the original trial that it now seeks to
    assert. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    any event, where Elizabeth Gilbert, during her lifetime, affirmed the joint
    tenancy both by the position she took in the litigation and by failing to
    take any step to sever the joint tenancy when she was aware of the litigation
    and of Kellie Warren’s position, I question whether it would have been open
    to a trial judge to allow the estate, on behalf of Elizabeth, to assert that
    without her knowledge and contrary to her intentions, the joint tenancy was
    severed while she was alive by the actions of Kellie Warren, and to thereby
    retroactively reverse the transmission of her interest to David by right
    of survivorship, that had occurred upon her death<i>.. </i></p>

    these reasons, as well as the fact that the trustees effectively sat on their

    have had the benefit of reading the reasons of my colleague, Feldman J.A.  I  reach
    a different conclusion and, for the reasons that follow, would allow the
    appeal and order that the Estate be made a party to the family law proceedings
    between David Gilbert and the respondent Kellie Warren.  I would also set
    aside the judgment of Justice MacDougall in the family law proceeding dated
    May 19, 2006, in so far as it dealt with Elizabeth Gilbert’s interest in
    the

    essence, the issue at the original trial in 2005 before MacDougall J. was
    determining who owned the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Lansdowne Street property.  The trial judge concluded that although David
    and Elizabeth Gilbert were on title as joint tenants, the legal title did
    not reflect the true ownership interests. Rather, David and Elizabeth were
    holding the property in trust.  Having been informed that
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Elizabeth had abandoned her claim to the property, the trial judge found
    that David and Kellie were the beneficiaries of this trust in equal shares.  He
    therefore found each to be an owner of a 50% interest in the property.</p>

    my view, had
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Elizabeth’s Estate been present and participated at trial, it could, at a
    minimum, have argued that it was a beneficiary of the trust.  Further, the
    Estate could have argued that Elizabeth was indeed the owner of a half interest
    in the property and that, even though her interest was nominally held as
    a joint tenant, the conduct of both David and Kellie had the legal effect
    of severing the joint tenancy sometime prior to Elizabeth’s death.  In either
    case, the Estate would own an interest in the property.</p>

    David’s solicitor told the court that he took the “legal position that as
    a result of the death of the joint owner, he is now the legal sole owner

      to the first reason, MacDougall J.’s reasons make clear his finding that,
      from the outset,
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Elizabeth had no interest in the property and was holding it as a trustee.  It
    is only after making this finding that he addressed who, as between Kellie
    and David, were the beneficial owners of the property and in what proportions.  Nothing
    suggests that, had he considered
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City

    Elizabeth’s contribution to the property and concluded that she also had

      respect to the second basis for the motion judge’s decision, whatever information
      William Gilbert had at the time of trial, he had no standing to raise anything
      on behalf of the Estate.  At that point, William did not know if a will
      existed or who the beneficiaries were.  Other than being there for a portion
      as a witness, it is unclear how much of the trial he attended.  As for
      his failure to intervene on the appeal, this was fully explained in his
      affidavit prepared for this motion, which was not challenged by Kellie.  There
      is, therefore, no basis for suggesting that William, on behalf of an Estate
      he did not represent at the time of trial and for which, at the time of
      the appeal, he had only recently been appointed trustee, delayed acting
      until he would see the outcome of the trial and the appeal.  Such an inference
      would be pure speculation.  In addition, there is a second trustee who
      stands to inherit from the estate.  This second trustee does not appear
      to have had any involvement in the trial and had no interest in delaying
      the estate’s intervention until after disposition of David’s appeal.</span></p>

    respondents argue that the appellants should have sought to intervene at
    the appeal, and that their failure to do so precludes their ability to have
    the judgment set aside now.  The evidence does not suggest, however, that
    the trustees could have intervened effectively at the appeal.  Even by the
    time of their motion to have the Estate added as party, the trustees were
    not aware that
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Elizabeth had filed an Answer in the family proceedings, although they presumed
    one had been filed on her behalf.  In those four months, they would have
    had to retain counsel, review the judgment, obtain copies of the trial transcripts,
    and review all of the documents left by
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    is only through doing all of this work that the trustees could have known
    that the trial judge’s critical finding – that Elizabeth did not have a beneficial
    interest in the property – was made without considering Elizabeth’s claim,
    was contrary to Elizabeth’s position, was contrary to much of the documentary
    evidence available, and was made after the judge had been told by Kellie’s
    counsel that there was no evidence to suggest that Elizabeth intended to
    be an owner and that Elizabeth had abandoned her claim. According to the
    trustees’ uncontradicted evidence, it was not until January 2007 that they
    had any idea that
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Elizabeth’s estate may have any valid ownership interest. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    J.A. views the fact that the Estate was making mortgage, tax and insurance
    payments relating to the property as contradicting this assertion and indicating
    that the trustees saw the property as the main asset of the estate even before
    their appointment.  I disagree.  William’s evidence is that
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Elizabeth had been making similar payments during her lifetime, since she
    was a guarantor of the mortgages on the property and David was often unable
    to pay.  When she died, the Estate assumed this obligation. Given the trustees’ uncontradicted
    evidence that they had no idea that the estate may have had a valid ownership
    interest in the property until January 2007, I interpret these payments as
    protecting the Estate rather than demonstrating that they viewed the property
    as its main asset. In short, after taking their position as trustees, William
    and George exercised reasonable diligence in investigating the state of its
    assets and bringing this motion to have the estate made a party to proceedings
    that affected its property interests.</p>

    when weighing the potential prejudice caused by the delay in seeking the
    relief, it is significant, in my view, that Kellie’s solicitor bears some
    of the responsibility for the failure of the Estate to participate in the
    family law trial.  From the transcript, it is apparent that the trial judge
    was concerned about the issue of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Elizabeth’s Estate participating in the trial.  Kellie’s solicitor’s response
    to the trial judge was incorrect and contributed to the trial judge deciding
    the case without input from the Estate.  In that sense Kellie and David,
    to the extent that his solicitor did not correct the information, are authors
    of the unfortunate need to return the matter for a new hearing.</p>

    where a trial proceeds in the absence of an affected party, there is a real
    issue as to whether that party is bound by the result: see <i>Coulson v.
    Secure Holdings Ltd.</i>, [1976] O.J. No. 1459.  As a result, I would not
    give effect to this submission. </p>

    argues that it is apparent from

    Elizabeth’s pleading and her conduct that she was and intended to be an owner
    in joint tenancy with David and was content that the property passed to David
    on her death.  As part of this submission it is suggested that the Estate
    could not take a position contrary to the position taken in

    Elizabeth’s initial pleading.</p>

    I agree that
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Elizabeth originally pleaded that she was a joint tenant, this was a position
    she took in 2003 based on the information she had available to her at that
    time.  It does not follow that because this position was advanced at the
    outset of the proceeding,
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Elizabeth and the Estate were invariably stuck with that position and would
    have been unable to change their position up to and during the trial.</p>

    circumstances change and additional information comes available, a party
    can apply to change its position and its pleadings.  Subsequent to the initial
    pleading filed in 2003, it is apparent from
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Elizabeth’s notes and other materials I have referred to earlier, that
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place

    Elizabeth’s position was changing.  The fact that she was gravely ill for
    some time before her death may well be a factor to consider when viewing
    her conduct subsequent to the initial pleading.  In addition, the death of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Elizabeth resulted in a further significant change of circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My
    colleague questions whether it would have been open to a trial judge to allow
    the Estate on behalf of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Elizabeth to assert that, without
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Elizabeth’s knowledge and contrary to her intentions, the joint tenancy was
    severed while she was alive.  I disagree. This assumes that
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Elizabeth did not, during the period of her illness and prior to her death
    in fact intend to sever the joint tenancy and assumes that David or Kellie,
    through their actions, had not severed the joint tenancy. These are the very
    issues that were not addressed at trial because the Estate did not participate
    and that, if established, may have entitled
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Elizabeth (and after her death the Estate) to a remedy in equity.</p>

line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would, therefore, not conclude that the Estate would inevitably be bound
    by the original pleading and would have been unable to change its position
    had it been present at trial.  It has been made clear in submissions before
    us that, should the matter proceed, the Estate would indeed seek to amend
    the pleading.  Unless some prejudice were shown, the amendment would likely
    be granted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Amending
    the pleading to advance new positions would, however, be of little significance
    if there was no basis upon which the Estate could emerge from a new trial
    with an interest in the property.  This, in reality, is at the core of this
    appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I will explain, in my view there are two potential outcomes that warrant
    consideration at a new trial.  The first assumes that the trial judge’s finding
    that
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Elizabeth held the property in trust will stand, and the second assumes that
    this finding will be set aside. Both of these depend on the court setting
    aside the trial judge’s finding that the Estate had made no contribution
    to the property.  The materials filed in this court suggest that this finding
    may well be set aside, as they show that Elizabeth did make contributions
    to the property both in terms of money and by securing the credit needed
    to fund the purchase.  The precise amount of the contribution has not, at
    this stage, been determined.  This is properly a matter for trial, as is
    the legal effect of such contributions.</p>

    at a new trial, the court concludes that MacDougall J. was correct and that,
    from the outset, David and Elizabeth held the property in trust and not as
    joint tenants, the Estate will then be in a position to argue that MacDougall
    J.’s finding that Elizabeth made no contribution to the property was wrong.  The
    Estate could present evidence and argue that
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Elizabeth, and after her death the Estate, contributed to the acquisition
    and maintenance of the property and are beneficiaries of the trust.  If
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Elizabeth and the Estate contributed to the property, it may well follow
    that the Estate is properly a beneficiary of this trust.  The extent of each
    party’s interest in the trust – David, Kellie and Elizabeth – would then
    be determined. </p>

    the Estate can show that Elizabeth was not holding the property in trust
    for David and Kellie but rather as owner in joint tenancy, then the Estate
    could argue that the joint tenancy was converted to a tenancy in common sometime
    prior to her death.  This would make the Estate owner of a one-half interest
    in the property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    set out earlier, there was some evidence before the motion judge to the effect
    that Elizabeth contributed to the property and suggesting that the joint
    tenancy may have been converted to a tenancy in common, or alternatively
    suggesting that the Estate has an equitable claim to a half interest in the
    property.</p>

    is not for me to determine what evidence can properly be led at a new trial,
    the value of that evidence, or the strength of any claim.  By suggesting
    that the issues sought to be raised by the Estate have some merit, I should
    not be taken as suggesting that the Estate has a strong case.  Rather, I
    mean only that there are issues that can properly be raised by the Estate
    that are not clearly without merit, and that the Estate, through no fault
    of its own, has been unable to have a court rule on.  The fact that a decision
    has already been made, but on an incomplete record and in circumstances as
    I have described, including the judge being provided with incorrect information,
    should not deprive the Estate of an opportunity to make its case.</p>

line-height:normal'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    would be wrong, in my view, to conclude, based on the materials before us,
    that the result of a trial at which the Estate was a full participant would
    invariably have produced the same result as was obtained in their absence.  In
    the course of a trial, positions regularly change and unforeseen outcomes
    frequently occur.  The present case is one where caution dictates that the
    matter be returned to the Superior Court to have those issues raised by the
    Estate properly adjudicated.</p>
