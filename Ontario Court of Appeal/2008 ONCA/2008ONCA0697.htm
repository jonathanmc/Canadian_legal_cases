      Shaffiq Ramji, prescribed Accutane to Dawn Paxton, the mother of the appellant
      child, Jaime Paxton, on the understanding that the mother would not become
      pregnant while taking the drug. The doctor’s understanding was based on
      the fact that the appellant’s father had had a vasectomy 4 ½ years earlier
      that had been successful up to that time. Unfortunately, the vasectomy
      failed just when the Accutane was prescribed and the appellant was conceived.
      She was born with considerable damage caused by the Accutane and she sued
      the respondent for negligence in prescribing the Accutane to her mother.  The
      appellant’s parents and siblings brought only derivative claims under the <i>Family
      Law Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3., and at trial, did not pursue a claim
      for breach of a duty of care owed directly to them by the doctor.</span></p>

      Paxton was 25 years old with three children when she began to see Dr.&nbsp;Ramji
      as her family doctor in 1997. She had had acne since her teens and had
      been prescribed and used a number of topical acne treatments. However,
      she continued to be concerned about her acne. In 2001, she heard about
      the acne drug, Accutane, and requested it from Dr. Ramji.  Because she
      was involved in becoming pregnant as a surrogate mother at that time, she
      could not be prescribed Accutane. She returned to Dr.&nbsp;Ramji in 2002,
      again requesting Accutane. Dr. Ramji assessed her acne as “inflammatory” with “ice-pick
      scarring on the face, neck, chest, upper back.”</span></p>

      2001, Dr. Ramji had taken a continuing education course for the prescription
      of Accutane. Because Accutane is a teratogenic drug that may cause birth
      defects if it is taken during pregnancy, the manufacturer developed a “Pregnancy
      Protection Mainpro-C Program” (“PPP”) that doctors are to implement before
      prescribing the drug to women of childbearing potential, in order to try
      to ensure they will not become pregnant while taking the medication. Dr.
      Ramji learned the details of the PPP at the course.  The content of the
      PPP as summarized by the trial judge at para. 134 of her reasons is as
      follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>Effective contraceptive measures must be used for at least one month
      before Accutane treatment during and/or at least one month following the
      discontinuation of treatment. It is recommended that two reliable forms
      of contraception be used simultaneously unless abstinence is the chosen
      method. Pregnancy occurring during treatment with Accutane and for one
      month after its discontinuation, carried the risk of fetal malformation.
      Females should be fully counseled on the serious risk to the fetus, should
      they become pregnant while undergoing treatment.</span></p>

      addition to the PPP, in March 2001, Health Canada forwarded a “Dear Doctor” letter
      from the manufacturer of Accutane advising doctors about the necessity

    “effective” contraception is defined as two reliable forms of contraception
    used simultaneously, unless abstinence is the chosen method. Two negative

      having failed after 4 ½ years. She continued with the Accutane, unaware

      trial judge approached the issues by first quantifying the damage claims,
      then assessing the standard of care, and finally determining whether the
      doctor owed a duty of care to Jaime Paxton. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge quantified all the heads of damages claimed by and on behalf
      of the respective appellants but denied the claim for punitive damages:
      see paras. 39-73. No appeal is brought from the quantification of damages.
      There is an appeal from the trial judge’s decision not to award punitive
      damages against the respondent.  Punitive damages were sought on the basis
      that the respondent had altered his clinical notes respecting his medical
      treatment of Dawn Paxton. The trial judge found that although the respondent’s
      conduct deserved censure, she believed that the College of Physicians and
      Surgeons would be taking some action, and that in such circumstances, the
      rare remedy of punitive damages would be inordinate.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge addressed two issues regarding the standard of care for prescribing
      Accutane. The first was whether, based on the nature and extent of Dawn
      Paxton’s acne condition, Accutane was an indicated treatment. On this issue,
      the trial judge considered her scarring from the acne and whether her subjective
      desire to use the drug was relevant to the doctor’s clinical judgment on
      whether to prescribe Accutane.  Having considered the expert and other
      evidence, the trial judge found that Dr. Ramji did not fall below the standard
      of care in deciding that Accutane was an indicated treatment for Dawn Paxton’s
      acne:  see paras. 101-13.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      second question was whether Dr. Ramji met the standard of care for prescribing
      Accutane to a woman of childbearing potential.  The trial judge described
      this standard as “based on requiring effective contraception when prescribing
      Accutane” (para. 133).  The trial judge assessed Dr. Ramji’s decision to
      rely on the 4 ½ year vasectomy by reference to the PPP and by comparison
      to what a reasonable and competent family physician would have done in
      like circumstances. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge found on the evidence that Dawn Paxton was confident about
      the efficacy of the vasectomy and that further counseling regarding birth
      control, or the need for an abortion if she became pregnant while on Accutane,
      would not have made a difference to her decision to take Accutane because
      of that confidence.  The trial judge also concluded that, because of the
      statistical reliability of a 4 ½ year vasectomy,<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;'>[3]</span></span></span></a> the introduction of
      a further form of birth control such as a condom would have reduced the
      likelihood of pregnancy by only a statistically infinitesimal amount. Finally,
      although Dr.&nbsp;Ramji did not follow exactly all of the steps in the
      PPP for prescribing Accutane, the trial judge concluded that the deficiencies
      in procedure “were not causative of the event that occurred”
    (para. 154).  She concluded that Dr. Ramji met the standard of care by relying
    on the 4 ½ year vasectomy as an effective form of birth control when prescribing
    Accutane: see paras. 139-54.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      final issue dealt with by the trial judge was whether Dr. Ramji owed a
      duty of care to Jaime Paxton. As noted above, Jaime Paxton was the only
      plaintiff asserting a direct claim for negligence against Dr. Ramji. The
      claims by her mother, father, and three siblings were confined to derivative
      claims under the <i>Family Law Act</i> for loss of care, guidance and companionship. </span></p>

      trial judge concluded that Dr. Ramji owed a duty of care to Jaime at the
      time he prescribed Accutane to her mother.  She described the duty as follows
      at para. 208:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>I find that Dr. Ramji owed a duty to the unconceived child of a woman

      concluding that this duty was owed by the doctor to the unconceived child,
      the trial judge considered the question whether Jaime’s claim should be
      characterized as one for “wrongful life”.  A claim for wrongful life has
      been defined as a claim brought by a child against a doctor or other health-care
      provider for allowing a child to be born with birth defects where, but
      for the wrongful act or omission of the doctor, the child would not have
      been born at all.  In the words of the trial judge, liability in such cases
      is framed “but for the negligence I would not have been born” (para. 156).  The
      trial judge found persuasive the decision of the Manitoba Court of Appeal
      in <i><span
style='color:black'>Lacroix (Litigation Guardian of) v. Dominique </span></i><span
style='color:black'>(2001), 202 D.L.R. (4th) 121</span> (leave to appeal to S.C.C.
      refused, [2001] S.C.C.A. No. 477), where that court held that Canadian
      law does not recognize an action for “wrongful life”. She concluded that
      existing case law supports this legal position: see paras. 157-66.  </span></p>

      trial judge considered whether or not Jaime’s claim was properly characterized
      as one for wrongful life.  She analyzed the question in the following manner.
      For Jaime’s claim to be characterized as one for wrongful life, it would
      be because, had Dr. Ramji adhered to the PPP in counseling Dawn Paxton
      to use two forms of birth control while on Accutane, Jaime may not have
      been born.  She found that a claim framed that way would be one for “wrongful
      life” and is not legally cognizable in Canada.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However,
      in the trial judge’s view, the claim should not be thought of as one for
      wrongful life (<i>i.e</i>., not one where the claim against Dr. Ramji was
      because Jaime should not have been born), but should instead be considered
      in the following way. If Dr. Ramji had abided by his duty not to prescribe
      Accutane to Dawn Paxton if she was a woman of childbearing potential, then
      Jaime could have been conceived, but with no exposure to Accutane. In that
      case, “but for” the prescription of a drug that is contraindicated for
      women of childbearing potential, Jaime would have been born without defects.
      Framed this way, the claim against Dr. Ramji is not a claim for wrongful
      life, but for causing Jaime’s disabilities. The trial judge concluded that
      because the claim is not one for “wrongful life”, Jaime was asserting a
      cause of action that the court would recognize: see paras. 185-210.</span></p>

      found that Dr. Ramji owed a duty of care to the unconceived child of a
      woman of childbearing potential, the trial judge returned to the standard
      of care in order to assess the doctor’s liability.  She approached the
      liability issue by asking whether Dr. Ramji was entitled to be satisfied
      that Dawn Paxton was not a woman of childbearing potential. The trial judge
      found that in Ontario, a doctor will meet the standard of care if the doctor
      is satisfied that a woman is not of childbearing potential because she
      is abstinent, the PPP is followed, she has had a hysterectomy, is menopausal,
      is surgically sterilized, or if her only partner has had a 4 ½ year vasectomy:
      see paras. 212-13. Because Paul Paxton, Dawn Paxton’s only sexual partner,
      had had a successful vasectomy some 4 ½ years earlier, the trial judge
      found that Dawn Paxton could not be characterized as a woman of childbearing
      potential and Accutane was therefore no longer contraindicated.  She concluded
      that Dr. Ramji thus met the standard of care and did not breach his duty
      of care to the unconceived potential child of his patient by prescribing
      the Accutane: see para. 215.  Accordingly, the trial judge dismissed the
      claim against him.</span></p>

      birth are brought by the parents (rather than by the child) who claim that
      their child would not have been conceived or born but for the doctor’s
      negligence.  In such claims, the parents seek damages associated with the
      birth and care of a child. Wrongful birth claims may arise from the birth
      of a healthy, but unplanned, child as in cases where a doctor is alleged
      to have negligently performed a sterilization procedure.  More commonly,
      wrongful birth claims involve the birth of a disabled child, as in cases
      where parents would have elected not to conceive a child had they received
      accurate genetic counseling about the likelihood that their child would
      be born with a disability, or to abort a child had they received advice
      regarding harm that can be caused <i>in utero</i> by such diseases as Rubella.

      an established category of relationship giving rise to a duty of care.  Where
      the relationship between the plaintiff and defendant is of a type that
      has already been judicially recognized as giving rise to a duty of care,
      or is analogous to a recognized category, “a court may usually infer that

      damages as a result, which were caused in fact and in law by the defendant’s

      owes a duty of care to the plaintiff. The test includes three components
      which are considered in a two-stage process: (1) reasonable foreseeability
      of harm; (2) proximity; (3) policy factors. The first stage determines
      whether there is a <i>prima facie</i> duty of care by analyzing reasonable

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>The basic proposition underlying
    “reasonable foreseeability” is that everyone “must take reasonable care to
    avoid acts or omissions which you can reasonably foresee would be likely
    to injure your neighbour” (<i>Donoghue v. Stevenson</i>, [1932] A.C. 562
    (H.L.), <i>per</i> Lord Atkin, at p. 580).  The question is whether the person
    harmed was “so closely and directly affected by my act that I ought reasonably
    to have them in contemplation as being so affected” (<i>Donoghue v. Stevenson</i>,
    at p. 580).</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>There must also be a relationship of sufficient proximity between
      the plaintiff and defendant. The purpose of this aspect of the analysis
      was explained by Allen Linden and Bruce Feldthusen in <i>Canadian Tort
      Law</i> (8<sup>th</sup> ed. 2006) as being to decide “whether, despite
      the reasonable foresight of harm, it is unjust or unfair to hold the defendant
      subject to a duty because of the absence of any relationship of proximity
      between the plaintiff and the defendant” (p. 304).</span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>If a <i>prima facie</i> duty of care is found to exist based on reasonable

      policy considerations also play a role in the initial determination of
      a <i>prima facie</i> duty of care. The importance of policy considerations
      at both stages was emphasized by Abella J. at paras. 31-33 of <i>Syl Apps</i>:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>As noted in <i>Cooper</i>, “the <i>Donoghue v. Stevenson</i> foreseeability-negligence

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>This means, the Court recognized, that policy is relevant at both
      the “proximity” stage and the “residual policy concerns” stage of the <i>Anns </i>test.
      The difference is that under proximity, the relevant questions of policy
      relate to factors arising from the particular relationship between the
      plaintiff and the defendant. In contrast, residual policy considerations
      are concerned not so much with “the relationship between the parties, but
      with the effect of recognizing a duty of care on other legal obligations,
      the legal system and society more generally” (<i>Cooper</i>, at para. 37).</span></p>

      to the fetus not to cause it harm if the abortion was unsuccessful. The
      court found that an alleged lack of proximity between the doctor and the
      fetus should not be a barrier to imposing a duty of care:  “We think the
      law would be wanting and badly flawed if it found itself in the position

      In that case, the doctor prescribed a teratogenic drug for epilepsy to
      the mother, but failed to advise her of the risk to a fetus if she were
      to become pregnant while taking the drug.  The mother became pregnant while
      taking the drug and the child suffered harm <i>in utero</i> as a result.  While
      both the child and the parents sued the doctor for damages caused by the

      discussing the second category of cases, the court referred at paras. 32-36
      to the 1982 decision in <i>McKay v. Essex Area Health Authority</i>, where
      the English Court of Appeal held that doctors cannot owe a duty to a fetus
      to terminate its existence, or to give its mother the opportunity to do
      so.  At para. 33 in <i>Lacroix</i>, the court referred to one of Stephenson
      L.J.’s reasons for this conclusion:  “To impose such a duty towards the
      child would, in my opinion, make a further inroad on the sanctity of human
      life which would be contrary to public policy” (p. 781).  The court also
      referred to the view of the English Court of Appeal that there is no such
      cause of action because it would be impossible to assess damages for such
      a wrong.  In the words of Griffith L.J. at p. 790 of <i>McKay</i>:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>To my mind,
    the most compelling reason to reject this cause of action is the intolerable
    and insoluble problem it would create in the assessment of damage… In a claim
    for wrongful life how does the court begin to make an assessment?  The plaintiff
    does not say, “But for your negligence I would have been born uninjured”;
    the plaintiff says, “But for your negligence I would never have been born.”  The
    court then has to compare the state of the plaintiff with non-existence,
    of which the court can know nothing; this I regard as an impossible task.</p>

      action against the doctor fell within the first category, because it was
      based on prescribing the epilepsy drug, or if it fell within the second
      category, because it was based on an allegation that the mother would not
      have become pregnant had she known the risks of the drug.  </span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>It is thus quite
    clear that, if the doctor had fulfilled his duty of care to the mother, the

    was caused by the medication does not result in liability against the doctor
    as he was under no duty of care to the child.  And the damages as in <i>McKay

      the injury to the fetus, the cause of action could well have been viewed

      Dawn Paxton’s acne, the duty on the doctor must have been to ensure that
      Jaime Paxton would never be conceived, making her claim one for wrongful
      life.  On the other hand, in the trial judge’s view, the appellant’s action
      was not a claim for wrongful life because the doctor’s duty was to refuse

      the court asked whether the doctor owed a duty of care to the unconceived

      court held that the doctor did not owe a duty of care to the twins before
      conception, but only to the mother to provide her with sufficient information
      to choose whether to take the drug. As the mother was entitled to take
      the risk of prematurity, the doctor could not owe a separate duty of care
      to the future children to protect them from that risk, as that duty would
      contradict the mother’s right to choose her treatment based on her own
      needs and her own best judgment. The court left open the question whether
      a doctor would owe a duty of care to a future child where the drug being

      example, in Canada, a mother does not owe a duty of care to her fetus:  <i>Dobson
      (Litigation Guardian of) v. Dobson</i>, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 753. A mother and
      her fetus are not separate legal entities. This was explained by the Supreme

      a similar approach to the foreseeability question in the duty of care analysis

      is the potential for a future child to be born who may be affected by a

        duties as a policy consideration and, indeed, “the deciding factor”
    weighing against a finding of a relationship of proximity (para. 41).  In
    that case, the issue was whether a treatment centre, which was treating a
    child apprehended by the Children’s Aid Society, owed a duty of care to the
    family of that child. The court held that, because of the statutory duties
    that the treatment centre owed to the child to act in her best interests,
    there would be an inevitable conflict of interest if the treatment centre
    also owed a duty of care to the family. Faced with that conflict, the treatment
    centre might well hesitate to pursue the child’s best interests for fear

      prospect of conflicting duties is similarly present here. If a doctor owes
      a duty of care to a future child of a female patient, the doctor could
      be put in an impossible conflict of interest between the best interests
      of the future child and the best interests of the patient in deciding whether
      to prescribe a teratogenic drug or to give the patient the opportunity
      to choose to take such a drug. That conflict was recognized by the Manitoba
      Court of Appeal in <i>Lacroix</i>, where a teratogenic epilepsy drug was
      necessary for the health of the mother. At paras. 38-39, the court identified
      the concern as follows:<i></i></span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>Can it be said that the doctor owed the future child a duty of care

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>The imposition of such a duty would immediately create an irreconcilable
      conflict between the duty owed by the doctor to the child and that owed
      to the mother. The medication was properly prescribed to treat the mother’s
      epilepsy. Without it, any fetus she might conceive would be at even greater
      risk from a seizure than from the medication. Surely the doctor cannot
      withhold the medication from the mother, and put her at risk, for the sake
      of avoiding risk to a yet unconceived fetus which might be at even greater
      risk if the mother’s epilepsy went uncontrolled.</span></p>

      one consideration that moved the court in terms of the potential conflict

      and if she were to have a seizure while pregnant, the fetus would be at
      greater risk from that seizure than from the drug. This extra risk factor
      will not be present in all cases where a teratogenic drug is being prescribed.
      For example, there is no evidence of extra risk posed to a fetus if its
      mother’s acne condition is not treated by Accutane. Nevertheless, the clear
      potential for conflicting duties remains between acting in the best interests
      of the mother and of a future child. </span></p>

      the PPP, in order to avoid the risk of a lawsuit brought by a child who
      is conceived despite compliance with the PPP or because the mother fails

      patient’s future child in addition to the existing duty to the female patient
      creates a conflict of duties that could prompt doctors to offer treatment

      agree. The doctor acts by providing advice and information to the mother
      including, where teratogenic drugs are being prescribed, the potential
      effects on a fetus. In the case of a drug that is not teratogenic, and
      where the only issue is informed consent, the patient takes the information

      other answer is that doctors, as professionals, have professional and ethical
      responsibilities and obligations to maintain prescribed standards of practice.  They
      are trusted to maintain these standards of practice and are also regulated
      by their professional bodies.  In the case of Accutane, there is ongoing
      assessment in the medical community of the effectiveness of the PPP and
      whether further measures are required to prevent harm to the fetus <i>in
      utero</i>. For example, in the United States, the Food and Drug Administration
      (FDA) recently tightened restrictions on the prescription of Accutane to
      women of childbearing potential, because of the number of women in that
      country who continued to become pregnant while taking the drug. In March
      2006, the FDA imposed the “iPLEDGE” program that requires all patients
      taking the drug to register, complete an informed consent form, obtain
      risk counseling and comply with the PPP.  The program further requires
      that all physicians register with iPLEDGE prior to prescribing the drug:  see
      Margot Andresen, “Accutane registry compulsory in US, but not

    Court of Appeal of California in <i>Curlender v. Bioscience Laboratories</i>,
    106 Cal. App. 3d 811 (1988), awarded general damages in an action for wrongful
    life, but this aspect of the decision was subsequently overruled by the Supreme
    Court of California in <i>Turpin v. Stortini</i>.  That court restricted
    liability in wrongful life claims to special damages.  The Supreme Court
    of Washington followed<i> Turpin </i>in <i>Harbeson v. Parke-Davis Inc</i>.,
    as did the Supreme Court of New Jersey in <i>Procanik v. Cillo</i>. The majority
    of the Supreme Court of Israel allowed a claim for wrongful life in 1986
    in <i>Zeitsov v. Katz</i>.  The court was divided on the issue of how damages
    should be measured.</p>

    courts have further distinguished between wrongful birth and wrongful conception
    or wrongful pregnancy:  see <i>Kealey v. Berezowski</i> (1996), 136 D.L.R.
    (4<sup>th</sup>) 708 (Ont. Ct. (Gen. Div.)). Nothing turns on this distinction
    for present purposes and so both types of claims are referred to here as
    wrongful birth.</p>

    Australia, see <i>Cattanach v. Melchior</i> (2003), 215 C.L.R. 1, where the
    majority of the High Court permitted recovery of upbringing costs in a wrongful
    birth claim arising from a failed sterilization that resulted in the birth
    of a healthy child. In the U.K., courts have allowed recovery of pregnancy-related
    costs and the extra costs attributable to a child’s disability in wrongful
    conception and wrongful birth claims, but have refused to award damages for
    the costs of raising a healthy, though unintended, child: see <i>McFarlane
    v. Tayside Health Board</i>, [2000] 2 A.C. 59 (H.L.); <i>Rees v. Darlington
    Memorial NHS Trust</i>, [2004] 1 A.C. 309 (H.L.); <i>Parkinson v. St. James
    and Seacroft University Hospital NHS Trust</i>, [2002] 2 Q.B. 266 (C.A.).  In
    the U.S., some states permit full recovery of upbringing costs for both healthy
    and disabled children, while the majority of states do not permit recovery
    of upbringing costs for healthy children. To give only a few examples of
    the extensive U.S. caselaw see: <i>University of Arizona Health Sciences
    Center v. Superior Court</i>, 667 P. 2d 1294 (Ariz. 1983), <i>Custodio v.
    Bauer</i>, 251 Cal. App. 2d 303 (1967); <i>Lovelace Medical Center v. Mendez</i>,
    805 P. 2d 603 (New Mex. 1991); <i>Rouse v. Wesley</i>, 494 N.W. 2d 7 (Mich.
    1992), <i>O’Toole v. Greenberg</i>, 477 N.E. 2d 445 (N.Y. 1985).  In Canada,
    courts have awarded upbringing costs to parents for disabled children while
    in their parent’s care: see for example <i>Krangle v. Brisco</i>, [2002]
    1 S.C.R. 205.  Some Canadian courts have refused to award upbringing costs
    for the costs of raising a healthy, but unintended child and have confined
    damages to pregnancy-related costs and lost income:  see <i>Kealey v. Berezowski</i>,
    where the parent’s cause of action was referred to as wrongful pregnancy
    rather than wrongful birth. Other courts have been prepared to award damages
    for upbringing costs of a healthy child, but require that the benefits of
    the child to the parent be considered in the damages assessment: <i>Suite
    v. Cooke</i>, [1993] R.J.Q. 514 (S.C.), aff’d [1995] R.J.Q. 2765 (C.A.).   </p>

    J. quoted at p. 942 from the Australian decision of the Supreme Court of
    Victoria in <i>Watt v. Rama</i>, [1972] V.R. 353 (
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Full Ct.) at 360-61 for the explanation of why the right to sue does not
    exist before birth. This quote reads in part as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>On the birth the
      relationship crystallized and out of it arose a duty on the defendant in
      relation to the child…[A]s the child could not in the very nature of things
      acquire rights correlative to a duty until it became by birth a living
      person, and as it was not until then that it could sustain injuries as
      a living person, it was, we think, at that stage that the duty arising
      out of the relationship was attached to the defendant, and it was at that
      stage that the defendant was, on the assumption that his act or omission
      in the driving of the car constituted a failure to take reasonable care,
      in breach of the duty to take reasonable care to avoid injury to the child….</span></p>
  <p><span style='font-size:10.0pt'>Consequently, when analyzing whether a doctor
      owes a <i>prima facie</i> duty of care and the nature of the doctor’s  “relationship” with
      the future child, it is at the point in time when there is only the potential
      for a child to be conceived or born that the doctor acts or omits to act
      in a way that results in the harm. However, in law, the duty of care is
      owed to the child who is born, as no duty of care can attach or crystallize
      until the child is born alive with the injuries.</span></p>

      trial judge’s conclusion on the lack of foreseeability of pregnancy in
      relation to whether Dr. Ramji met the standard of care, in the duty part
