  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s factum advanced many grounds of appeal relating to liability
    for negligent misrepresentation, the assessment of damages and costs.  In
    oral argument, counsel restricted his submissions to liability issues and
    to two aspects of the costs order.  We propose to address only the arguments
    made by counsel in his oral submissions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>    <b>Liability</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s submissions, stripped to their essentials, challenge factual
    findings made by the trial judge.  Those findings attract deference in this
    court.  With respect to the interpretation of the statements in the appellant’s
    promotional material, the trial judge found that those statements were misleading
    in that they suggested that transfer to another University Engineering Faculty
    after two years at Laurentian would be “routine and … devoid of any problem” (para.78).  The
    trial judge found that on information known to the University at the time
    these statements were made to the respondent, the statements were a misleading
    description of the transfer process (para. 45).  This finding supports the
    trial judge’s conclusions that misrepresentations were made by the University,
    and that they were in all of the circumstances negligently made.  We see
    no basis upon which we can interfere with those findings of fact.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    was ample evidence to support the conclusion that the representations as
    to the ability to transfer after second year were misleading in a material
    respect at the time the respondent accepted Laurentian’s offer of admission
    to its engineering program (Spring of 1994).  Counsel for the appellant properly
    points out that the trial judge made a factual error in respect of certain
    events in the fall of 1995.  In our view, that factual error was not material
    to his findings that the material contained misleading information, and that
    the misrepresentations were negligently made.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent testified that the misrepresentations in the promotional material
    were relevant to his decision to attend Laurentian University.  The trial
    judge was entitled to accept that evidence and made no reversible error in
    doing so.  We also see no basis upon which this Court could interfere with
    the trial judge’s assessment that, in all the circumstances, it was reasonable
    for the respondent, a high school senior, to rely on the representations
    made by Laurentian University in its promotional material.  As indicated
    above, the trial judge found that that material represented that transfer
    to third year at another engineering school after second year at Laurentian
    was a routine matter.  <i>Crerar v. Grande Prairie Regional College,</i> [2004]
    A.J. No. 1782 (Q.B.) was heavily relied on by the appellant to suggest that
    the respondent had an independent duty to enquire into matters relating to
    a possible transfer.  <i>Crerar</i> is distinguishable on its facts as explained
    by the trial judge (para. 80).  We agree with the distinctions pointed out
    by the trial judge. <i>Crerar</i> does not assist the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also submits that even if the University’s promotional material
    contained material misrepresentations that induced the respondent to attend
    Laurentian University, the respondent could have avoided his damages (an
    extra year to obtain his engineering degree) by making reasonable enquiries
    and structuring his course load at Laurentian in the first two years so as
    to permit transfer to another university, such as Windsor, needing only to
    take one additional course rather than a full extra year.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that the respondent took reasonable steps to facilitate
    his transfer to an engineering program at another university beginning in
    the fall of his second year at Laurentian.  The respondent anticipated transferring
    at the end of the second year.  The trial judge found that the respondent
    followed the course selection advice given to him by the Dean of Engineering
    at Laurentian.  It was open to the trial judge to find that the respondent
    acted reasonably with respect to his anticipated transfer to another university
    at the end of second year.  We would not interfere with that finding of fact.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    also agree with counsel for the respondent’s submission that, on this record,
    it would be speculation to suggest that the respondent actually could have
    structured his course load in the first two years at Laurentian to avoid
    the requirement of an extra year after transferring to another university.  In
    our view, the record does not permit that inference.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the appellant argues, for the reasons set out above, that there were no damages
    flowing from the negligent misrepresentations, he does not argue that the
    trial judge erred in his assessment of those damages assuming damages were
    caused.  We have rejected the argument that no damages flowed from the negligent
    misrepresentations.  We need not address the quantum of damages awarded given
    the position taken before us. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal from liability and the appeal with respect to the quantum of damages
    must be dismissed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>Costs</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    would grant leave to appeal costs.  The parties agree that paragraph 8 of
    the trial judge’s judgment should be deleted in its entirety.  The parties
    also agree that the reference to $30,000 in fees in paragraph 6 of the trial
    judge’s order should be deleted.  We agree with both concessions made by
    counsel for the respondent.  The judgment at trial in all other respects
    should stand.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    have heard submissions on costs.  Costs of the appeal should be on a partial
    indemnity basis.  Given the numbers that have been provided to us by counsel
    and the position of the parties, we would fix costs at $20,000, inclusive
    of disbursements and GST.</p>
