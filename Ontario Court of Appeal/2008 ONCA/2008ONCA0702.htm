    appellant, who is a paralegal, acted as an agent for an accused on a trial
    of a <i>Provincial Offences Act </i>offence in front of the respondent justice
    of the peace.  After acquitting the accused, the respondent notified the
    appellant that he would be initiating proceedings under s. 50(3) of the<i> Provincial
    Offences Act </i>R.S.O. 1990, c. P.33 as it read at the time.
     Following a hearing, the justice of the peace barred the appellant from
    appearing before him as an agent for anyone other than himself.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    50(3) read:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The court may bar any person from appearing as
    an agent who is not a barrister and solicitor entitled to practise in Ontario
    if the court finds that the person is not competent properly to represent
    or advise the person for whom he or she appears as agent or does not understand
    and comply with the duties and responsibilities of an agent.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Subsequently,
    Clarke J. dismissed the appellant’s application for <i>certiorari</i>.  He
    found that there are two separate bases upon which a court can make an order
    under s. 50(3).  A court has jurisdiction to make an order under the second
    branch of the test even though a particular trial is completed.  Further,
    the application judge rejected the appellant’s claim of a reasonable apprehension
    of bias.  Finally, the application judge concluded by saying that even if
    he was wrong in his interpretation of s. 50(3), no substantial wrong or miscarriage
    of justice occurred that would warrant the exercise of discretion to grant
    the order in the nature of <i>certiorari</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that the justice of the peace lacked jurisdiction to make
    an order under s. 50(3) because he did not make the order until after the
    particular trial on which the appellant appeared had been completed.  We
    do not need to decide whether the justice of the peace could have made the
    order under the first branch of s. 50(3) even after the trial had been completed
    because we agree with the application judge that the justice of the peace
    had jurisdiction to bar the appellant under the second branch of s. 50(3).  That
    section draws a distinction between whether the agent “is not competent properly
    to represent or advise” his or her client, and whether the agent does not
    appear to “understand and comply with the duties and responsibilities of
    an agent”.  The distinction is demonstrated by the legislature’s use of the
    disjunctive “or” to separate the two branches of the test.  The second branch
    is not tied to a particular trial and relates to the conduct of an agent
    generally.  The fact that challenged conduct could also be relevant to a
    bar under the first branch does not preclude a justice of the peace making
    a bar under the second branch.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    any event, in this case, much of the agent’s conduct referred to by the justice
    of the peace, both in his letter and in the proceedings considering the issue,
    addressed the agent’s conduct generally.  The challenged conduct was not
    restricted to the circumstances of the particular trial of the agent’s client.  For
    example, the agent’s alleged conduct included being unable to accept the
    court’s rulings, visibly displaying fits of temper, speaking over the justice
    of the peace, and forcefully pushing courtroom furniture.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    conduct was relevant to the agent’s ability to comply with the duties and
    responsibilities of an agent.  Further, while the justice of the peace noted
    the agent’s lack of preparation for the particular trial, he also noted the
    agent’s lack of preparation for his trials generally.  The appellant’s ability
    to prepare necessarily overlaps with his responsibility as an agent.  Since,
    in our view, the appellant’s conduct was clearly relevant to the second branch
    of the s. 50(3) test, which is not restricted to conduct in a particular
    case, we would not give effect to this ground of appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Regarding
    the appellant’s second ground of appeal, the appellant argues reasonable
    apprehension of bias based upon the justice of the peace’s comments when
    he notified the appellant of the s. 50(3) proceedings both in court and in
    the letter outlining the appellant’s conduct.  On this issue, the application
    judge reviewed the allegations and, when he considered those comments in
    the context of the record as whole, he was not persuaded that the justice
    of the peace predetermined the outcome of the case.  In coming to this conclusion,
    the application judge outlined the extensive opportunities the justice of
    the peace gave to the appellant to retain counsel and to present his case.  We
    agree with the application judge that the impugned language of the justice
    of the peace did not raise a reasonable apprehension of bias.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the appeal is dismissed.</p>
