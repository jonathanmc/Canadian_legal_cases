  <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>These
    are the reasons for decision in respect of the costs in <i>David Polowin
    Real Estate Ltd. v. The Dominion of Canada General Insurance Co.</i> (2005),
    76 O.R. (3d) 161 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) and seven related appeals.<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    June 2001, this court released its judgment in <i>McNaughton Automotive Ltd.
    v. Co-operators General Insurance Co.</i> (2001), 54 O.R. (3d) 704 (
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  The Supreme Court of Canada subsequently refused leave to appeal, 2001
    S.C.C.A. No. 451.  In <i>McNaughton</i>, this court decided that the practice
    of automobile insurers to charge a deductible on total loss claims – where
    the insurer took the title to the salvage –
    constituted a breach of statutory condition 6(7) in O. Reg. 777/93 under
    the <i>Insurance Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.I.8.  The <i>McNaughton</i> judgment
    was the catalyst for the commencement of class actions in thirty-five different
    cases, which included as defendants the appellants in this proceeding (“the
    insurers”). </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Justice
    Roland J. Haines of the Superior Court of Justice (“the motions judge”) was
    designated as the case management judge for all thirty-five actions.  The
    insurers brought several preliminary motions under Rules 20 and 21 of the <i>Rules
    of Civil Procedure</i>.  A number of these motions revisited the issue of
    the proper interpretation of statutory condition 6(7) based on an expansive
    evidentiary record that had not previously been before the court and on the
    basis that <i>McNaughton</i> was wrongly decided by this court.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    his reasons dated July 14, 2003, the motions judge dismissed the statutory
    interpretation motions on the basis that he was bound to follow this court’s
    decision in <i>McNaughton</i>.  He said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The question is whether this court can decline to
    follow that conclusion on the basis of the expanded evidentiary record and
    the absence of any reference to s. 261 of the <i>Insurance Act</i> in the
    decision of the Court of Appeal.  It may be open to the Court of Appeal to
    reconsider its decision in <i>McNaughton</i> on these grounds but in my opinion,
    I am bound by that decision[.]</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>Accordingly, in reasons dated January
    19, 2005 and March 9, 2005, the motions judge granted partial indemnity costs
    to the respondents (“plaintiffs”), in an amount to be fixed later.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Eventually,
    a five judge panel of this court considered the appeal of The Dominion of
    Canada General Insurance
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    Co. and the appeals of the other seven insurers from the decisions of the
    motions judge on the statutory interpretation issue.  All the appeals on
    this issue were heard together.  On June 15, 2005, the court reversed its
    earlier decision in <i>McNaughton</i> and held that statutory condition 6(7)
    did not prohibit the application of the policy deductible in total loss cases.  Each
    of the eight representative plaintiffs sought leave to appeal to the Supreme
    Court of Canada.  On January 26, 2006, the Supreme Court dismissed all the
    leave to appeal applications.  As a result, all the class actions have since
    terminated.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    its reasons granting the insurers’ appeals, this court invited the parties
    to make written submissions on the costs of the motions and the appeals.  The
    court reserved its decision on costs until it disposed of several motions
    for leave to appeal brought by the representative plaintiffs from certain
    costs orders of the motions judge made in respect of other motions brought
    by the insurers under Rules 20 and 21.  On August 29, 2008, this court dismissed
    those motions for leave to appeal and, accordingly, we are now in a position
    to deliver these decisions on costs.</p>
  <h2>COSTS SUBMISSIONS</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    written submissions received from the parties are comprehensive, exceeding
    200 pages in total.  It is neither necessary nor practical to summarize those
    submissions in detail.  What follows is a general summary of the positions
    taken by the parties.  </p>
  <h2>(i)        The plaintiffs </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although
    unsuccessful, the plaintiffs ask this court to exercise its discretion under
    rule 57.01(2) of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><b><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></b></span></span></a></i> and award the plaintiffs their costs on
    a substantial indemnity scale or, in the alternative, on a partial indemnity
    scale.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    plaintiffs submit that although their lawyers took their cases on a contingency
    fee basis, they did so in reliance upon the court’s decision in <i>McNaughton</i>.  It
    was not reasonably foreseeable that the court would reverse its own decision
    as it did in <i>Polowin</i>.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>They
    invoke the exception contained in rule 57.01(2) in part on the basis that
    the law firms representing the plaintiffs are small firms which now must
    write-off all the time they have spent on these cases resulting in “disastrous” financial
    consequences.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    plaintiffs further submit that these cases are consumer protection cases
    involving a matter of public interest.  It is important to encourage plaintiffs’
    lawyers to take on these sorts of cases so, that consumers receive access
    to justice.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    plaintiffs also submit that the insurance industry failed to draft an insurance
    policy with examples illustrating what happens to the salvage in a total
    loss case.  If they had done so these actions would not have been necessary.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    the plaintiffs argue that the insurers received a windfall when, in 2003,
    the Ontario legislature amended the statutory conditions to permit an insurer
    to charge the deductible in a total loss case part way through a policy year – effective
    immediately rather than on the renewal of the policy – allegedly because
    the premium charges took account of this court’s decision in <i>McNaughton</i>.  </p>
  <h2>            (ii)      The insurers</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dominion
    of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    , Belair, ING Halifax, Wawanesa and Economical seek partial indemnity costs
    on the statutory interpretation motions and the appeals.  They also seek
    costs of the actions against each of them on a partial indemnity scale in
    an amount to be determined by the motions judge.  Finally, as part of its
    claim for costs of the appeal, Dominion of Canada seeks partial indemnity
    costs for a fresh evidence motion.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    respect of Liberty Mutual and Federation, the statutory interpretation issue
    was raised by way of cross-appeal.  Thus, they seek only the costs of their
    successful cross-appeals on a partial indemnity scale.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Zurich seeks only the costs of its appeal on a partial indemnity scale since
    it did not actively participate in the statutory interpretation motion before
    the motions judge.  Instead, it relied on the position advanced by the other
    insurers.  Since the motions judge made an order for partial indemnity costs
    against
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Zurich, it simply asks that the order be set aside.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    insurers, in general, submit that costs should follow the event because there
    are no special circumstances justifying a deviation from the usual rule.  They
    further submit that none of the factors set out in s. 31(1) of the <i>Class
    Proceedings Act, 1992</i>, S.O. 1992 c. 6 (the “<i>CPA</i>”) apply to these
    cases.  For instance, none of the cases was a test case, raised a novel point
    of law or involved a matter of public interest.  While the <i>McNaughton</i> case
    may have been a test case – these cases are not test cases.  These cases
    involve no more than a routine commercial dispute between the insurers and
    the policy holders.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    insurers also rely upon the following statement of Winkler J. in <i>Smith
    v. Canadian Tire Acceptance Ltd.</i> (1995), 22 O.R. (3d) 433 at 449 (O.C.G.D.);
    aff’d (1995), 26 O.R. (3d) 94 (C.A.): </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The <i>Class Proceedings Act, 1992</i> was never
    intended to insulate representative plaintiffs, or class members, from the
    possible costs consequences of unsuccessful litigation.  The goal of the
    Act is not to encourage the promotion of litigation.  Rather, it is designed
    to provide a procedure whereby courts will be more readily accessible to
    groups of plaintiffs.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    insurers raise a number of other factors in support of their request for
    costs, including:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    plaintiffs’ actions could not be said to raise an issue of public interest
    because, had they succeeded, insurance rates would have increased substantially,
    which would have had a detrimental effect on a greater number of members
    of the public.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    the amount claimed by any class member on an individual basis was low, the
    total claims against the insurers were huge.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motions judge awarded the successful plaintiffs their costs of the statutory

    ought similarly to award costs to the successful insurers.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Law Foundation administers the Class Proceedings Fund.  The Fund provided
    financial support to the plaintiffs in these appeals and in the cases before
    the motions judge.  Thus, the Law Foundation is a party to these appeals
    in relation to the issue of costs pursuant to rule 12.04(2) and (3) of the <i>Rules
    of Civil Procedure</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Law Foundation submits that there should be no order as to the costs of the
    appeals.  In respect of the statutory interpretation motions, however, the
    Law Foundation seeks an order upholding the motions judge’s awards of costs
    to the plaintiffs on a partial indemnity scale.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    support of its position that there ought to be no costs of the appeals, the
    Law Foundation relies upon s. 31(1) of the <i>CPA</i>.  The Law Foundation
    asserts that the issues before the motions judge and this court constituted
    a test case, raised a novel point of law and involved a matter of public
    interest.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Law Foundation relies upon <i>Vennell v. Barnardo’s</i> (2005), 73 O.R. (3d)
    13 (S.C.J.) at para. 25 where Cullity J. said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A test case, as I understand it, ordinarily refers
    to a pro-ceeding that will determine the issues that will arise in other
    cases that are pending or, at least, contemplated.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    addition to the consideration of the factors under s. 31(1) of the <i>CPA</i>,
    the Law Foundation asserts that the complexity of the <i>Insurance Act</i> and
    its regulations; the difficulty in interpreting statutory condition 6(7);
    and, the fact that this court and the parties were faced with a previous
    decision of this court on exactly the same point, militate in favour of an
    award of no costs.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    respect of the statutory interpretation motions, the Law Foundation submits
    that this court concluded that the motions judge’s ruling, based upon <i>stare
    decisis</i>, was appropriate.  That said, it follows that the costs order
    that followed the ruling should stand.  In the alternative, the Law Foundation
    asserts that the appropriate order is “an award of no costs”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    the Law Foundation asserts that there should be no award of costs in respect
    of each of the actions since all the s. 31(1) <i>CPA</i> factors are engaged
    by these cases.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    are other issues raised by the Law Foundation relating to both scale and
    quantum of costs.  In the view I take of this matter, it is not necessary
    to deal with either scale or quantum.</p>
  <h2>ANALYSIS</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    see no basis for exercising the court’s discretion to award costs to the
    unsuccessful plaintiffs.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    plaintiffs assert that, absent an award of costs in their favour, the law
    firms representing them will suffer disastrous financial consequences because
    they will have to write-off all the time that they have spent on these cases.  In
    my view, this submission is contrary to the aforementioned statement of Winkler
    J. in <i>Smith v. Canadian Tire Acceptance Ltd., supra</i> that “the <i>Class
    Proceedings Act, 1992</i> was never intended to insulate representative plaintiffs
    or class members, from the possible costs consequences of unsuccessful litigation.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    cases such as these, one needs to consider the issue of costs in the context
    of the nature of contingency fees.  Contingency fees in class actions are
    premised on the theory that when the plaintiffs are successful, their counsel
    will be remunerated at a level that exceeds the level of remuneration in
    the usual non-contingency case.  This approach offsets the risk to the plaintiffs’ counsel
    when the plaintiffs are unsuccessful.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    agree with counsel for Wawanesa and ING Halifx that there is an entrepreneurial
    element to this litigation.  This is evident in the plaintiffs’ attempt to
    broaden the class definition to include all policy holders back to 1975 and
    policy holders in a large geographical area beyond the borders of
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario.  It is obvious that if the plaintiffs had succeeded in these efforts,
    and ultimately in the cases at trial, the rewards for the lawyers would have
    been more than handsome.  While there is nothing inherently wrong with lawyers
    adopting an approach that will provide generous costs awards in terms of
    premiums and multipliers, such an approach has its economic risks that must
    be apparent to the lawyers who take such risks.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Courts
    will generally exercise their discretion to award costs against a successful
    party only in exceptional cases.  Exceptional cases may include misconduct
    on the part of the successful party.  See <i>Wismer v. Javelin International
    Ltd.</i> (1992), 38 O.R. (2d) 26 (H.C.J.) at 34.  Courts have also exercised
    this discretion in significant public interest cases such as <i>Charter</i> cases.  See <i>Schacter
    v.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    </i>, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 679 at 726 and <i>Horsefield v.

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the instant case and the related appeals, although misconduct was alleged
    in some of the statements of claim against the insurers, none was proven.  The
    submission by the plaintiffs that the insurers failed to draft an insurance
    policy in plain language which included realistic examples does not constitute
    misconduct.  In any event, there is no evidence that these insurers were
    responsible for the language of the policy which was required to be used
    by all insurers in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    plaintiffs also allege that the insurers received a windfall when in 2003
    the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario government amended the statutory conditions part way through the
    policy year and effective immediately (not on renewal of the policy).  There
    is no evidence before us to support this allegation.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    short, there is simply no evidence of any conduct on the part of the insurers
    that would warrant an order for costs against them.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Also
    I am not persuaded that these cases fall into a category of public interest
    litigation that would justify a costs order under rule 57.01(2).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    agree with the submission of the plaintiffs that it was not reasonably foreseeable
    that <i>McNaughton</i> would be overruled, at least at the time when these
    actions were commenced.  However, in this case, this does not constitute
    the kind of exceptional circumstance that would justify the invocation of
    this court’s discretion to make an award of costs in favour of the unsuccessful
    plaintiffs.  Even though it was not reasonably foreseeable that <i>McNaughton</i> would
    be overruled it nonetheless was a risk the plaintiffs had to bear when they
    started their litigation.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    next question is whether there should be a costs award in favour of the insurers
    pursuant to the usual rule on costs.  While counsel for the insurers make
    a number of compelling points in support of such an award, I am not persuaded
    that the normal rule should be applied in the unusual circumstances of this
    case.  In my view, the appropriate disposition is a no costs award.  I come
    to this conclusion for three reasons.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    these cases collectively constitute a test case.  Adopting the definition
    of Cullity J. in <i>Vennell</i> that a test case refers to a proceeding that
    will determine the issues that will arise in other cases, it is difficult
    to avoid the conclusion that these cases constitute test cases.  The decision
    of this court has had the effect of disposing of all of the thirty-five class
    actions.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    given the particular circumstances of these cases, the fair and reasonable
    result is a no costs order.  While not unique, it is a rare circumstance
    that this court reverses one of its own decisions.  This is particularly
    so when the reversal takes place within such a short time frame.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third,
    the plaintiffs, armed with this court’s decision in <i>McNaughton</i>, proceeded
    with these actions in the reasonable expectation that they were on firm ground
    in doing so.  While one can be critical of the plaintiffs’ “pushing the envelope” in
    respect of the class definition and in respect of the allegations concerning
    fraudulent conduct, in most instances they have already had costs orders
    made against them in those matters and leave to appeal from those orders
    has been dismissed.  See <i>McNaughton Automotive Ltd. v. Co-operators General
    Insurance Company</i> released by this court on August 29, 2008.  The real
    issue here is whether the plaintiffs should bear the costs of the insurers
    in respect of the statutory interpretation motions and the appeals.  In my
    view, in the special circumstances of this case, it would not be fair or
    reasonable to saddle the plaintiffs with such further costs.</p>
