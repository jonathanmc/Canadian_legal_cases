  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>By the Court:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The appellants were the listing agent for
    the vendor and the agent for the purchaser in connection with the sale of a
    property to be used as a dental office. The sale closed on June 28, 1995.
    Following the closing, the purchaser learned that the property did not have the
    eight parking spaces required by the applicable zoning by-law to permit its use
    as a dental office. This was because four of the parking spaces encroached on
    adjoining lands that the vendor had previously conveyed to his wife and because
    the other four parking spaces were the subject of a revocable parking
    arrangement with the city.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      Initially, the purchaser sued his lawyer
    for negligence and that action settled. The purchaser then commenced this
    action against the appellants and the vendor of the property, claiming damages
    for negligence and misrepresentation. At trial, the purchaser sought a
    determination of the total amount of damages he had suffered, as well as a
    determination of the degree of fault to be apportioned to each of the appellants,
    the vendor and the purchaser’s lawyer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    trial judge found the appellants and the vendor liable in negligence and apportioned
    liability as follows: the purchaser’s lawyer (50 %), the listing agent and his
    employer (20%), the purchaser’s agent and his employer (20%), and the vendor
    (10%). In addition, the trial judge assessed damages at $164,563, being
    $110,000 on account of the difference between the sale price of the price of
    the property ($270,000) and its reduced value without adequate parking
    ($160,000), plus $54,563 on account of the cost of borrowing $110,000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants raise three grounds of appeal. First, while
    they do not challenge the trial judge’s finding that they were negligent, the
    appellants argue that the trial judge erred in allocating 20% of the fault or
    negligence to each of them. They submit that because the vendor received the
    largest portion of the benefits resulting from the negligence, the trial judge
    should have allocated a proportionately larger amount of the fault or
    negligence to the vendor and correspondingly lesser amounts to them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not accept this argument. The purchaser brought
    an action against all the defendants based on negligence and misrepresentations.
    The trial judge found that each of the defendants was negligent. Pursuant to s.
    1 of the <i>Negligence Act</i>,  R.S.O. 1990, c. N.1, the trial judge then
    determined the degree in which each of the defendants was at fault or
    negligent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 1 of the <i>Negligence
    A </i>reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Where damages have been caused or contributed to by
    the fault or neglect of two or more persons, the court shall determine the
    degree in which each of such persons is at fault or negligent, and where two or
    more persons are found at fault or negligent, they are jointly and severally
    liable to the person suffering loss or damage for such fault or negligence, but
    as between themselves, in the absence of any contract express or implied, each
    is liable to make contribution and indemnify each other in the degree in which
    they are respectively found to be at fault or negligent. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Importantly, s. 1 speaks to determining liability on
    the basis of the degree in which each defendant is found to be at fault or
    negligent. The section does not contemplate that liability to the plaintiff be
    based on other considerations such as the amount of benefit received by one
    defendant as compared to that received by others. In making this observation,
    we should not be taken to say that the receipt of a benefit obtained by
    negligence could never be a factor in determining the degree of fault or
    negligence. We are saying only that, at most, the receipt of a benefit could be
    a factor in determining the degree of fault or negligence, it is not a
    freestanding consideration.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the trial judge was alive to the fact
    that the vendor received a higher price for the property than he would have
    received had the purchaser been aware of the shortage of parking spaces. However,
    the trial judge noted that there was no evidence that the vendor would have
    sold the property for a lesser amount. The vendor may well have chosen to keep
    the property rather than sell it for a reduced price. Had he kept the property,
    it would have been open to him to adjust the eastern boundary to address the
    parking problem. Against that background it is important to bear in mind that
    the appellants’ negligence, as found by the trial judge, played a substantial
    role in the events that led to the difficulties that underlie this law suit. In
    these circumstances, we see no basis to interfere with the way the trial judge
    allocated fault or negligence among the defendants. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, we would not give effect to this ground of
    appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the appellants asserted a cross-claim against
    the vendor for unjust enrichment on the premise that the vendor received a
    purchase price of $270,000 for a property that the trial judge concluded was
    only worth $160,000. However, in our view, it is not open to the appellants to
    raise a claim that the vendor was unjustly enriched. To succeed in such a
    claim, the appellants would be required to establish that they suffered a
    deprivation. However, on the facts of this case, if any party suffered a
    deprivation, it was the purchaser who acquired a property of significantly less
    value than that for which he had bargained. The fact that the appellants may be
    obliged to compensate the purchaser for a portion of his losses because of
    their negligence cannot support a claim for unjust enrichment. Accordingly, we
    would not give effect to this ground of appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, we are not satisfied that the trial judge erred
    in finding that the limitation period with respect to the purchaser’s claim
    against the appellants did not begin to run until the purchaser first learned
    about the parking problem after the closing date. The appellants submit that
    the limitation period commenced to run prior to the closing based on a theory
    that the purchaser’s solicitor ought to have discovered the parking problem
    prior to closing and that his imputed knowledge should be attributed to the
    purchaser. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, a conclusion that the limitation period
    commenced to run on an earlier date would have required not only a finding that
    the purchaser’s lawyer ought to have discovered the parking problem prior to
    closing but also a finding that the purchaser’s lawyer ought to have turned his
    mind to and discovered the appellants’ negligence prior to closing. The trial
    judge did not make either of these findings. Even if the appellants are correct
    that a solicitor’s knowledge may be attributed to a client in some instances, we
    are not persuaded that, in the circumstances of this case, the trial judge
    erred in approaching the discoverability issue in the way that he did. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not accept the appellants’ argument that s.
    139(2) of the <i>Courts of Justice</i> <i>Act</i> should disentitle the purchaser to
    his costs. We see no basis to interfere with the trial judge’s implicit
    conclusion that it was reasonable in the circumstances for the purchaser to sue
    his lawyer first. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal is dismissed with costs to the respondent
    purchaser fixed in the amount of $11,000 inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T. </p>
