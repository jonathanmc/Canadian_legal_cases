  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>From September 2003 to December 2003, the
    appellant, who was sixteen years old, babysat the complainant and her younger
    sister a number of times, including on December 21, 2003.  When the complainant’s parents returned home
    that evening, the complainant’s sister told them that her “pee-pee” was
    sore.  When she was asked why it was
    sore, she told her parents that the appellant had touched it.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  The complainant then stated that her
    “pee-pee” was also sore, and that the appellant had touched her as well.  The complainant also stated that the
    appellant had touched her on one previous occasion, while babysitting her after
    school. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A week later, the complainant gave a videotaped
    statement to the police, in which she further described the manner in which the
    appellant touched her vagina.  She added
    that, on the earlier of the two described occasions, the appellant assaulted
    her with a Tinkertoy, saying that “he used it up my pee-pee”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A nurse examined the complainant on January 15, 2004,
    and found no evidence of unusual genital injury or healed injury.  The hymen remained intact, and while there
    was some redness and a small tear below the hymen, this was not uncommon for
    young girls, particularly given the complainant’s recent recovery from chicken
    pox. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:

  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:

  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant does not challenge the convictions
    on the basis that the trial judge reached unreasonable verdicts.  Rather, he challenges the convictions on the
    following three bases.  First, he argues
    that the trial judge failed to properly consider inconsistencies and
    improbabilities in the complainant’s evidence; second, that the trial judge
    applied different standards to the defence evidence than to the Crown evidence
    and placed undue emphasis on the appellant’s failure to testify; and third,
    that the trial judge failed to consider properly the expert evidence of Dr.
    Valliant. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>1.         Failure to properly scrutinize complainant’s evidence</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant argues that when assessing the
    complainant’s evidence the trial judge fell into error in disregarding three
    matters: the inconsistency between the complainant’s description of the Tinkertoy
    incident and the medical evidence, the potential tainting of the complainant’s
    version of events before the video statement, and the potential involvement of
    the complainant’s brother in any sexual improprieties.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We do not agree with the appellant that the
    trial judge erred in failing to find that the complainant’s version of the Tinkertoy
    event was inconsistent with the medical evidence.  In our view, the trial judge properly
    recognized that the medical evidence provided no physical corroboration of the
    alleged sexual offences.  However, it was
    open to the trial judge to interpret the complainant’s evidence in a way that
    was consistent with the medical evidence.  The complainant did not refer to significant pain as a result of the use
    of the Tinkertoy.  Her description of the
    incident was equally consistent with using the Tinkertoy in a way that would
    not result in injury. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We do not agree with the appellant that the
    trial judge failed to consider the possible tainting of the complainant’s
    version of the events before she gave her videotaped statement.  At the outset of his reasons, the trial judge
    stated “special attention must be paid to the defence theory that [the
    complainant’s] evidence is without merit because it was based on information
    rehearsed to her by her mother and acquired in the process of
    investigation.”  After reviewing the
    evidence of potential tainting, the trial judge concluded that, because of the
    specific and detailed nature of the complainant’s evidence, tainting had not
    occurred.  This finding was open to the
    trial judge on the evidence and we see no basis to interfere with it.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Next it is argued that the trial judge failed to
    consider the possibility that the complainant’s brother could have committed
    the sexual acts that formed the subject of the charges.  The trial judge considered the evidence
    relating to the brother’s opportunity to have committed these offences.  With respect to the offence that took place
    on December 21, the evidence disclosed that the brother was bowling with the
    complainant’s parents and would have had no opportunity to commit that
    assault.  With respect to the earlier
    incident, the trial judge reviewed the evidence and found that the brother had
    not lived or visited at the complainant’s home in the period from mid-August to
    mid-December, 2003.  In these
    circumstances, the trial judge was entitled to reject the suggestion that the
    brother would have had the opportunity to commit the earlier offence.  We see no basis to interfere with the trial
    judge’s conclusion.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly, we would not give effect to this
    ground of appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>2.         Shifting the burden</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant argues that the trial judge erred
    by attaching weight to the appellant’s decision not to testify.  Early in his reasons, the trial judge
    mentioned on two occasions the appellant’s failure to testify.  However, in each instance the trial judge
    made it clear that he was not drawing a negative or adverse inference against
    the appellant.  Although it may have been
    preferable if the trial judge had not referred to the appellant’s failure to
    testify, we are not satisfied on reading his reasons as a whole that he shifted
    the burden or used this consideration in any improper way.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Towards the end of his reasons, in dealing with
    the weight to be attached to the evidence of an expert called by the appellant
    with respect to his psychological profile, the trial judge again referred to
    the fact that the appellant had not testified.  The lack of evidence from the appellant was a relevant consideration in
    the trial judge’s assessment of this issue.  It is important to note that at that point the
    trial judge was not referring to the failure to testify in the context of his
    analysis of the strength of the Crown’s case.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We would not give effect to this ground of
    appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>3.         The appellant’s expert evidence</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant argues that the trial judge erred
    in failing to properly consider the evidence of Dr. Valliant, an expert called
    by the defence to testify that the appellant did not exhibit any of the general
    characteristics of sexually deviant behaviour and that it was therefore
    unlikely that he committed these offences.  The trial judge considered this evidence and concluded that it was not
    helpful.  As we have said, in reaching
    this conclusion, it was open to the trial judge to consider the absence of
    evidence at trial to support the expert’s opinion, including the absence of evidence
    from the appellant.  We see no error in
    the trial judge’s conclusion and we would not give effect to this ground of
    appeal.  In saying this, we should not be
    taken as agreeing that the evidence was admissible in the first place.  </p>
