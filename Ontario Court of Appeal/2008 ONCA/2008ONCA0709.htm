    issue on this appeal is whether the appellant David Young’s wrongful dismissal
    action against the respondents (which are all owned by Tyco International
    Ltd.) should be tried in the state of
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Indiana instead of in

    was employed by one or more of the Tyco entities for nearly ten years.  For
    the first eight years, he worked for Tyco’s
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario operation, initially as its plant manager and then as its general
    manager.  By 2004, because of downsizing, Tyco no longer needed a general
    manager in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario.  In October 2004, Young and his
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    Ontario boss agreed that Young would continue to work for Tyco and would
    perform temporary assignments in North America until a permanent position
    became available at another Tyco plant in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place

      Canada</st1:country-region>
    .</p>

    the next 21 months, Young worked at three of Tyco’s U.S. plants, first in
    Wisconsin, then in Georgia, and finally in Indiana.  He had been plant manager
    of the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Indiana operation for only two and a half months when Tyco fired him for
    allegedly sexually harassing three female employees.  Young denied the allegations
    and claimed that he was let go because he had a disability arising from brain
    seizures he had suffered.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Young
    started this action in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario against the six Tyco defendants, two of whom have offices in this
    province.  Tyco moved for a stay of the action.  It contended that
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario was not the convenient forum and that Young’s action should be tried
    in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Indiana.  The motion judge granted the stay.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    its heart, the debate before the motion judge turned on what agreement governed
    Young’s employment with Tyco in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Indiana.  Young maintains that his October 2004 agreement governed his employment
    in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Indiana.  Tyco maintains that the October 2004 agreement was superseded by
    an offer of permanent employment in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Indiana, which Young accepted.  The motion judge resolved that debate by
    agreeing with Tyco’s position.  He held that “there is little beyond the
    belief of David Young to sustain this idea” that the October 2004 agreement
    governed.  The motion judge added that, by suing in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario, Young was simply shopping for a jurisdiction where he could succeed
    in his action.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Young’s
    principal submission on appeal is that the motion judge erred by deciding
    the merits of Young’s underlying claim and by too easily dismissing the evidence
    supporting his claim.  I agree with that submission.  In my respectful view,
    the motion judge erred in principle by accepting Tyco’s position on the governing
    agreement for the purpose of deciding where Young’s claim should be tried.  The
    resulting stay that he ordered was unreasonable.  I would set aside the motions
    judge’s decision and dismiss Tyco’s stay motion.</p>

      first hired Young in October 1996, as plant manager for Columbia-MBF, its
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario operation.  He was paid over $200,000
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      U.S.</st1:country-region>
    in salary and bonus and was given a generous benefits package.  He was hired
    for an indefinite term and therefore, absent cause, was entitled to reasonable
    notice of termination under
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario law.  In 2000, Tyco promoted Young to the position of general manager
    of Columbia-MBF.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However,
      in late 2004, Tyco closed down its manufacturing operation in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place

    Ontario.  It therefore no longer needed a general manager.  Young wanted
    to continue to work for Tyco, but only in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>

    Ontario residents.  However, Tyco had no senior position available in

      October 2004, Young met with his boss, Vijay Patel, who also wanted Young

      <st1:place w:st="on">
      United States</st1:country-region>
    , Young did not want to move there.  Eventually, they agreed that Young’s
    employment would continue on essentially the same terms as he had at Columbia-MBF,
    but that he would perform temporary assignments until another permanent position
    arose in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">

    not receive any termination pay.</span></p>

    Green Bay,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Wisconsin, to perform a safety audit and deal with other management issues
    there.  Young did as he was asked.  This was one of the temporary assignments

    of Young’s employment with Tyco, the parties largely agree on what occurred.</span></p>

      was asked to sign a written offer of employment.  He says that he was reluctant
      to do so but did sign it after Norvilas assured him that it would not affect
      his October 2004 agreement.  Young contends that he told both Patel and
      Norvilas that he would not move permanently to the
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>
    because both he and his common-law spouse (who remained in

      work at Georgia Pipe, Young had to apply for an L-1A visa.  The L-1A visa
      is a temporary visa that permits a company with operations in both the

    and a foreign state (in this case,
    <st1:country-region

    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      U.S.</st1:country-region>
    immigration authorities that Young was not being offered a permanent position.  Young’s
    application for an L-1A visa was approved for three years.  He began working
    at Georgia Pipe in mid-March 2005.  Nonetheless, he was paid by Columbia-MBF
    until January 2006.</span></p>

      factors listed above are not exhaustive, although in practice they are
      the ones typically considered.  All of the factors may not be relevant
      in a given case.  Moreover, the exercise is not mathematical.  Motion judges
      assign each factor the weight they consider appropriate to the case.  Their
      overall balancing of these factors reflects the discretionary nature of
      the decision.  On appeal, the usual principle of deference to discretionary
      decision applies: an appeal court should intervene only if the motion judge

      principles should guide the motion judge’s exercise of discretion.  The
      first principle is that, on a <i>forum non conveniens </i>motion, the standard
      to displace the plaintiff’s chosen jurisdiction is high.  Before
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario motion judges decline jurisdiction, “the existence of a more appropriate
    forum must be clearly established to displace the forum selected by the plaintiff”:
    see <i>Amchem Products Inc. v.

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      second principle is that the balancing of the relevant factors should aim
      to achieve the twin goals of efficiency and justice.  Ritchie J. made this
      point thirty years ago in <i>Antares Shipping Corp. v. The Ship “
    Capricorn”</i>, [1977] 2 S.C.R 422 at 448:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>In my view the overriding consideration
      which must guide the Court in exercising its discretion by refusing to
      grant such an application as this must, however, be the existence of some
      other forum more convenient and appropriate for the pursuit of the action
      and for securing the ends of justice.</span></p>

      recently, in <i>Hunt v. T&amp;N plc</i>, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 289 at para. 59,
      La Forest J. reiterated this principle when he said that the court’s exercise
      of its discretion to decline jurisdiction must be guided by the mandates
      of “order and fairness, not a mechanical counting of contacts or connections.”  In
      other words, the motion judge’s decision whether to decline jurisdiction
      turns not only on efficiency or convenience; it also turns on fairness
      or justice to the parties.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      third principle is that because a <i>forum non conveniens</i> motion typically
      is brought early in the proceedings, the motion judge should adopt a prudential,
      not an aggressive, approach to fact finding.  As Perell J. said in <i>Tisi
      v. Cornell Trading Inc.</i>, 2006 CanLII 29665 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">

    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    S.C.) at para. 10, wherever possible the motion judge should not “make findings
    of fact about fundamental issues in the action that ought to be resolved
    at a trial”.  Of course, the motion judge should not determine the merits
    of the lawsuit: see <i>Incorporated Broadcasters</i> at para. 54.  Even beyond
    that, however, the motion judge should avoid drawing conclusions or making
    findings on important factual or legal disputes relating to the merits.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Often,
      the motion judge will be faced with two competing versions of facts critical
      to the dispute: the plaintiff’s version and the defendant’s version.  However,
      the motion judge may still be able to resolve the <i>forum non conveniens</i> issue
      without evaluating the relative evidentiary strength of these versions.  For
      instance, the judge may be able to decide whether there is another clearly
      more convenient forum by relying exclusively on uncontested or agreed-upon
      facts: see, e.g., <i>Tisi</i> at para. 10.</span></p>

      on some motions – and this is one of them – the efficiency and fairness
      considerations at the heart of the <i>forum non conveniens</i> test will
      be tied inextricably to the factual issues in dispute.  On these motions,
      the motion judge will have no choice but to address the competing versions
      put forward by the parties.  In doing so, the motion judge should accept
      the plaintiff’s version as long as it has a reasonable basis in the record.  Accepting
      the plaintiff’s version where warranted should not inhibit the motion judge
      from assessing all the evidence in the record and finding facts regarding
      the <i>forum non conveniens</i> factors themselves.  Where the evidence
      is disputed the party relying on a fact supporting the application of a
      factor in its favour will bear the evidential burden of establishing that
      fact: see <i>Frymer v. Brettschneider</i>, [1994] O.J. No. 1411, at para.
      60.</span></p>

      the important point is that at this preliminary stage of the action, the
      motion judge’s assessment and weighing of the <i>forum non conveniens</i> factors
      should be based on the plaintiff’s claim if it has a reasonable basis in
      the record, not on the defendant’s defence to that claim.  This approach

      approach.  He noted that the plaintiffs were seeking an oppression remedy
      under the federal statute, not under the provincial statute.  In his view,
      they were entitled to have the <i>forum non conveniens</i> issue decided
      on the basis of their claim.  He wrote, at para. 54:</span></p>

    my view, the appellants are entitled to have the jurisdiction and convenient

    his interpretation of the
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    Manitoba and federal legislation, in which case the appellants’ action will

      I said in the overview, the motion judge dismissed Young’s version by saying

      terminated, the motion judge also resolved another key aspect of Young’s
      underlying claim adversely to him when he found at para. 24 that Young’s “‘disability’” [quotation

    have had the benefit of reading the reasons of my colleague Laskin J.A. I
    agree with my colleague’s conclusions that the record in this matter discloses
    a reasonable evidentiary basis for Young’s version of his employment in Georgia
    and Indiana and that, in these circumstances, the motion judge erred in principle
    by accepting Tyco’s version and summarily rejecting Young’s version for the
    purpose of the <i>forum non conveniens</i> analysis. I also agree with most
    of my colleague’s review of the law concerning <i>forum non conveniens</i>,
    with his analysis of the <i>forum non conveniens</i> factors in relation
    to Young’s version of his employment, and with my colleague’s proposed disposition
    of this appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    part company with my colleague solely in respect of the thorny problem of
    how a motion judge should proceed when confronted with competing versions
    of facts that are critical not only to the underlying dispute between the
    parties but also to the <i>forum non conveniens</i> analysis. In my view,
    so long as <i>both</i> versions of the critical disputed facts have a reasonable
    evidentiary basis in the record, rather than choosing one version over the
    other, the motion judge should take account of both versions by conducting
    the <i>forum non conveniens</i> analysis in up to three stages. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the first stage, the motion judge may conduct the <i>forum non conveniens</i> analysis
    accepting the plaintiff’s version of the facts. If the defendant’s forum
    is clearly more appropriate even on the plaintiff’s version of the disputed
    facts, the motion judge need proceed no further and should simply stay the
    plaintiff’s proceeding.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the second stage, the motion judge may conduct the <i>forum non conveniens</i> analysis
    accepting the defendant’s version of the disputed facts. Here, the motion
    judge should dismiss the defendant’s request for a stay of proceedings if
    the defendant is unable to establish that its forum is clearly more appropriate
    based on its version of the disputed facts.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Where
    a third stage is necessary because the defendant’s stay motion cannot be
    disposed of at either the first or second stage, the motion judge should
    conduct a <i>forum non conveniens</i> analysis recognizing that certain critical
    facts are in dispute and accepting that both versions have a reasonable prospect
    of being adopted. In effect, in relation to each of the <i>forum non conveniens</i> factors,
    the motion judge should use the findings that would be made in relation to
    that factor at both stages one and two and balance those findings against
    each other. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    third stage will have the disadvantage of effectively neutralizing the <i>forum
    non conveniens</i> connecting factors that turn on the critical disputed
    facts. In practice, that may often mean that the first six of the seven <i>forum
    non conveniens</i> factors will be neutral.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a> However, where both versions of the facts have
    a reasonable foundation in the evidence and where the stay motion cannot
    be disposed of by either a stage one or a stage two analysis, issues about
    one forum or the other being inappropriate and forum shopping will be dispelled. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>What
    the third stage will do is preserve for the motion judge the opportunity
    of considering any potential injustice or unfairness to the defendant arising
    from being forced to litigate in the plaintiff’s chosen forum. Once again,
    the motion judge should dismiss the defendant’s request for a stay of proceedings
    if the defendant is unable to establish that its forum is clearly more appropriate.
    In the end, the only realistic basis for displacing a plaintiff’s choice
    of forum on a stage three analysis is likely to be unfairness to the defendant
    if compelled to litigate in the plaintiff’s forum that clearly outweighs
    any unfairness to the plaintiff if compelled to litigate in the defendant’s
    forum.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US> </span>I
    reach my conclusion concerning this approach for three reasons. First, the <i>forum
    non conveniens</i> analysis is rooted at least in part in the principle of
    attempting to avoid injustice to either party: see <i>Amchem Products Inc.
    v. British Columbia (Workers Compensation Board)</i>, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 897,
    at pp. 915-922.  Where both parties’ versions of  the  critical  events  have  a  reasonable
    foundation  in  the  record,  an  approach  that disregards completely one
    party’s version of the events creates a risk of unfairness to that party.  Respectfully,
    this risk can readily be avoided by adopting a more flexible approach. Although
    I conclude that no such unfairness exists in this case, that does not obviate
    my concern in relation to other cases. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    I am not persuaded that this court’s decision in <i>Incorporated Broadcasters
    Ltd. v. Canwest Global Communications Corp.</i> (2003), 63 O.R. (3d) 431
    mandates an approach under which only the plaintiff’s version of the facts
    is considered. In <i>Canwest</i>, Rosenberg J.A. concluded that the defendant’s
    forum was clearly more appropriate based on the plaintiffs’ formulation of
    their claim.  In these circumstances, it was unnecessary for Justice Rosenberg
    to consider whether further analysis was required since the issue was disposed
    of on a stage one analysis.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third,
    although my approach may be more cumbersome than that of my colleague, it
    is not so cumbersome as to dictate a different result. As a practical matter,
    most plaintiffs will not likely advance a stage two argument and a stage
    two analysis will therefore be unnecessary. In these circumstances, the only
    real difference between my colleague’s approach and my approach is likely
    to be that the motion judge will have to consider the seventh <i>forum non
    conveniens</i> factor (loss of legitimate juridical advantage) taking account
    of both parties’ versions of events. This is because stage one of my approach
    is the same as my colleague’s approach (except that further analysis is required
    if the defendant is not successful at stage one), and because the first six
    of the seven <i>forum non conveniens</i> factors are likely to be neutralized
    in a stage three analysis.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>B.        Application of My
      Approach to the Facts of this Case</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US> </span>As
    I have said, I agree with my colleague’s conclusion that the record in this
    matter discloses a reasonable evidentiary basis for Young’s version of his
    employment in Georgia and Indiana. I also agree with the motion judge’s implicit
    finding that Tyco’s version of Young’s employment has a reasonable evidentiary
    foundation. I would therefore conduct the <i>forum non conveniens</i> analysis
    taking account of both parties’ versions of Young’s employment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My
    colleague has essentially dealt with what I call the stage one and two analyses.
    My colleague conducted a <i>forum non conveniens</i> analysis accepting Young’s
    version of his employment, which, on my approach, is a stage one analysis.
    My colleague concluded that three of the <i>forum non conveniens</i> factors
    favour
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario, four are neutral, and that, in the result,
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Indiana is not a clearly more appropriate forum. I agree with these findings.
    On the other hand, as my colleague explained, when the trial judge accepted
    Tyco’s version of Young’s employment, the <i>forum non conveniens</i> factors
    pointed virtually exclusively to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Indiana as the more appropriate forum. I would call this a stage two analysis.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    move then to a stage three analysis on my approach. On the facts of this
    case, if one accepts that both parties’ versions of Young’s employment have
    a reasonable prospect of being accepted as true, six of the seven <i>forum
    non conveniens</i> factors become neutral. The governing contract may have
    been entered into either in Illinois or Ontario; the law of either Ontario
    or Indiana may apply; the location of witness and evidence factors become
    neutral for the reasons my colleague explained when accepting Young’s version
    of his employment; factual matters arose both in Ontario and in Indiana;
    and the parties are spread amongst jurisdictions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    issue boils down then to the question of loss of legitimate juridical advantage.
    As my colleague explained, on Young’s version of his employment, there are
    two juridical advantages to him in proceeding in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario. First is the fact that
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario judges are familiar with assessing damages for wrongful dismissal.
    The second is Young’s improved access to justice if permitted to proceed
    in this jurisdiction. On Young’s version of his employment, his claim has
    a strong connection to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario and he is legitimately entitled to these advantages. However, he
    will lose these advantages if compelled to proceed in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Indiana.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning
    to Tyco, the sole juridical advantage it claims if its version of Young’s
    employment is accepted is the practical benefit of having an action governed
    by
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Indiana law tried in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Indiana. In these circumstances, the disadvantage Tyco will experience if
    compelled to litigate in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario does not clearly outweigh the prejudice Young will suffer if compelled
    to litigate in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Indiana.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    Ontario judges may not have experience in applying Indiana employment law,
    given that Indiana is an “at will”
    jurisdiction, its laws relating to the issues in this case are unlikely to
    be difficult for a judge hearing the case in this province to apply. Moreover,
    for the reasons my colleague explained, if compelled to litigate in Ontario
    Tyco is unlikely to experience the access to justice problems Young will
    experience if compelled to litigate in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Indiana.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    Tyco has not demonstrated that
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Indiana is clearly the more appropriate forum, I would allow the appeal,
    set aside the motion judge’s order staying Young’s action, and dismiss Tyco’s
    motion.</p>
