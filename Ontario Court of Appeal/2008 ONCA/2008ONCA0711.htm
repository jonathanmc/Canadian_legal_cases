  <h2>A.        <u>INTRODUCTION</u></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Sometimes a person serving a conditional
    sentence in the community gets into more trouble.  He breaches a condition of his sentence (for
    example, a curfew) or by, as in this case, committing a new criminal offence.  When this happens, there is a process
    established by the <i>Criminal Code</i> for
    converting the remainder of the conditional sentence to a custodial
    sentence.  This court has stated that
    “there is urgency in holding a hearing alleging a breach of a conditional
    sentence”: see <i>R. v. Greville</i> (2002),
    158 O.A.C. 183 at para. 12.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The principal issue on this appeal is the
    interpretation of s. 742.6(3)(a) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> which requires that a hearing relating to an allegation of a breach of
    condition of a sentence be held within 30 days of “the offender’s arrest”.  The main question raised in this appeal is
    which of the three following events triggers the running of the 30 day time
    period:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the offender’s arrest on the new offence with
    which he has been charged while serving his conditional sentence;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the issuing of the warrant of arrest for the
    charge of breach of condition; or</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>3)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the execution of the warrant on the offender.</p>
  <h2>B.        <u>FACTS</u></h2>
  <h2>            (1)
          <u>The parties and events</u></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On November 17, 2006, the appellant, Tommy
    Kabosos, was convicted of break and enter with intent to commit an indictable
    offence, failure to comply with probation, and two counts of break and enter
    theft.  He was given a 12 month
    conditional sentence and a two year probation order.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Five weeks later, on December 22, 2006, the
    appellant was arrested and charged with break and enter with intent to commit
    an indictable offence, possession of break-in instruments, and possession of
    property obtained by crime of $5,000, all stemming from an incident in Bolton.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On January 24, 2007, the supervisor of the
    appellant’s conditional sentence prepared the documents for a breach of
    condition charge.  On January 31, the
    warrant for the appellant’s arrest was issued, and on February 23, the warrant
    was executed (i.e. served on the appellant).</p>
  <h2>(2)       <u>The
    hearing</u></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The hearing relating to the alleged breach of
    condition took place on March 28, 2007 – 96 days after the appellant’s arrest
    for the new offences, 56 days after the warrant was issued, and 33 days after
    the warrant was executed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge was called upon to interpret s.
    742.6(3) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> which
    provides:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>742.6(3)
            The hearing of an allegation of a
    breach of condition shall be commenced within thirty days, or as soon
    thereafter as is practicable, after </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(a)       the offender’s arrest; or</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(b)       the compelling of the offender’s appear-ance
    in accordance with paragraph (1)(d).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It appears that both counsel accepted that the
    30 day period commenced after the warrant for the appellant’s arrest for breach
    of condition was executed on the appellant.  Accordingly, the only issue was whether the 33 days between execution of
    the warrant and commencement of the hearing was “as soon … as is practicable”
    after the 30 day period prescribed by the provision.  On this issue, the trial judge agreed with
    the Crown.  He said that “[w]hile there
    has been some delay and some failure in the communication between the two
    levels of court”, the 33 day delay was close to the statutory 30 day period and
    was as soon as is practicable.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On appeal, the appellant, with the generous and
    capable assistance of duty counsel, raised two issues, one relating to the
    triggering event for a s. 742.6 hearing and the other relating to the
    interpretation of the words “as soon thereafter as is practicable”.</p>
  <h2>C.        <u>ISSUES</u></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The issues are:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When does the 30 day period for a hearing of an
    allegation of breach of condition commence?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Irrespective of the answer to (1), did the
    hearing in this case take place as soon as practicable after the expiration of
    the statutory 30 day period?</p>
  <h2>D.        <u>ANALYSIS</u></h2>
  <h2>            (1)       <u>The trigger for the breach of condition
    hearing</u></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There are three possible triggers for the
    commencement of the 30 day period in s. 742.6(3) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  In
    chronological order, the possibilities are: the arrest of the offender for the new
    offence; the issuance of the warrant of arrest for breach of condition; and the
    execution of the warrant.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Duty counsel contended that the issuance of the
    warrant should trigger the 30 day time period.  She acknowledged that this event did not amount to “the arrest” of the
    offender, but submitted that the policy underlying s. 742.6 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> is to deal with alleged
    breaches of conditions on an urgent basis: see <i>Greville, </i>at para. 12.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Duty counsel also pointed out that, by virtue of
    s. 742.6(10) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>,
    the running of the conditional sentence is potentially suspended from “the
    issuance of a warrant for the arrest of the offender for the alleged
    breach”.  Duty counsel submitted that if
    the trigger date for the 30 day period is the warrant execution, there will be
    no incentive on the police to execute the warrant in a timely fashion at
    precisely the time during which the conditional sentence has been suspended.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I admit that there is some force to these
    submissions.  However, in the end I do
    not accept them, essentially for two reasons.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First, the wording of s. 742.6(3) is clear.  The 30 day period leading up to the
    commencement of the breach hearing is triggered by “the offender’s
    arrest”.  The arrest of the offender on
    the new offence is an arrest.  So is the
    execution of the warrant which compels the offender to appear to answer the
    charge of breach of condition.  However,
    the issuance of the warrant is not an arrest; it compels nothing of the
    offender until he receives it.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second, in my view an answer to the argument
    about delay by the police in executing the warrant can be found in s. 742.6
    (14) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>742.6(14)
          Despite subsection (10), if there
    was unreasonable delay in the execution of a warrant, the court may, at any
    time, order that any period between the issuance and execution of the warrant
    that it considers appropriate in the interests of justice is deemed to be time
    served under the conditional sentence order …</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>This provision, coupled with the
    policy underlying the provision and judicial statements in cases like <i>Greville</i>, combine to ensure that the
    police and court administrators will not delay steps they must take in an
    alleged breach of condition scenario.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This leaves a final question: does “the
    offender’s arrest” as stated in s. 742.6(3)(a) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> refer to the appellant’s December 22, 2006 arrest for
    the new offence, or to his arrest on February 23, 2007 for a breach of his
    conditional sentence?</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In my view, the answer is obvious; the relevant
    date is when the warrant is executed.<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  Section 742.6 is entitled <i>Procedure on Breach of Condition</i> and
    contains the subheading <i>Warrant or arrest
    – suspension of running of conditional sentence</i>.  Further, the entire provision deals with a
    specific offence: the breach of condition of a sentence.  In addition, there will be some cases (not
    this one) where the offender commits no new offence; all he does is breach a
    condition of the sentence he is already serving.  Accordingly, both the wording and the logic
    of s. 742.6 compel the conclusion that “the offender’s arrest” in s.
    742.6(3)(a) refers to his arrest for breach of condition, not for the new
    offence.  In this respect, I agree with
    what Karakatsanis J. said in one of the very few cases dealing with s.
    742.6(3), <i>R. v. Beckles</i>, [2007] O.J.
    2799 (S.C.) at para. 9: “In my view, it is clear that the arrest referred to in
    s. 742.6(3)(a) is the arrest for the alleged breach of condition.  The section deals with procedure on breach of
    condition and provides for the arrest, release, hearing, and powers of the court
    with respect to the breach and conditional sentence.”</p>
  <h2>(2)       <u>“As
    soon … as is practicable”</u></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant’s alternative argument is that a
    33 day delay between the execution of the warrant and the commencement of the
    breach hearing is outside the 30 day period prescribed by s. 742.6(3) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> and that the Crown has not
    demonstrated that the extra three days came within the “as soon thereafter as
    is practicable” extension of the 30 day period.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>With respect, I disagree.  The appellant was detained on the charges for
    the new offences; accordingly, he suffered no prejudice with respect to the
    custodial time relating to the breach of condition charge.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover, in many cases, including this one, the
    new offences will be proceeding in provincial court while the breach of
    condition charge will require a hearing in superior court.  This will require communication and
    co-operation between two court levels.  As
    expressed by Weiler J.A. in <i>Greville</i> at para. 12, “some flexibility is required to accommodate the realities of a
    new case entering the system.”  It may
    well be that “some flexibility” will not accommodate delays of 57 days, <i>R. v. Cruz</i>, [2001] O.J. No. 3756 (S.C.),
    or 111 days, <i>R. v. Laviola</i>, [2005]
    O.J. No. 5712 (S.C.).  However, an
    additional three days in a case involving several charges and two court levels
    does not strike me as being unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, I observe that the trial judge gave the
    appellant credit for 30 days for the time served before the commencement of the
    breach of condition hearing even though the appellant was detained on the new
    offence charges.  This implicit
    invocation of s. 742.6(14) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> strikes me as an appropriate counterbalance to a three day delay in
    commencing the breach of condition hearing.</p>
  <h2>E.        <u>DISPOSITION</u></h2>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
