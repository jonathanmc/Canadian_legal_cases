  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On October 30, 2004, the complainant, James Stewart, responded
    to an advertisement in Auto Trader describing a motorcycle for sale as a “1998

    – Like new ... 11,000 km.”  Mr. Stewart
    attended at the appellants’ residence and was shown the bike by Gus Bakos.  On November 1, 2004, Mr. Stewart returned to
    the residence and gave Gus Bakos’ brother, Alexander Bakos, $7,300 cash for the
    motorcycle.  Alexander Bakos provided Mr.
    Stewart with an ownership certificate for the motorcycle.  The certificate, which Alexander Bakos
    endorsed on the reverse, was in the name of a Mr. Chinery.  When Mr. Stewart tried to register the
    motorcycle in his name and this documentation was not accepted, he sought help
    from the appellants.  Although the
    appellants said they would assist, they did not do so.  To facilitate registration of the bike, Mr.
    Stewart presented the Ministry of Transportation with a false affidavit saying
    that he had lost his wallet, which he said contained the necessary
    documents.  To reduce the taxes payable,
    he also provided the Ministry with a receipt that indicated that he had only
    paid $4,500 for the bike.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In January 2005, Mr. Stewart took the motorcycle to
    Canadian Tire to obtain a safety standards certificate.  The mechanic at Canadian Tire became suspicious
    regarding the ownership of the motorcycle.  His suspicions were aroused by a number of components of the bike,
    including its tires, which appeared to have been worn from racing.  The subsequent police investigation led to
    the charges against the appellants.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2000, Gus Bakos bought a 1998 Yamaha from a Mr.
    Chinery for $2,000.  The price
    represented the salvage value of the motorcycle that had been involved in a
    serious accident and was inoperable.  The
    motorcycle Mr. Stewart brought to Canadian Tire in January 2005 had a Vehicle
    Identification Number (VIN), which appeared to match that of Mr. Chinery’s motorcycle,
    but also contained components from a motorcycle that had been stolen from a Mr.
    Dennis in the latter half of June 2004.  The components included the fairings from Mr. Dennis’ motorcycle, the
    motorcycle’s xenon headlights, as well as at least the rear tire, a Pilot 190.  Mr. Dennis also identified a large dent near
    the gas tank of the Stewart motorcycle, as well as two holes drilled into the
    fairing under the seat, as being identical to the dent and holes in his bike.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Police Officer Gallant, an experienced officer with the
    auto squad, testified for the Crown that the Federal Certification label was
    missing from the Stewart motorcycle, which suggested to him an attempt to try
    to conceal the identity of the motorcycle.  Moreover, Officer Gallant noted that the first five digits of the engine
    number on the Stewart motorcycle, which is distinct from the VIN number, matched
    the first five digits of the engine number on the Dennis motorcycle.  However, the defence challenged this
    testimony on the basis that there was no evidence about the engine number of
    the Chinery motorcycle.  Officer Gallant
    also testified that a rebuilt vehicle, such as the Stewart motorcycle, required
    a rebuilt title from the Ministry of Transportation.  The appellants did not obtain a rebuilt
    title.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Stewart testified about his interactions with the
    Bakos brothers after his purchase of the motorcycle on November 1, 2004.  Apart from his unsuccessful attempts to
    enlist their help in the registration process, Mr. Stewart went to the Bakos
    residence about one month after the purchase in search of a new headlight and
    fairing.  He testified that although Gus
    Bakos produced several parts, Mr. Stewart was “weirded out” by his behaviour,
    including Gus Bakos’ production of “three identical sets of bike stuff that he
    doesn’t even own that bike anymore” and his conduct of going through the house to
    the garage to retrieve components rather than opening the garage door.  In Mr. Stewart’s words, he “got out of
    there.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, the defence challenged Mr. Stewart’s
    credibility on a number of bases, including the false receipt he requested from
    the Bakos brothers for his purchase of the motorcycle, his filing of a false
    affidavit to further registration of his ownership and his challenged explanation
    of losing his wallet over the winter months.  There was no issue at trial that Mr. Stewart told lies on earlier
    occasions.  It was the defence position
    that as a result Mr. Stewart’s evidence was unreliable and that it had been Mr.
    Stewart who installed the stolen components on the motorcycle after he had
    purchased it from the Bakos brothers. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial was brief and uncomplicated.  The evidence took less than two days.  It began at approximately 3:00 p.m. on Monday
    afternoon and ended by the lunch recess on Wednesday.  Counsel engaged in lengthy pre-charge
    discussions with the trial judge on Wednesday and part of Thursday, during
    which they reached a general agreement on the contents of the charge.  Counsel addressed the jury later on
    Thursday.  The trial judge then charged
    the jury.  The jury retired to consider
    its verdict on Friday at 11:41 a.m.  There were no objections to the charge and the jury asked no questions.  The jury returned with its verdict at 4:15
    p.m.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I will deal with each of the appellants’ challenges in
    turn.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>CONVICTION APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before discussing the specific challenges to the trial
    judge’s charge, it is helpful to put those challenges in context.  The trial judge explained to the jury in
    clear terms the essential elements that the Crown was required to prove.  The trial, and defence counsels’ addresses,
    focused on whether the Crown had proven that the appellants possessed the
    stolen components and had incorporated them into the Stewart motorcycle.  Since it was the defence position that Mr.
    Stewart was an incorrigible liar whose evidence could not be believed and that
    Mr. Stewart had the stolen components incorporated into his motorcycle after he
    purchased it from the appellants, it would have been clear to the members of
    the jury that they were required to make factual determinations about the
    history of the stolen components and the timing of their incorporation into the
    Stewart motorcycle.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants now challenge the trial judge’s
    instructions on various issues.  In
    considering these challenges, I observe that both defence counsel at trial were
    content with the charge.  Thus, it
    appears that these issues, raised for the first time on appeal, did not concern
    trial counsel and that trial counsel did not see the charge as compromising
    trial fairness in any way. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Charges should not be parsed, but read as a whole.  They must also be considered in the context
    of the factual issues raised in the trial and the law related to those
    issues.  In this case, the trial judge
    instructed the jury that if they found that the appellants were not in
    possession of the Dennis components, they were required to acquit the
    appellants.  The jury was provided with
    decision trees painstakingly reviewed with counsel, which took the jury through
    the steps of the required decision-making process. Those decision trees were
    essentially the same as those set out in <i><span lang=EN-US style='color:black;'>Watt’s
    Manual of Criminal Jury Instructions</span></i><span lang=EN-US
style='color:black;'> (Toronto: Thomson Canada Limited, 2005), at pp.
    654-55</span>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, the jury instructions given by the trial
    judge were tailored to the specific requests of counsel.  For example, they included the core defence
    position that the appellants never had possession of the stolen components and
    their position that, if the components were stolen, which they denied, it was
    Mr. Stewart who had incorporated them into his motorcycle.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge told the jury that his instructions on
    recent possession had no application unless the jury first concluded that the
    appellants had been in possession of the stolen components.  He correctly explained the inference the jury
    could draw, emphasizing that the jury first had to determine that the
    appellants’ possession was recent before they could choose whether to exercise
    their discretion to draw the available inference.  Later in the charge, just prior to the jury’s
    deliberations, the trial judge reminded the jury that the defence took the
    position the parts were not stolen and that, if they were stolen, they were
    added to the motorcycle by Stewart after its purchase.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown argued that the circumstantial evidence given
    to the jury suggested that, working in concert, the appellants sold the Stewart
    motorcycle complete with stolen components and that the appellants’ conduct was
    such that the jury could reasonably conclude that the appellants knew the
    components were stolen.  The Crown also
    argued that the condition of the tires suggested that the Stewart bike had been
    used over the intervening months for racing, an activity denied by each of Mr.
    Chinery, Mr. Dennis and Mr. Stewart. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge told the jury to consider all the
    evidence, including the appellants’ conduct and what they said and did not say,
    in determining the appellants’ state of mind.  That evidence included the appellants’ purchase of the damaged Chinery
    motorcycle for cash, the theft of the Dennis motorcycle, the sale of the
    motorcycle to Stewart, the falsification of the receipt, the failure of the
    appellants to transfer the Chinery motorcycle to their name, the VIN number of
    the Stewart motorcycle that matched that of the Chinery motorcycle, the absence
    of a Federal Certification label, the identification of specific components of
    the Dennis motorcycle in the Stewart rebuilt motorcycle, the failure of the
    appellants to obtain a rebuilt title, and Gus Bakos’ conduct in dealing in
    motorcycle parts, including the apparent concealment of the contents of the
    garage.  Irrespective of the now challenged
    aspects of the trial judge’s charge, this was ample evidence upon which the
    jury could conclude that the Crown had proven its case beyond a reasonable
    doubt.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, the appellants challenge the wording of two
    specific parts of the trial judge’s instructions and argue that two other
    issues ought to have been addressed by the trial judge. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the charge is challenged on the basis that the
    instruction regarding recent possession failed to provide the criteria from
    which the jury could establish the third element required for application of
    the doctrine: “recentness”.  On the issue
    of how “recency” is to be determined, it is important to note that both defence
    counsel agreed at the pre-charge conference, if the jury attributed possession
    to the appellants, that the doctrine of recent possession would apply, that
    four plus months was within the range to qualify as “recent”, and that whether
    that period actually qualified was a question of fact for the jury to decide. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In support of their argument, the appellants rely on <i>Saieva v. The Queen</i> (1982), 68 C.C.C.
    (2d) 97, in which the Supreme Court of Canada considered “recency” on the basis
    of the relevant factors, including the rareness of the object, the readiness
    with which it is likely to pass from hand to hand, its transferability and its
    ease of identification.  However, <i>Saieva</i> involved different circumstances and
    raised different issues than those present in this case.  Moreover, the theft in <i>Saieva</i> could have occurred 50 to 55 weeks before the
    possession.  Also in <i>Saieva</i>, there was no evidence about the date of theft and, in order
    to establish a date, it was necessary to consider “intricate facts” about how
    the stolen property was used before the theft.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, there was no dispute about when and where
    the theft occurred.  Here, the possession
    of the stolen components by the appellants was alleged to be within four and a
    half months of the theft.  The date when
    the components came into Mr. Stewart’s possession was also clear.  Indeed, the gap between the theft and the
    appellants’ possession is shorter than the four plus months described because the
    appellants must have had the components at an earlier time in order to
    incorporate them into the Stewart motorcycle and advertise it for sale.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any event, while <i>Saieva</i> required the trial judge to provide the jury with the criteria for determining
    “recency”, in my view those criteria were adequately delivered to the jury in
    this case when the charge is considered as a whole.  The jury had extensive evidence about the
    Chinery sale, the Dennis theft, the amalgamation of the two motorcycles into
    the Stewart motorcycle, the possible use made of the Dennis motorcycle in the
    summer of 2004 and the appellants’ possession of the components for a period of
    time before the sale to Stewart.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US style='color:black;'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The nature of the issues in this trial and the components
    of the offences were clear to the jury.  The factual issues and the applicable law were reviewed in detail in the
    trial judge’s charge. This was not a complicated trial requiring a detailed
    explanation of “recent”: see also <i><span
lang=EN-US style='color:black;'>Watt</span></i><span lang=EN-US style='color:black;'> at pp.
    649-58.  </span>Further, in my view, the
    Crown was not compelled, as suggested in oral argument, to call expert
    evidence, if such evidence was available, on the transferability in practice of
    stolen motorcycle components when taken by a dealer for inclusion in a rebuilt
    motorcycle.  I would not give effect to
    this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the appellant challenges the trial judge’s
    instruction to the jury regarding wilful blindness.  This aspect of the charge was also discussed
    in the pre-charge conference and no objection was taken after the charge.  On this issue, the trial judge correctly
    charged the jury when he described wilful blindness as comprising aroused
    suspicions on the part of the appellants and deliberate omission to make
    further inquiries.  However, the appellants
    argue that the trial judge erred earlier in the same paragraph when he described
    wilful blindness as “good reason to believe the property was stolen”.  In my view, it would have been better if the
    trial judge had not alluded to one element of wilful blindness, suspicion,
    without connecting it to the second element, a conscious decision not to make
    inquiries.  Nonetheless, immediately afterwards,
    the trial judge correctly explained the two components.  Accordingly, reading the paragraph as a
    whole, the jury would have understood the two components required to establish
    wilful blindness.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The appellants
    also argue that there were no factual underpinnings for a wilful blindness
    instruction.  No specific underpinnings
    were recited by the trial judge; however, he did tell the jury that “if you are
    satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused knew the property was
    stolen, this essential element has been proven.”  Wilful blindness, like recent possession, is
    a direction to the jury to exercise their common sense in drawing reasonable inferences
    from the available evidence.  In the case
    of wilful blindness, an inference can be drawn that the person must have been
    suspicious, yet deliberately chose to ignore the provenance of the object at
    issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, irrespective of any application of the
    term wilful blindness, there was ample evidence from which the jury could infer
    the appellants’ knowledge that the components they inserted into the Stewart
    motorcycle were stolen.  That evidence
    included the appellants’ failure to document the transfer of the motorcycle,
    their failure to obtain a rebuilt title from the Ministry of Transportation,
    and their lack of response to Mr. Stewart’s pleas for assistance with transferring
    the ownership.  I would not give effect
    to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, the appellants argue that the trial judge was
    obliged to exercise his discretion to give a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning regarding Mr. Stewart’s evidence.  Apart from the fact that no such warning was
    requested, in my view, the trial judge repeatedly and adequately warned the
    jury about Mr. Stewart’s credibility, including his lies about the purchase
    price of the motorcycle, the lies contained in his affidavit, and his
    prevarication about the loss of his wallet.  Indeed, this case was essentially about Mr. Stewart’s credibility.  This would have been clearly understood by
    the jury.  There was no need for a
    specific <i>Vetrovec</i> warning. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth, the appellants argue that the trial judge
    instructed the jury about after-the-fact conduct and that his charge was
    inadequate in light of the omission of an instruction regarding innocent
    explanation.  However, while the trial
    judge referred to the appellants’ failure to assist with the registration and
    Gus Bakos’ conduct on Mr. Stewart’s return visit, he did so as one piece of the
    whole of the evidence.  At its highest,
    the trial judge instructed the jury to use their common sense in looking at all
    the evidence by considering all that was said and not said and all that was
    done and not done in relation to this transaction both before and after the
    sale of the motorcycle.  In the
    circumstances of this case, a specific caution was not necessary.  I also note that the defence requested no
    specific instruction and raised no objection to the charge given to the
    jury.  I would not give effect to this
    ground of appeal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, I would dismiss the conviction
    appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>SENTENCE APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am not persuaded that the conditional sentences were
    demonstrably unfit or that the trial judge made any error in principle or took
    into account any improper factors in arriving either at the sentences or at the
    restitution order.  Indeed, in my view,
    the sentences were at the low end of the range having regard to the offences
    and the circumstances of the offenders.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, while I would grant leave to appeal
    sentence, I would also dismiss the sentence appeal. </p>
