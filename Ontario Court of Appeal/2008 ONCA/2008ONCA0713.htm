    is an appeal from the appellant’s conviction for second degree murder, which
    followed a two-week jury trial presided over by Shaughnessy J.  The appellant
    admitted he shot and killed his wife in the kitchen of their home on the
    evening of November 19, 2000.  The appellant defended on the basis of accident,
    taking the position that he did not know the gun was loaded when he pointed
    it at the kitchen door and pulled the trigger.  Thus, it was the defence
    position that the appellant did not intend to kill his wife. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues two grounds of appeal: first, that the trial judge erred
    in admitting the videotaped statement the appellant gave at the police station
    on the basis that the statement was tainted by the circumstances of the appellant’s
    earlier statements in the police cruiser; and second, that the trial judge
    erred in his instructions to the jury regarding the defence of accident as
    it relates to the issue of the appellant’s intent and the availability of
    a manslaughter verdict.  I would not give effect to either ground of appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Regarding
    the first ground, I see no error in the trial judge’s conclusion that the
    appellant’s videotaped statement at the police station was not tainted by
    the circumstances surrounding his earlier statements in the police cruiser.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge held the earlier cruiser statements, taken after the appellant’s
    6:16 p.m. arrest on assault and weapons charges, were inadmissible.  Those
    statements included the appellant’s stating that the shooting was an unintended
    accident, that he did not expect the gun to go off, that he did not think
    he could shoot or think that straight, that he was a gunsmith, that he was
    cleaning his gun, that his wife had “started bugging me” and that he had
    previously been of assistance to the police.  In response to specific questions
    from a police officer about the ownership and type of gun, the appellant
    admitted it was his gun and said that it was a “.38 police special”.  The
    trial judge ruled the police cruiser statements inadmissible because the
    Crown failed to prove voluntariness and reliability.  In the cruiser, the
    experienced police officer, in contravention of the appellant’s s. 10(b) <i>Charter</i> rights,
    specifically asked the appellant about the gun “[k]nowing full well that
    the accused wanted to consult with his lawyer”.  The trial judge had further
    concerns about the reliability and trustworthiness of the appellant’s statements
    in the cruiser because the police officer typed his notes with his right
    hand at the same time that he was driving the cruiser.  The trial judge concluded
    that the admission of the cruiser statements would tend to render the trial
    unfair.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defence challenged the admissibility of the appellant’s subsequent statement
    videotaped at the police station.  While much of that statement was exculpatory,
    its numerous inconsistencies were not helpful to the appellant.  When the
    appellant arrived at the police station at approximately 6:49 p.m., the police
    took him to an interview room with working videotape equipment.  Commendably,
    the entirety of the appellant’s contact with the police in the interview
    room was recorded.  The police promptly advised the appellant that he was
    now charged with murder and cautioned him about his rights.  At that time,
    the police did not caution the appellant not to be influenced by anything
    he had said earlier to other officers when he was in the cruiser.  The police
    were initially unsuccessful in contacting the appellant’s counsel of choice,
    Ms. Boyd.  However, the appellant spoke to duty counsel by telephone for
    about 14 minutes at 7:59 p.m.  The police later located Ms. Boyd and the
    appellant spoke with her at 8:59 p.m. for about five minutes.  The appellant
    later met for about 30 minutes with another lawyer, Mr. Cooke, at 11:30 p.m.  In
    total, the appellant consulted with three different counsel for over 50 minutes
    in a four-hour period, during which time the police made no effort to question
    him except about the victim’s next-of-kin.  Not until 12:54 a.m. did Detective
    Torrie interview and take a statement from the appellant.  The interview
    concluded at 3:14 a.m.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    ruling that the appellant’s videotaped statement was admissible, the trial
    judge recognized that Detective Torrie was not involved in the appellant’s
    statements in the cruiser.  After discussion about a number of preliminary
    issues, the appellant willingly talked about the shooting.  He gave various
    contradictory accounts of his actions and those of his wife, whether he knew
    the gun was loaded or he had loaded the gun that evening, how he reacted
    or even knew about a telephone call his wife made to a male friend, the amount
    of alcohol<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a> consumed by his wife on the evening of the shooting,
    his reactions to the telephone call and his wife’s drinking, his knowledge
    of guns, the mechanics of the .38 calibre gun in question, and his repeated
    statement that the shooting was an accident.  The appellant explained that
    he had pointed the gun at the kitchen door with the intention of scaring,
    not shooting, his wife.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    ruling the statement admissible, the trial judge noted that “there is nothing
    in the confessions rule which prohibits the police from questioning the accused
    in the absence of counsel after the accused has contacted or retained counsel.”  He
    also concluded that there was nothing in the manner or duration of questioning
    that raised an element of oppression and that the appellant willingly volunteered
    information, even though he knew that he was not required to talk to the
    police and that he had been advised by counsel not to do so.  The trial judge
    also recognized that the questions asked by the police were, for the most
    part, simple and straightforward and appropriate to the appellant’s limited
    cognitive abilities and that there was no police attempt to use aggressive
    techniques or non-existing or fabricated evidence to elicit answers from
    the appellant.  The appellant was not asked any questions about the statements
    he gave in the cruiser.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    appeal, the appellant argues that the station statement was tainted by the
    circumstances of the earlier cruiser statement.  While not determinative,
    raising this issue for the first time on appeal suggests that the issue of
    tainting was not of significant concern to trial counsel.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    any event, in our view, the police station statement was not tainted by the
    earlier cruiser statement.  It was taken more than six hours after the appellant
    was advised of the new charges of murder.  The statement, which was extensive,
    was taken in a different location by a different officer after the appellant
    had been given his right to counsel, had consulted three different lawyers
    and had acknowledged that he understood he was not required to answer the
    officer’s questions.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    officer who took the cruiser statement was not present during the station
    interview and, indeed, had left the station some two hours earlier.  During
    the course of the station interview, the appellant willingly volunteered
    information, sometimes without prompting.  The interviewing officer did not
    refer to nor rely on the cruiser statement in his questioning of the appellant,
    nor was there anything in the cruiser statement that would have compelled
    the appellant to want to give a further explanation to the police.  In both
    interviews, the appellant consistently maintained that the shooting was an
    accident.  Accordingly, there was no nexus between the cruiser and station
    statements.  In my view, the station statement was a “fresh start” in accordance
    with the principles discussed in <i>R. v. Plaha</i> (2004), 188 C.C.C. (3d)
    289 (Ont. C.A.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    it would undoubtedly have been ideal, with the benefit of hindsight, if Detective
    Torrie had also cautioned the appellant not to be influenced by anything
    he had said earlier to other officers, such a caution was not required in
    the circumstances of this case where the combination of the temporal, causal
    and contextual connections between the two statements was so weak.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Regarding
    the second ground, the appellant argues that the trial judge, who he concedes
    otherwise instructed the jury properly on the defence of accident in relation
    to causation and unlawful act, erred in instructing the jury regarding the
    defence of accident as it relates to the issue of the appellant’s intent
    and the availability of a manslaughter verdict.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    was not a complicated trial.  The jury knew that intent was the central issue
    and that it was the position of the defence that the appellant did not intend
    to kill his wife because he did not know or appreciate that the gun was loaded
    and in light of his position that the bullet must have ricocheted off another
    object. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition to forensic evidence, the jury had the appellant’s 9-1-1 call and
    the videotape to assist them with the appellant’s intention.  In those statements,
    the appellant admitted that he had shot his wife in the head, that he was
    going to shoot himself rather than go to jail, that he had a .38 calibre
    police gun, that he had been upset by his wife, that he had pointed the gun,
    that he had intended to scare his wife, that he had pulled the trigger and
    that the shot from the gun had killed his wife.  On several occasions in
    his statements, the appellant said that the shooting was an accident and
    that he had not intended to kill his wife.  Thus, the only issues at trial
    were whether the appellant knew the gun was loaded, where he aimed the gun
    when he pulled the trigger and his intention in doing so.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    jury also had the defence expert evidence about the appellant’s cognitive
    impairment and whether that level of impairment affected either his statements
    or his intent.  However, based on the appellant’s ability to maintain consistent
    employment for 37 years, his scores on cognitive testing, and his demeanour
    and responses to the questions posed, the expert was unable to give an opinion
    that supported the defence position.  Although the defence still argued in
    closing that the appellant was “borderline mentally retarded”, which should
    be taken into account in determining the issue of his intent, the trial judge
    instructed the jury that the evidence did not support this argument.  The
    defence neither objected to this instruction nor raised the issue on appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this context, the trial judge instructed the jury on the issue of intent,
    making it clear that the jury could not convict the appellant of murder unless
    the Crown had proven the specific intent required.  The trial judge told
    the jury that if the appellant did not mean to kill his wife, or did not
    mean to cause her bodily harm with its likely consequences, the appellant
    would not be guilty of murder.  The trial judge explained this a number of
    times in different ways.  While it would have been better if the trial judge
    had given more explicit instructions for unlawful act manslaughter, the jury
    would have been left in no doubt about the required intent before it reached
    a verdict or murder and not manslaughter.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the course of his instructions on intent, the trial judge reviewed the evidence,
    including the appellant’s inconsistencies in his statement and his repeated
    assertion of accident.  The trial judge addressed the “test for intent under
    s. 229(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>”.  To help the jury “understand that
    intent” he took them to their jury booklet and drew their attention to the
    required intent.  He concluded this portion of his charge by repeating that
    intent is required for murder and told the jury that if the Crown had not
    proved that intent, and the jury found unlawful act, their verdict would
    be manslaughter.  Specifically, he instructed the jury and the jury would
    have understood that:  “[i]f David Woods did not mean to do either, that
    is, he did not mean either to kill Donna Pritlove, or he did not mean to
    cause Donna Pritlove bodily harm that David Woods knew was likely to kill
    Donna Pritlove, and was reckless whether Donna Pritlove died or not, David
    Woods committed manslaughter.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    stating the positions of the parties near the end of his charge, the trial
    judge told the jury that it was “the position of the Crown that Mr. Woods
    intentionally caused the death of Donna Pritlove and is therefore guilty
    of second degree murder”, that “[t]he real issue is whether this homicide
    was intentional or not” and that the “only logical and overpowering inference,
    according to the Crown, to be drawn is that Mr. Woods intended to kill Donna
    Pritlove when he pulled the trigger.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    light of the trial judge’s instructions, the jury must be taken to have known
    the required intention for a conviction of murder.  To arrive at the verdict
    of murder, the jury would have had to conclude that the appellant intended
    to kill his wife.  The jury clearly rejected the appellant’s evidence that
    that he did not know the gun was loaded, that he did not intend to kill his
    wife and that her death was accidental.  Since it is apparent from the verdict
    that the jury concluded the appellant intentionally killed his wife, a verdict
    of manslaughter was not open to them.  In those circumstances, I would not
    give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would accordingly dismiss the appeal.  </p>
