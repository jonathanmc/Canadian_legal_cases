    and Kelliher were convicted of offences relating to the theft of a large
    quantity of firearms from a house in Port Hope and their subsequent sale
    in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    St. Catharines.  The burglary occurred at the home of Kelliher’s mother and
    step-father.  Their convictions rested, in part, on the testimony of Cameron
    MacLean, an individual of unsavoury character.  MacLean had been arrested
    in respect of the offences after being found with some of the stolen guns
    in his possession.  </p>

    was disbelieved.  Kelliher did not testify or offer evidence.  </p>

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>1.         The trial judge’s
      application of <i>W. (D.)</i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    concluding that part of his reasons in which he found Crothers’ guilty, the
    trial judge stated, “I do not believe the evidence of the appellant [Crothers]
    and therefore find him guilty.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for Crothers submits that this statement reflects two errors.  First, he
    says that the statement shows that the trial judge never considered whether
    Crothers’
    testimony raised a reasonable doubt or whether he was satisfied of Crothers’
    guilt beyond a reasonable doubt based on the evidence as a whole.  In other
    words, he submits the trial judge never considered the last two steps in
    the <i>W. (D.)</i> analysis.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    he submits that use of the word “therefore” in the impugned statement shows
    that the trial judge used his disbelief of Crothers’ testimony as positive
    evidence of his guilt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    reject these arguments.  It is unfortunate that the trial judge used language
    which suggests that he moved directly from disbelieving Crothers to a finding
    of guilt.  However, despite the manner in which the trial judge expressed
    himself in that one instance, it is apparent from his reasons read as a whole
    that the trial judge understood and applied <i>W.(D.)</i> appropriately in
    ultimately concluding, on the whole of the evidence, that Crothers was guilty.  Before
    making the impugned statement, the trial judge correctly instructed himself
    on the burden of proof with specific reference to the three-step process
    in <i>W. (D.)</i>.  He explained why he rejected Crothers’ evidence and it
    is apparent from the language used that it raised no reasonable doubt in
    his mind.  He explained why he accepted MacLean’s evidence.  In short, although
    he did not use the “magic incantation” of the language of <i>W.(D.)</i> after
    setting out its principles, it is apparent from reading his reasons as whole
    that he applied those principles.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>2. The trial judge’s treatment
      of Crothers’ “alibi”</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crothers
    testified that he did not commit the offences and had never been to Port
    Hope but, because of the passage of time, he could not remember where he
    was at the relevant time.  Counsel for Crothers contends that the trial judge
    rejected Crothers’
    evidence partly because he drew an adverse inference based on his belief
    that Crothers had offered, at trial, an alibi for his whereabouts at the
    time the offences were committed and he had not disclosed the “alibi” to
    the prosecution before trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    the course of the trial, the trial judge did query whether Crothers was relying
    on an alibi.  However, it is clear from his reasons that his disbelief in
    Crothers’
    testimony was based on Crothers’ lack of credibility generally and not on
    any concern he may have had about non-disclosure of his whereabouts on the
    day in question.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>3. The trial judge’s treatment
      of MacLean’s evidence</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for Crothers relied on his written submissions in relation to this ground
    of appeal.  Based on his factum, his argument is that the trial judge exercised
    insufficient caution in accepting MacLean’s evidence, particularly as he
    failed to advert to MacLean’s admission of perjury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not accept this argument.  The trial judge properly cautioned himself
    before accepting MacLean’s testimony.  He listed a number of inconsistencies
    in MacLean’s testimony and demonstrated that he was fully aware of the issues
    affecting MacLean’s credibility and reliability.  He treated MacLean’s evidence
    with appropriate caution.  Furthermore, as the trial judge noted, there was
    ample other evidence which supported the substance of MacLean’s testimony.  This
    evidence included testimony from other witnesses that established Kelliher’s
    familiarity with the premises broken into and his knowledge of the existence
    of a significant collection of firearms there.  In addition there were Crothers’
    inculpatory statements, the general pattern of phone calls established by
    the cell phone experts and the ill-will that existed between Kelliher and
    his step-father.  Further, only weapons were taken in the burglary.  The
    weapons that were stolen were the ones of which Kelliher had knowledge of
    their location; the only weapons that were not taken were those that had
    been moved without Kelliher’s knowledge.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>II.  The Kelliher Appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for Kelliher made a preliminary argument based on joint culpability.  In
    light of our disposition of the Crothers’ appeal, it is unnecessary to deal
    with this issue.  He raised two additional issues. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    he argues that after the trial judge accepted MacLean’s evidence he jumped
    immediately to the conclusion that the case had been proven.  We do not accept
    this argument.  It is clear that the trial judge did not see the evidence
    of MacLean and Crothers as some type of contest in which choosing one necessitated
    rejection of the other.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Next,
    counsel for Kelliher submits that the trial judge failed to given adequate
    reasons because he did not deal with all of the inconsistencies in MacLean’s
    evidence.  For the reasons already given in relation to the MacLean evidence,
    we reject this submission.  The trial judge dealt with the substance of the
    critical issue, namely MacLean’s credibility and the reliability of his evidence,
    in accordance with the dictates of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v.
    R.E.M.</i>, 2008 SCC 51, at paras. 56 and following.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the appeals are dismissed.</p>
