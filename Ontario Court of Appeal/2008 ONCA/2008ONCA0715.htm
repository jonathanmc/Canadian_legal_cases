    appellant was convicted by a jury of second-degree murder as a result of
    the death of Rahim Prebtani.  Mr. Prebtani was repeatedly struck in the head
    by a baseball bat and died from blunt force injury to his brain.  This senseless
    attack took place early in the morning on
    <st1:date Year="2002" Day="20" Month="10" w:st="on">
    October 20, 2002, outside the Riverboat Inn in
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    Sivasubramaniam, Kenny Baggan, (the “
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto group”) and three women made the trip to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">
    Wasaga
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Beach for a weekend getaway.   At some point in the evening of October 19,
    2002, the group arrived at a bar at the Riverboat Inn, a complex of three
    businesses that also included a motel and a restaurant.  The appellant was
    at the bar with two of his friends, James Smith and Smith’s girlfriend, Chassidy
    Kidd (the “Smith group”). The evening was a volatile one for Smith and Kidd
    who argued off and on throughout the evening. However, the two groups engaged
    in friendly conversation.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Smith group left the bar.  The
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto men followed and came upon what they believed to be the aftermath
    of a dispute between Smith and Kidd that had left Kidd on the ground clutching
    her stomach.  The
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto men assumed Smith had assaulted his girlfriend and they confronted
    him.   This led to an altercation between the two groups at the end of which
    Prebtani lay in a ditch, dying from multiple blows to his head.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The jury found
    the appellant guilty of second-degree murder.  The judge imposed the mandatory
    sentence of imprisonment for life and fixed the parole ineligibility period
    at thirteen years.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant
    appeals from his conviction.  He raises a number of grounds, all relating
    to the trial judge’s final instructions to the jury.  The appellant claims
    that the trial judge erred by:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>wrongly

    a flawed <i>Vetrovec</i> caution that (i) failed to include an important
    Crown witness, and; (ii) used examples of confirmatory evidence that could
    not corroborate the witnesses subject to the warning;  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>finding
    that there was no air of reality to the defence that the appellant was deprived
    of the intent to kill by reason of his intoxication, and by failing, in his
    charge, to relate the relevant evidence to the issue of intent; and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(d)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>failing

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The primary issue
    at trial was identification.  Among those involved in the melee that night,
    who killed Prebtani?  The Crown called six witnesses who gave evidence as
    to their observations about the events that lead to Prebtani’s death.  Two
    contradictory narratives emerged. One identified Smith as the killer; the
    other identified the appellant.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><i>The version of events advanced by the Crown</i></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown’s case largely depended on the evidence of four witnesses in the Smith
    group – Kidd, Mike Verschaeve, a friend of Smith’s who lived at the Riverboat
    Inn at the time, Verschaeve’s son Drew, and Smith himself.  These witnesses
    claimed that the three men from
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto were the aggressors in the fight and that they jointly attacked Smith,
    knocking him to the ground and kicking him while he lay prone. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> According to
    Smith, he became engaged in a three-on-one fight with the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto group in which the men armed themselves with a broken beer bottle
    and a pylon. Smith’s evidence was that during the altercation he got on top
    of Sivasubramaniam while the other two men in the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto group kicked and stomped on him. At this point Smith warned Sivasubramaniam
    that he would “bite [his] fuckin’ eye out” if Sivasubramaniam did not call
    his friends off.  Smith then proceeded to bite Sivasubramaniam’s eye, causing
    it to bleed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Kidd
    was present when the fight began. Kidd said she screamed to the appellant
    for help when Smith was being assaulted, then ran into the Riverboat and
    asked the bartender, Christine Cabral, to call 911.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    some point Mike Verschaeve brought a baseball bat to the scene.  His evidence
    was that Drew woke him and told him that Smith was being attacked by three
    men.  He testified that his son suggested they intervene and take a baseball
    bat with them.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Verschaeve

    the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Toronto men to stop their attack on Smith.  His evidence, supported by Smith,
    was that the appellant then took the bat from him and pursued the
    <st1:place

    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto men. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Drew
    testified that he looked out the window after his father left with the bat
    and saw the appellant and Smith chasing the three
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto men.   Drew said the appellant was carrying the bat as he ran.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Verschaeve

style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>According
    to Verschaeve he saw Smith catch up to Prebtani, who had fallen in a ditch
    at the side of the road.  Smith kicked him.  The appellant then arrived and,
    with the baseball bat, delivered six to eight blows to the victim’s head.  Verschaeve
    claimed to have screamed at the appellant to stop.  The appellant paused
    and then stuck Prebtani again.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Smith
    testified that when he found Prebtani lying in the ditch, he stepped on his
    head.  At that instant he felt a blow to his ankle and saw the appellant
    standing next to him with the bat.  He tried to convince the appellant to
    stop but he continued to strike Prebtani.  According to Smith, he eventually
    managed to pull the appellant away.  </p>

    by a bush.  He said his father was behind the bush with Smith and the appellant.  He
    heard some “stomping”
    noises and Smith say “Mike stop” and his father say “stop”.  </p>

    appellant, who did not testify on his own behalf, relied primarily on the
    evidence of Sivasubramaniam, supported to some extent by Baggan, to the effect
    that Smith was the one who killed Prebtani. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Both
    Sivasubramaniam and Baggan testified that they left the bar with Prebtani
    and saw Smith standing over Kidd, who was lying on the ground.  The three
    men confronted Smith and an argument ensued. At some point Baggan left the
    group to return to the cottage where the
    <st1:place w:st="on">

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Sivasubramaniam’s
    evidence was that during the argument, Smith, the aggressor, head butted
    him.  The two men began to fight and fell to the ground.  Smith grabbed Sivasubramaniam’s
    head and bit him in the left eye, causing severe injury.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When
    Sivasubramaniam stood up, he saw that Mike Verschaeve had a baseball bat
    in his hands. According to Sivasubramaniam and contrary to the version of
    events advanced by the Crown, Smith was the man who grabbed the bat from
    Verschaeve and began to chase him. Sivasubramaniam yelled out for his friends
    to run when he saw Smith take the bat. He then turned and began to run toward
    the cottage. </p>

    Baggan on the way to the cottage.   They went to the cottage, armed themselves
    with a knife, and returned to the scene with two other friends only to discover
    Prebtani by the side of the road, critically injured.  They put him in their
    car and as they drove for help they passed Smith, Kidd and the appellant

    to Kidd portions of her statement to the police and her preliminary inquiry

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:

    that the jury should accept the contents of what Kidd said in her statement:  <s> </s></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>… You saw some of that evidence when the videotape

    her demeanour and how she was openly responsive on the video.  How she appeared
    to reach in the video into her memory and answer the question.  I suggest
    that when you consider her demeanour on the video and the circumstances in
    which it was made, you can conclude as she testified here, that she was telling
    the truth then.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I further suggest that portions of her video statement <i>she

    a condition of admissibility the trial judge must be satisfied that there
    is an evidentiary basis on which the trier of fact <i>could</i> conclude

    did acknowledge having made the statement and did say that she was likely

    vouch for the accuracy of the statement based on circumstances surrounding

    trial judge committed two errors by directing the jury that Kidd had adopted
    her statement. First, there was no evidentiary basis for that conclusion.
    Adoption was simply not possible in these circumstances.  Second, even if
    there was an evidentiary basis, it was a matter for the jury to decide whether
    or not Kidd adopted what she said in her interview with the police as part
    of her trial testimony and imprinted it with her trial oath.  The trial judge

    First, what Kidd said was tantamount to adoption. Second, the statements
    could have been admitted under the hearsay exception for past recollections

    eliminated the need for an adult witness to have some recollection of the
    events contained in the statement.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    issue in <i>C.C.F.</i> were the requirements for the admissibility of a videotaped
    statement under s. 715.1 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46,
    a statutory exception to the hearsay rule that permits an out-of-court statement
    to be admitted at the trials of certain enumerated offences if the complainant
    is a child under the age of eighteen and if the video was made within a reasonable
    time following the alleged offences.  The court held that the word “adopts” in
    s. 715.1 should be given a meaning that advances the dual purposes of the
    section; to create a record of what is likely to be the witness’ best recollection
    of the events and to reduce the harm to a child of further participation
    in court proceedings. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To
    this end the legislators incorporated several factors into the section to
    provide the requisite reliability that traditionally comes from the witness’ adopting
    the statement under oath. First, the statement must be made at a time reasonably
    proximate to the events in issue.  Second, the statement must describe the
    acts complained of. Third, the child must be given the opportunity to attest
    to the fact that he or she was trying to tell the truth when the statement
    was recorded. As made clear in <i>C.C.F.,</i> the fact that a child does
    not have a present memory of the events described is not a barrier to the
    admission of the statement. In such circumstances, the trier of fact must
    have an opportunity to watch the entire videotaped statement – providing
    an opportunity to judge the child’s demeanour.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    decision in <i>C.C.F.</i>  does not affect the law as it applies to the adoption
    of out-of-court statements of adults.  Quite the opposite.  It reinforces
    the importance of adopting a statement under oath. Cory J. for the court
    makes it very clear that the traditional tests for adoption still apply outside
    the s. 715.1 context – the guarantees of reliability built into s. 715.1
    make the strict adoption test unnecessary <i>in relation to the evidence
    of children</i>: see <i>C.C.F</i> at para. 40.</p>

    past recollections must be recorded in a reliable way. This requirement can
    be broken down into two separate considerations: First, it requires the witness
    to have prepared the record personally, or to have reviewed it for accuracy
    if someone else prepared it. Second, the original record must be used it
    if is available. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:

    accuracy: The witness, although having no memory of the recorded events,
    must vouch for the accuracy of the assertions in the record; in other words,
    the witness must be able to say that he or she was being truthful at the
    time the assertions were recorded.           </p>

    <i>Richardson</i>, the past recollection recorded was properly admitted because
    it was “apparent that the trial judge accepted [the witness’] memory loss
    as genuine”: at para. 29.  The problem the Crown faces is that here the trial
    judge believed that Kidd was being untruthful about her memory lapses. In
    his instructions to the jury, he expressed his view that Kidd was
    “obviously lying when she said she could not recall events that would be
    etched in anyone’s memory for life”.</p>

    the Crown, relying on the well-known case of <i>R. v B. (K.G.) </i>(1993)<i>,</i> 79
    C.C.C. (3d) 257, submits that these portions of Kidd’s videotaped statement
    to the police were substantively admissible under the principled hearsay
    exception. <i>K.G.B. </i>establishes that evidence of a witness’ prior inconsistent
    statement may be substantively admissible where the criteria of necessity
    and reliability are satisfied.  </p>

    been established given the difficulties associated with Kidd’s memory. However,
    problems present themselves in terms of the reliability requirement in light
    of the evidence of Kidd’s intoxication, her admitted unreliability as an
    observer, her powerful motive to lie to protect her boyfriend and her admission
    that she lied when she made her first statement to the police </p>

    the problems the Crown would have had trying to get this evidence properly

    error caused significant prejudice to the appellant.  The jury had before
    it untested evidence that was potentially powerful for the prosecution. Kidd’s
    prior videotaped statement to the police put the bat into the appellant’s
    hands.  This is significant for two reasons.  First, the central issue was

    including crimes of dishonesty and was on probation for fraud at the time

    during the trial.  The trial judge ruled that he would give a
    “forceful warning” in relation to the testimony of Smith, Verschaeve, Drew
    and Kidd.  He made no mention of Christine Cabral in his ruling.  I do not,
    therefore, have the benefit of the trial judge’s reasons as to why he decided

    refusing to give the <i>Vetrovec</i> warning in relation to Cabral’s evidence.  He
    submits that Cabral’s criminal record was minimal.  And the lie she admitted
    to having told during the course of her trial testimony, about a matter not
    germane to the events in issue, was nothing more than an effort to cover
    something up that was particularly embarrassing.  It was “hopeless and impulsive” and
    was immediately admitted when exposed. </p>

      to be considered in determining whether a <i>Vetrovec </i>warning is necessary:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In summary, two main factors are relevant when deciding
    whether a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning is necessary: the witness’s credibility,
    and the importance of the witness’s testimony to the Crown’s case.  No specific
    threshold need be met on either factor before a warning becomes necessary.  Instead,
    where the witness is absolutely essential to the Crown’s case, more moderate
    credibility problems will warrant a warning.  Where the witness has overwhelming
    credibility problems, a warning may be necessary even if the Crown’s case
    is a strong one without the witness’s evidence.  In short, the factors should
    not be looked to independently of one another but in combination.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Applying
    the factors set out in <i>Brooks</i>, the trial judge should have provided
    the jury with a <i>Vetrovec </i>warning in relation to Cabral’s evidence.  Her
    evidence suffered from serious credibility problems and was important to
    the prosecution’s case.</p>

    admitted to lying under oath during her testimony. Her fraud conviction was
    in relation to the theft of a Visa card.  During cross-examination Cabral
    was asked whose Visa card she stole.  She replied that she did not know.
    Later she conceded that she had lied to the court and that the stolen card
    belonged to her grandfather.  I disagree with the Crown’s submissions the
    consequences of this lie should be discounted.  Cabral told a direct lie
    to the jury in a situation where a man’s liberty was at stake.  In such circumstances,
    lying under oath must always be taken seriously.</p>

    do not accept the Crown’s submission that the standard portions of the trial
    judge’s instructions were sufficient to alert the jury to the need to approach
    Cabral’s evidence with the requisite degree of caution.  The charge was relatively
    brief and in the portions concerning the use the jury could make of criminal
    convictions and inconsistencies in a witness’ testimony, the trial judge
    did not advert to Cabral or her evidence.  While it is not incumbent upon
    a trial judge to detail all of the inconsistencies arising from a witness’s
    testimony, I am of the view that in so far as Cabral is concerned, there
    were ample reasons to put the jury on notice about Cabral’s credibility problems.</p>

    for the importance of Cabral’s evidence to the Crown’s case, while she was
    not involved in the altercation itself, her evidence was potentially powerful
    for two reasons.  First, she was one of the only witnesses not closely associated
    with either the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto or the Smith group.  Second, as submitted by the Crown during closing
    argument, she was an “important witness because she confirmed the extended
    confrontation before the murder.  She describes [the appellant] as leaving
    the scene with the murder weapon.” </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    made clear in <i>Brooks</i>, the decision to give a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning
    falls within the broad discretion of the trial judge. “Provided there is
    a foundation for the trial judge’s exercise of discretion, appellate courts
    should not interfere” with the trial judge’s decision: <i>Brooks</i> at para.
    4. After considering the factors identified in <i>Brooks</i> and without
    the benefit of the trial judge’s reasons for deciding not to include Cabral,

    having regard to the particular circumstances of this case, namely that this “important” witness
    stood alone as a beacon - the only Crown eye witness who was not the subject
    of the <i>Vetrovec </i>caution – coupled with the fact that Cabral had little
    regard for telling the truth, the jury should have been given a sharp warning
    about the inherent dangers of Cabral’s evidence and the risk of accepting
    it without supporting evidence.    </p>

    the question of whether the appellant was guilty of manslaughter or second-degree
    murder was a live issue.   It was necessary for the trial judge to have appropriately
    instructed the jury in this respect.  </p>

    his closing argument the Crown impugned Sivasubramaniam’s honesty when he
    suggested to the jury that Sivasubramaniam lied as a result of his guilt
    over his involvement in the altercation. This is how he expressed it:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>… What motive might Kirupa [Sivasubramaniam] and
    Kenny [Baggan] have to lie?  I’m suggesting to you, members of the jury,
    that they knew much more than they were telling.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:
center'>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I’m suggesting to you that Kirupa knew it was a
    battle.  He knew Rahim was involved.  He knew that the bat created a whole
    new danger for him and his friends and he knew that when their friend – their
    best friend I believe he described him – was in trouble, they didn’t help.  They
    just ran.  They fled and their friend paid the price for a conflict that
    essentially Kirupa started.  How do you explain that?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:
center'>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I suggest that they didn’t explain it to people.  That
    they couldn’t.  That it was easier to come up with this minimal story that
    says that it was a simple fight, “I saw the bat and I ran and there was nothing
    else”.  They may very well have convinced themselves by this point that it’s
    true, but I suggest to you members of the jury, that when you look at all
    of the evidence and you see that milieu in front of the River Boat (<i>sic</i>),
    it’s clear that these boys know more than they’re saying.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    problem is that at no time while Sivasubramaniam was testifying did the Crown
    suggest to the witness that he had a motive to lie or that he was being untruthful.  Thus
    the defence did not ask Sivasubramaniam questions about his honesty.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    rule in <i>Browne v. Dunn</i> (1893), 6 R.67, establishes that if counsel
    seeks to challenge the credibility of a witness by calling contradictory
    evidence, the witness must be given the opportunity to address such evidence
    during cross-examination. The nature of the contradictory evidence must at
    least be put to the witness during cross-examination by the counsel who plans
    to lead it. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Here,
    Crown counsel did not seek to call evidence to contradict what Sivasubramaniam
    said.  Rather, long after he left the courtroom, the Crown presented argument
    as to why his credibility was suspect. The effect, however, is the same.
    Neither the defence nor the witness himself was unable to address allegations
    of dishonesty in respect to a key witness, in any meaningful way.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    defence counsel pointed out to the jury that the Crown did not cross-examine
    Sivasubramaniam on any alleged credibility issues – effectively saying that
    Sivasubramaniam had been unfairly treated in this respect, this was insufficient
    to correct the problem.  Instructions from the trial judge were necessary. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    coming to this conclusion, I rely on this court’s decision in <i>R. v. McNeill</i> (2000)
    144 C.C.C. (3d) 511, in which Moldaver J. offered two suggestions for counsel
    aggrieved by a breach of the rule in <i>Browne v. Dunn</i>. First, the witness
    whose evidence is at issue may be recalled. Where recall is impossible, or
    highly impracticable, as a second option, a special instruction should be
    given to the jury, in terms of assessing the weight to be given to the evidence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the present circumstances, the only way of effectively correcting the unfairness
    the Crown created was for the trial judge to tell the jury that in assessing
    the weight to give to Sivasubramaniam’s evidence, they may properly take
    into account the fact that he was not given the opportunity to respond to
    the Crown’s accusations of dishonesty. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[112]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Sivasubramaniam’s
    credibility was central to the appellant’s position.  Crown counsel’s treatment
    of his evidence was therefore highly prejudicial to the defence.  The Crown’s
    decision not to put Sivasubramaniam’s honesty in issue during the trial may
    well have influenced Sivasubramaniam’s testimony as well as decisions the
    defence made to advance the case on behalf of the appellant.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[113]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The

    for the appellant failed to object at various key points during the trial.
    There was no objection raised to the trial judge’s instruction mid-trial
    as to the use to be made of Kidd’s videotaped statement. Nor did counsel
    object to the trial judge’s failure to include Cabral in the <i>Vetrovec</i> warning.  Again,
    counsel did not object when the trial judge instructed the jury that Kidd
    had adopted her prior statement. Finally, counsel did not object to the instruction
    with respect to the effect of intoxication on the requisite intent for murder.<b><u></u></b></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

    failure to object can inform the court’s assessment of the adequacy of the
    trial judge’s instruction, especially where the appellant relies on a non-direction
    as a ground of appeal.  However, I am satisfied that the errors I have identified
    affected the appellant’s right to a fair trial and counsel’s failure to object
    is no answer to the errors I have identified.</p>
