  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent was charged with sexual assault.  From the outset, he has acknowledged
    that he engaged in non-consensual sexual relations with the victim.  He claimed
    that he was asleep when the sexual activity occurred, was unaware of what
    was happening, and unable to control his actions.  The respondent advanced
    only one defence – non-mental disorder automatism.  The Crown took the position
    that the respondent had not established that his actions were involuntary
    and was guilty of sexual assault.  Alternatively, the Crown argued that if
    the respondent’s actions were involuntary, those actions were the product
    of a mental disorder and the respondent should be found not criminally responsible
    on account of mental disorder (NCR-MD).    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge had to decide two questions:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Were
    the respondent’s actions involuntary?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If
    the respondent’s actions were involuntary, were they the product of a mental
    disorder, thereby rendering him NCR-MD?</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    first question goes to the respondent’s culpability.  If the respondent’s
    actions were involuntary, he could not be convicted.  The second question
    addresses the proper disposition to be made if the respondent’s actions were
    involuntary.  If his involuntary actions were the product of a mental disorder,
    a finding of NCR-MD was the appropriate verdict.  However, if the actions,
    while involuntary, were not the product of a mental disorder, an acquittal <i>simpliciter</i> was
    the appropriate result.  Persons found NCR-MD are subject to the provisions
    of Part XX.I of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.O. 1985, c. C-46.  Orders made
    pursuant to those provisions can impose significant long-term restrictions
    on an individual’s liberty.  Persons who are acquitted <i>simpliciter</i> are
    not subject to any further proceedings or restrictions.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge, relying mainly on the uncontradicted evidence of the defence
    expert, held that the respondent’s actions were involuntary and that they
    were not the product of a mental disorder.  He acquitted the respondent.  The
    Crown appeals. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown advanced three arguments on appeal.  The first two, if successful,
    undermine the trial judge’s finding that the appellant’s actions were involuntary
    and would necessitate a new trial on the charge of sexual assault.  The third
    ground of appeal challenges the trial judge’s conclusion that the respondent’s
    actions were not the product of a mental disorder.  Crown counsel focused
    her able oral submissions on this ground of appeal.  If successful, this
    ground leaves untouched the trial judge’s finding that the respondent’s actions
    were involuntary but puts in issue the verdict which should flow from that
    finding</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    would allow the appeal.  I find no merit in the first two arguments.  However,
    I would give effect to the third argument.  The respondent personifies one
    of the most difficult problems encountered in the criminal law.  As a result
    of his parasomnia, he did a terrible thing, he sexually assaulted a defenceless,
    young victim.  The reason for his conduct – automatism brought on by parasomnia – renders
    his actions non-culpable in the eyes of the criminal law.  That very same
    explanation, however, makes his behaviour potentially dangerous and raises
    legitimate public safety concerns.  An outright acquittal reflects the non-culpable
    nature of the conduct but does nothing to address the potential danger posed
    by the respondent’s condition.  The Canadian criminal law responds to the
    public safety concerns by treating almost all automatisms as the product
    of a mental disorder leading not to an acquittal but to an NCR-MD verdict.  That
    verdict acknowledges that the accused committed the prohibited act but is
    not criminally culpable.  An NCR-MD verdict also permits an individualized
    post-verdict dangerousness assessment of the accused leading to a disposition
    tailored to the specifics of the individual case.  On a proper application
    of the principles developed in the Canadian case law, the respondent’s automatism
    is properly characterized as a mental disorder and should have led to an
    NCR-MD verdict.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    would stress, however, that an NCR-MD verdict is not a medical diagnosis
    of the respondent.  No one suggests that he is mentally ill.  The criminal
    law uses the concept of mental disorder very differently than the medical
    profession.  The concept of a mental disorder in the criminal law is used
    to describe those accused who have committed criminal acts but because of
    some abnormal mental state are unable to conform their behaviour to the dictates
    of the criminal law.  A determination that an accused suffers from a mental
    disorder is more a reflection of the need for a further inquiry into the
    dangerousness of that accused than it is an assessment of his or her medical
    condition.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>II.        THE FIRST TWO GROUNDS
      OF APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    will briefly address these grounds before turning to a more detailed consideration
    of the third ground of appeal.  The Crown’s first argument alleges that the
    trial judge misused part of the evidence of Dr. Colin Shapiro, the expert
    called by the defence.  Dr. Shapiro referred to statements made to him by
    a former girlfriend of the respondent.  Dr. Shapiro used the information
    she provided, along with a great deal of other material, in assessing the
    reliability of information provided by the respondent, and in ultimately
    forming his medical opinion.  In her factum, Crown counsel argued that the
    trial judge misused the information provided by the third party and treated
    it as evidence that the events described by the girlfriend had in fact occurred.  The
    Crown did not make oral submissions in support of this ground of appeal.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    expert was entitled to use the comments made to him by the respondent’s former
    girlfriend in assessing the reliability of the information provided to him
    by the respondent and in ultimately formulating his opinion: <i>R. v. Lavallee</i> (1990),
    55 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (S.C.C.), at p. 127.  Nothing in the trial judge’s reasons
    suggests that the trial judge misused any of the evidence given by the expert. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    second ground of appeal arises out of an unusual step taken by the trial
    judge at the end of the respondent’s cross-examination.  Given the nature
    of the respondent’s defence and his obvious remorse from the moment he was
    confronted by the complainant, the trial judge invited the respondent to
    apologize to the complainant who was in the courtroom.  The respondent apologized.  The
    trial judge referred to this apology in his reasons for judgment when describing
    the respondent as remorseful.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Whatever
    may be said about the wisdom of suggesting that the respondent apologize
    while testifying, nothing said by the trial judge foreclosed the Crown from
    seeking permission to further cross-examine the respondent after he had made
    his apology.  The Crown did not ask to reopen her cross-examination.  I cannot
    think of any questions arising out of the apology that the Crown could usefully
    have asked.  The trial judge’s reference to the respondent’s remorse as evidenced
    by his apology played no role in his analysis of the material issues.  As
    counsel for the respondent put it in their factum, the apology and the trial
    judge’s reference to it had nothing to do with the outcome of this case.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>III.       THE MAIN GROUND
      OF APPEAL: SHOULD THE RESPONDENT HAVE BEEN ACQUITTED OR FOUND NCR-MD?</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    advancing the third ground of appeal, Crown counsel accepts that the respondent
    was in an automatistic state when he attacked the victim and that his actions
    were involuntary.  Crown counsel also accepts the trial judge’s factual findings.  She
    submits, however, that the trial judge erred in law in characterizing the
    respondent’s condition as non-mental disorder automatism and not mental disorder
    automatism.  The latter characterization would result in a finding under
    s. 16 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> of NCR-MD.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge found that the respondent’s actions were involuntary and that
    he had no control over those actions.  There was ample evidence to support
    that finding.  Persons who act involuntarily in that they cannot control
    their actions are innocent of any criminal wrongdoing.  The respondent deserves
    neither punishment nor stigmatization as a criminal for his actions.  The
    question raised by this ground of appeal
    – whether the respondent should be found not guilty or not criminally responsible
    on account of mental disorder – is an important question both for the respondent
    and the community at large.  However, on either verdict the respondent is
    innocent of any criminal conduct.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    emphasizing the respondent’s innocence, I do not intend to diminish the very
    real harm suffered by the victim.  The involuntary nature of the respondent’s
    conduct does not lessen the trauma the victim suffered, or the psychological
    burden she carries as a result of the attack.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Nor,
    in my view, does the involuntary nature of the respondent’s actions lessen
    the interest of the community, as represented by the prosecution in criminal
    matters, in determining whether the respondent poses a danger.  The legitimate
    interest of the criminal law can go beyond the primary concern of guilt or
    innocence.  </p>
  <h3>A.        THE SEXUAL ASSAULT</h3>

    and some friends went to a croquet tournament and house party at a home in
    the Beaches district of Toronto on July 5, 2003.  They arrived in the early
    evening.  At about 2:00 a.m. on July 6<sup>th</sup>, L.O. went into the large
    living room of the house and sat on an L-shaped couch.  She was tired and
    ready to go home but did not want to make her friends leave before they were
    ready.  L.O. curled up on the couch and fell asleep. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:

    respondent arrived at the party at about 9:00 p.m.  He knew one of the hosts,
    had attended the party the previous year, and was the reigning croquet champion.  At
    about 4:00 a.m., the respondent, who had consumed a great deal of alcohol,
    decided to “crash” in the living room.  He had done this before.  The respondent
    noticed a young woman (L.O.) sleeping on the couch.  He did not know her.  There
    were several other people in the living room.  The respondent sat down on
    the end of the couch away from where L.O. was sleeping.  He fell asleep.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:

    awoke, at what she estimated to be about 5:00 a.m.  The respondent was on
    top of her with his penis in her vagina.  L.O.’s underwear had been removed
    and her skirt had been pushed up.  She had no idea who the respondent was
    or why he was attacking her.  She screamed and pushed the respondent away
    from her.  According to her, the respondent got up onto his knees and looked
    dazed.  In her statement to the police given later that day, she described
    him this way:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>He looked completely incoherent.  Like not even
    when someone’s drunk.  <u>More like just when you’ve just woken them up out
    of a sound sleep.</u>  [Emphasis added.]</p>

    left the house quickly only to realize that she had left her keys in the
    living room.  L.O. returned and confronted the respondent.  She demanded
    to know his name.  He replied, “Jan”.  L.O. left the house a second time.  She
    went to the hospital and then to the police.</p>

    respondent was thirty-two years old, owned his own landscaping business and
    by all accounts was a well-liked, hardworking, young man.  He worked particularly
    long hours in the summer months.  On July 4<sup>th</sup>, the day before
    the party, the respondent spent a long day working and then drove north to
    a friend’s cottage on
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Georgian Bay, some two hours away.  He had a few drinks with his friends
    on the evening of July 4<sup>th</sup> and woke up early on the 5<sup>th</sup> to
    go for a swim.  The respondent spent the day at the cottage swimming and
    doing other cottage related activities.  He drove back to

    the respondent sat down on the couch in the living room at about 4:00 a.m.
    on July 6<sup>th</sup>, he was under the influence of alcohol and had not
    slept for over 20 hours.  He fell asleep very quickly.  The respondent awoke
    to find himself on top of L.O.  She was pushing him away and screaming at
    him.  The respondent was very confused and did not know what was happening.  He
    recalled that L.O. demanded to know his name and that he told her his first
    name.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:

    respondent left the house shortly after L.O.  He hoped to see her outside
    so that he could talk to her about what had happened.  She was gone.  He
    went to his parents’ home nearby and went to bed.  He woke up later that
    morning to go to the bathroom and discovered he was wearing a condom.  This
    made him even more confused about the events of the previous night. </p>

    that morning, the respondent spoke to his friend who had hosted the party.  His
    friend told him that the police were at his home investigating a sexual assault
    and had taken someone into custody.  The respondent asked to speak to one
    of the police officers.  He told the officer, “I think I am the perpetrator” and
    arranged to go to the police station.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:

    the police station, the respondent declined the invitation to contact counsel
    before speaking to the police.  He provided a voluntary videotaped statement.  In
    that statement, the respondent told the police he was very drunk when he
    fell asleep on the couch.  He had only a partial memory of the relevant events.  At
    the time of the interview, it is clear that the respondent believed that
    he had engaged in non-consensual sexual activity with L.O. because he was
    very drunk.  The respondent clearly felt responsible for what had happened
    to L.O.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:

    respondent was charged and released on bail.  In the ensuing months, he became
    depressed thinking about the events.  He was not a sexually aggressive person
    and did not regard himself as someone who would take advantage of a person
    who was in the position of L.O. and deliberately inflict the trauma that
    L.O. must have suffered.  The respondent eventually sought psychiatric assistance
    in the hope that he could better understand what had happened that evening.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:

    to being charged, the respondent recalled prior occasions when he awoke to
    find himself having sex with a girlfriend with whom he was sleeping and with
    whom he had engaged in consensual sexual intercourse.  He did not know how
    the activity started.  Because these incidents occurred in the context of
    relationships that included consensual sexual activity, the respondent did
    not regard them as unusual and paid no attention to them.  The respondent
    also recalled a similar incident in March, 2004, about nine months after
    the charges were laid.  In total, he recalled four prior incidents involving
    three former girlfriends.  When the respondent told his psychiatrist about
    these events, the psychiatrist referred him to Dr. Shapiro, a sleep disorder
    specialist.  Dr. Shapiro was retained by the defence and testified at trial.  His
    evidence was central to the respondent’s defence and the trial judge’s decision.  </p>
  <h3>B.        DR. SHAPIRO’S EVIDENCE</h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr.
    Shapiro’s expertise in various matters, including sleep disorders, was not
    questioned at trial.  Nor did the Crown call any competing expert evidence.  The
    trial judge accepted Dr. Shapiro’s evidence and the opinions that he advanced.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr.
    Shapiro opined that the respondent was in a parasomniac state while engaging
    in sexual activity with L.O.  Parasomnia involves a sudden unexplained arousal
    from sleep.  Persons may carry out various physical activities while in a
    parasomniac state.  Usually those activities are not complex, and may include
    hand gestures, talking, or walking.  More rarely, an individual in a parasomniac
    state engages in complex physical activity that can include eating, sexual
    acts, or driving a vehicle.  Physical activities performed by a person in
    a parasomniac state are often bizarre but can appear purposive.  Parasomniacs
    are seldom violent.  Dr. Shapiro has coined the word “sexsomnia”
    to describe parasomnias during which an individual engages in some form of
    sexual activity.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr.
    Shapiro explained that a person who is experiencing a parasomniac episode
    acts without any volition, consciousness, or capacity to control his or her
    behaviour.  The individual may subsequently recall some or none of the events
    that occurred in the parasomniac state.  If the individual has partial recollection,
    he or she will sometimes attempt to fill in the memory gaps by including
    in the narrative things that he or she thinks must have happened.  Dr. Shapiro
    believed that the respondent engaged in this kind of confabulation during
    his interview with the police.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    explaining why a person cannot control his or her activities during a parasomniac
    episode, Dr. Shapiro said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>They’re a function of the fact that the person’s
    arousing out of a deep sleep.  And in deep sleep you don’t have judgment.  <u>And
    so if you suddenly get catapulted into wakefulness, you still have part of
    that deep sleep with you and so you just don’t know what you’re doing.</u>  [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr.
    Shapiro testified that about 15 per cent of children and 3 per cent of adults
    experience parasomnia.  Most episodes of parasomnia occur in the deep sleep
    phase of the sleep cycle.  As most deep sleep occurs shortly after a person
    falls asleep, episodes of parasomnia will most often occur shortly after
    a person falls asleep.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr.
    Shapiro testified that sleep experts generally agree that individuals can
    engage in various forms of complex, apparently goal-oriented behaviour, including
    sexual activity, while in a parasomniac state.  He further indicated that
    the consensus among sleep experts was that these individuals had no control
    over their actions.  Dr. Shapiro agreed that the incidence of sexsomnia is
    unknown and that there are relatively few reported cases in the medical and
    legal literature.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  He believed that these reported cases represented
    a very small fraction of the total number of sexsomnia events.  Dr. Shapiro
    reasoned that sexsomnia was most likely to involve the person with whom the
    parasomniac usually slept.  Persons who slept together were often involved
    in consensual sexual relationships.  In that context, sexsomnia would in
    all likelihood not be perceived as problematic and would not be brought to
    the attention of either a doctor or the criminal justice system.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr.
    Shapiro based his opinion that the respondent was in a parasomniac state
    during the sexual activity on information gathered from many sources.  Dr.
    Shapiro saw the respondent in his office twice and had him complete a detailed
    questionnaire.  He also interviewed the respondent’s mother and brother and
    had them observed in his sleep clinic.  Dr. Shapiro reviewed virtually all
    of the disclosure documentation and transcripts of the testimony relevant
    to the charge.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Most
    significantly, the respondent spent two nights in Dr. Shapiro’s sleep clinic.  On
    both evenings, his brain waves and other vital signs were monitored.  He
    was also videotaped while he was asleep.  Dr. Shapiro reviewed the graphs
    of the brain waves taken while the respondent was asleep. On both evenings,
    the brain wave activity showed that the respondent went abruptly from the
    deepest part of his sleep cycle to a wakened state.  In Dr. Shapiro’s opinion,
    these brain wave patterns were a “hallmark of parasomnia”.  Brain wave patterns
    cannot be manipulated by the subject of the test.  Dr. Shapiro believed that
    this neurological evidence demonstrated conclusively that the respondent
    was among the small group of adult persons who experience parasomnia.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    addition to the significant neurological indicator of parasomnia, Dr. Shapiro
    pointed to several factors that predisposed the respondent to parasomnia.  First,
    there was a family history of parasomnia.  Both his mother and brother experienced
    parasomniac episodes.  Parasomnia is known to be hereditary.  Second, the
    respondent experienced parasomniac events during his childhood.  Third, there
    were prior incidents of parasomnia that involved sexual activity.  The respondent
    had reported four incidents involving three girlfriends in the previous several
    years.  Dr. Shapiro spoke with one of those former girlfriends who confirmed
    the event described by the respondent.  That event occurred in March 2004,
    several months after the respondent was charged.  A second girlfriend testified
    in reply for the Crown.  She described two events in which she awoke to find
    the respondent lying on top of her engaging in sexual intercourse.  His eyes
    were closed and he later told her that he awoke to find himself having sex
    with her.  She thought nothing of the incidents at the time.  These incidents
    occurred several years before the attack on L.O.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr.
    Shapiro also identified several factors present on the morning of July 6<sup>th</sup> that
    were known to trigger parasomniac events in individuals predisposed to parasomnia.  These
    included sleep deprivation, the respondent had not slept for over 20 hours;
    extreme physical exhaustion, the respondent was working very hard; and alcohol
    consumption, the respondent had consumed a considerable amount of alcohol
    at the party.  These factors all tend to increase the deep sleep phase of
    the sleep cycle and thereby increase the chance of a parasomniac episode
    in a person who is predisposed to parasomnia.  In addition to these triggering
    factors, the respondent was under some emotional stress as a result of several
    recent deaths of parents of the respondent’s friends.  Stress, especially
    in combination with the other triggering factors, can precipitate parasomnia
    in individuals predisposed to that condition.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr.
    Shapiro also referred to what he described as contextual factors in support
    of his opinion.  He noted that the sexual activity occurred within an hour
    after the respondent fell asleep when he was most likely in the deep sleep
    phase of his sleep cycle.  Dr. Shapiro also placed some reliance on the respondent’s
    appearance and reaction as reported by L.O. when she found him on top of
    her on the couch.  Her description of the respondent in her statement to
    the police described a person in a parasomniac state.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:

    Shapiro testified that there was no “cure”
    for parasomnia.  Parasomnia declines as persons grow older because the deep
    sleep phase of the sleep cycle shortens.  Dr. Shapiro stressed that proper
    sleep habits can diminish the likelihood of a parasomniac event.  These include
    avoiding becoming overtired and limiting one’s alcohol consumption.  Dr.
    Shapiro also indicated that clonazepan, a drug known to reduce the length
    of the deep sleep phase of the sleep cycle, could be taken to reduce the
    likelihood of parasomnia occurring.  Dr. Shapiro prescribed clonazepan for
    the respondent.  </p>

    Shapiro testified that from a medical perspective, he did not regard parasomnia
    as a mental disease or disorder, or as the product of any mental disease
    or disorder.  He believed that the medical profession generally shared this
    opinion.  In the course of explaining why he did not regard parasomnia as
    a disease or disorder, he said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[I]n the sense that parasomnia is a normal – it
    arises out of a normal process.  So if fifteen percent of children walk or
    talk in their sleep, you wouldn’t say they all have a pathology.  <u>It is
    something that happens.  It comes out of a normal process which is sleep.</u>  And
    so in some ways it’s thought of differently than a disorder such as epilepsy,
    heart disease or sleep apnea.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

    Shapiro was asked about the likelihood of the respondent engaging in a further
    episode of sexsomnia involving non-consensual sexual activity.  He thought
    that the chance of recurrence was “very small”.  Dr. Shapiro testified that
    the event had occurred in a very unusual set of circumstances, and at a time
    when the respondent was unaware of his parasomnia and the possibility that
    he could engage in sexual activity during parasomnia.  Dr. Shapiro said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I’m sure he would make sure that he’s not in a circumstance
    to be falling asleep in a semi-public place with somebody else sleeping in
    close proximity who is not very familiar with him </p>

    cross-examination, Dr. Shapiro agreed that if the respondent did not take
    the medication prescribed and did not take steps to avoid factors that could
    precipitate parasomnia, the likelihood of a parasomniac event would increase.  Even
    then he noted that unusual circumstances would have to be present to result
    in a recurrence of the non-consensual sexual activity.  </p>

    of the trial, the respondent was not under the care of Dr. Shapiro or any
    other sleep specialist.  He was taking clonazepan as prescribed by Dr. Shapiro
    and planned to go back to see Dr. Shapiro when his prescription ran out.  Dr.
    Shapiro testified that if the respondent were to become his patient he would
    continue to prescribe clonazepan and would see the respondent on a regular
    basis.  Dr. Shapiro believed that the respondent would welcome ongoing treatment.<a href="#_ftn3"

  <h3>C.        THE TRIAL JUDGE’S REASONS</h3>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge gave careful reasons for judgment.  After a review of the evidence,
    he concluded that the respondent was in an automatistic state medically characterized
    as sexsomnia, a category of parasomnia.  He had established on the balance
    of probabilities that his actions were involuntary.  That finding stands
    for the purposes of this appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge then turned to the question of whether the respondent’s automatism
    was the product of mental disorder.  The trial judge had received extensive
    submissions from counsel (filed on appeal) and was alive to the relevant
    authorities, especially <i>R. v. Stone</i> (1999), 134 C.C.C. (3d) 353 (S.C.C.).  He
    recognized that he must start from the assumption that the respondent’s automatism
    was the product of a mental disorder and that it would be a rare case in
    which one could conclude that a state of automatism was not the product of
    a mental disorder.  The trial judge also acknowledged that the concept of
    a mental disorder or a disease of the mind as employed in the criminal law
    raised legal and policy issues above and beyond the medical questions on
    which a medical expert was entitled to give an opinion.  He referred to Dr.
    Shapiro’s opinion as “highly relevant” but not determinative of whether the
    respondent’s conduct was the product of a mental disorder. </p>

  <h3>D.        DOES THE APPEAL RAISE A QUESTION OF LAW ALONE?</h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:

    an appeal from acquittal in an indictable matter, the Crown is limited to
    questions of law alone: <i>Criminal Code</i>, s. 676(1)(a).  Crown counsel
    argues that the trial judge erred in law in characterizing the respondent’s
    automatism as non-mental disorder automatism.  Counsel refers to several
    specific alleged errors that she contends resulted in this mischaracterization.  Counsel
    argues that the trial judge failed to give any significance to the internal
    causes that contributed to the respondent’s parasomnia.  She further submits
    that the trial judge improperly focused on the likelihood of recurrence of
    non-consensual sexual activity rather than on the likelihood of the recurrence
    of the circumstances that triggered the parasomnia.  Crown counsel also contends
    that the trial judge improperly diminished the significance of the respondent’s
    prior sexsomnia episodes on the basis that those episodes involved persons
    with whom the respondent had a relationship that included consensual sexual
    activity.  Finally, counsel submits that the trial judge wrongly relied on
    Dr. Shapiro’s opinion when considering whether as a matter of policy the
    respondent’s automatism should be characterized as a disease of the mind.  </p>

normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for the respondent, relying primarily on a passage in the majority judgment
    of Bastarache J. in <i>Stone</i>, at para. 197, contends that the Crown’s
    arguments are in reality an attack on the trial judge’s application of the
    undisputed definition of mental disorder to the evidence in this particular
    case.  The respondent contends that this process, the application of legal
    principles to a body of evidence, is characterized in <i>Stone</i> as a question
    of mixed fact and law.  Questions of mixed fact and law are beyond the reach
    of the Crown’s right of appeal.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    can be difficult to distinguish between errors of law alone and errors of
    mixed fact and law.  At times the distinction seems purely semantic: see

    <i> (Director of Investigation and Research) v. Southam Inc.</i> (1997),
    144 D.L.R. (4th) 1 (S.C.C.), at para. 35.  I am, however, satisfied that
    the Crown’s arguments do raise a question of law alone.  In <i>R. v. Morin</i> (1992),
    76 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.), at pp. 198-99, Sopinka J. described a question
    of law in these terms:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If a trial judge finds all the facts necessary to
    reach a conclusion in law and in order to reach that conclusion the facts
    can simply be accepted as found, a court of appeal can disagree with the
    conclusion reached without trespassing on the fact finding function of the
    trial judge.  The disagreement is with respect to the law and not the facts
    nor inferences to be drawn from the facts.</p>

    counsel does not take issue with any of the facts as found by the trial judge
    but directs her arguments at the legal effect of those findings of fact.  Counsel
    contends that on those findings, and applying the principles from <i>Stone</i>,
    the trial judge was obligated as a matter of law to find that the respondent’s
    condition constituted a disease of the mind.  Counsel submits that the classification
    of the respondent’s condition admitted of only one correct answer and as
    such is clearly a question of law. </p>

    149 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (S.C.C.), at p. 460, where the court described a question
    of law as a question involving either the interpretation of a legal standard
    or the application of a legal standard.  The Crown’s appeal involves the
    proper interpretation of the legal standard described by the phrase “mental
    disorder” or its equivalent, “disease of the mind”.  Similarly, the Crown’s
    appeal can be described as a challenge to the application of that legal standard
    to the evidence as accepted by the trial judge.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:

    view that the Crown’s appeal raises a question of law is fortified by this
    court’s decision in <i>R. v. Parks</i> (1990), 56 C.C.C. (3d) 449.  Just
    as in this case, the accused in <i>Parks</i> was acquitted on the basis that
    his actions were the involuntary product of a parasomniac episode.  The trial
    judge held that the evidence raised only the question of non-insane automatism.  The
    Crown appealed claiming that the undisputed defence evidence demonstrated
    that the accused suffered from a disease of the mind.  Galligan J.A., at
    p. 455, noted that the parties agreed that the accused’s parasomnia was either
    a disease of the mind or it was not a disease of the mind.  The issue was
    whether the trial judge made the proper choice from the two available options.  Galligan
    J.A. described the proper characterization of the accused’s automatistic
    state as raising a legal issue. On further appeal to the Supreme Court of
    Canada, (1992), 75 C.C.C. (3d) 287, that court appears to have taken the
    same view.  Although there is no discussion on the point, the Supreme Court
    of Canada’s jurisdiction is limited to questions of law alone and the court
    addressed exactly the same question described by Galligan J.A. in his reasons.  </p>

    claim by an accused that his or her conduct was involuntary and should result
    in an acquittal for that reason can arise in a variety of very different
    circumstances.  Automatism is the legal term used to describe one specific
    kind of involuntary action: see <i>Bratty v. Attorney General for Northern
    Ireland</i>, (1963) 3 All E.R. 523 (H.L.), per Lord Denning at pp. 408-409; <i>Parks</i>,
    per La Forest J. at p. 302.  Automatism refers to involuntary conduct that
    is the product of a mental state in which the conscious mind is disassociated
    from the part of the mind that controls action.  A person in a state of automatism
    may perform acts, sometimes complicated and apparently purposeful acts, but
    have no control over those actions: William Wilson, <i>et al</i>., “Violence,
    Sleepwalking and the Criminal Law: (2) The Legal Aspects” (2005) Crim. L.R.
    614, at pp. 615-16.  North P. put it this way in <i>R. v. Burr</i>, [1969]
    N.Z.L.R. 736 (

      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), at p. 744: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my opinion then there is now clear judicial
    authority for the view that in order for a defence of automatism to succeed, <u>the
    person whose conduct is under review must be unconscious of what he was doing.  In
    short that what he did was an unconscious involuntary act… [I]n my opinion,
    the evidence must be sufficient to lay a proper foundation for the plea that
    the accused person acted through his body and without the assistance of his
    mind, in the sense that he was not able to make the necessary decisions and
    to determine whether or not to do the act.</u>  [Emphasis added.]</p>

    disassociative state that is the hallmark of automatism can be caused by
    many things including disease, mental illness, concussion, drugs, and parasomnia.  Each
    of these conditions can produce a condition in which an accused, while capable
    of complex, apparently goal-oriented conduct, is incapable of exercising
    any control over those actions.  As will be discussed below, the cause of
    the automatism is an important consideration in characterizing the nature
    of the automatism.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:

    automatism “defence” is not a defence in the true sense but is a denial of
    the commission of the <i>actus</i>
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <i>reus</i> of the crime.  Absent the commission of the prohibited act, there
    can be no crime and hence no criminal liability.  A person who is unable
    to decide whether to perform an act and unable to control the performance
    of the act cannot be said, in any meaningful sense, to have committed the
    act.  Nor can it be appropriate in a criminal justice system in which liability
    is predicated on personal responsibility to convict persons based on conduct
    which those persons have no ability to control: see <i>Stone</i>, per Bastarache

    claims raise legitimate questions about an accused’s mental status and his
    or her potential danger to the public.  These claims are almost always advanced
    in cases where the accused has caused serious personal injury or at least
    put members of the public at serious risk.  It hardly seems controversial
    that persons who engage in what would otherwise be regarded as serious criminal
    conduct and claim to have had absolutely no control over that conduct should
    have their mental health and their right to remain at liberty scrutinized.  Automatism
    claims, which by their very nature assert that the accused acted while in
    an abnormal and impaired mental state, inevitably bring into play the exemption
    to criminal liability created by s. 16 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  </p>

    16 exempts persons from criminal responsibility if, as a result of a “mental
    disorder”, they were incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of
    their acts or of knowing that their acts were wrong.  As Binnie J. observed
    in dissent in <i>Stone</i>, at paras. 78-83, s. 16 does not speak to the
    voluntariness of one’s actions but instead addresses cognitive functions
    that assume voluntary conduct.  It is, however, accepted in Canada, and throughout
    the Commonwealth, that a person whose conduct is involuntary because of a
    condition that is the product of a mental disorder falls exclusively within
    the purview of the “insanity” defence: see <i>R. v. Revelle</i> (1979), 48
    C.C.C. (2d) 267 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 271, aff’d (1981), 61 C.C.C. (2d) 575; <i>Rabey </i>(Ont.

    an accused’s automatism is rooted in a mental disorder, the accused will
    not be acquitted but will be found NCR-MD.  Under Part XX.I of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>, a person found NCR-MD is subject to a post-verdict disposition
    hearing before either the trial judge or a Review Board.  Section 672.54
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i> lists the dispositions available.  These range
    from an absolute discharge to confinement in a hospital.  A person found
    NCR-MD must be granted an absolute discharge if the court or review board
    is not satisfied that he or she poses a “significant risk”: see <i>Winko

    distinction between non-mental disorder automatism and mental disorder automatism
    depends on whether the automatistic state is the product of a “mental disorder”.  That
    term is defined in s. 2 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> as a “disease of the
    mind”.  That phrase, which is almost as old as the insanity defence itself,
    describes a legal and not a medical concept, the purpose of which is normative,
    not diagnostic: <i>Rabey</i>, per Martin J.A. at pp. 473-74; <i>Parks</i>,
    per La Forest J. at p. 304.  I will use the two phrases interchangeably.</p>

    broader the definition of mental disorder, the narrower the ambit of the “defence” of
    non-mental disorder automatism.  Canadian courts have adopted a very broad
    definition.  In <i>R. v. Cooper</i> (1980), 51 C.C.C. (2d) 129 (S.C.C.),
    at p. 144, Dickson J. said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In summary, one might say that in a legal sense “disease
    of the mind” embraces any illness, disorder or abnormal condition which impairs
    the human mind and its functioning, excluding however, self-induced states
    caused by alcohol or drugs, as well as transitory mental states such as hysteria
    or concussion.</p>

    Brudner has described the effect of this broad definition in these terms:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Clearly the definition of mental disease elaborated
    by the courts in the aforementioned cases bears little resemblance to any
    that a psychiatrist might proffer.  <u>It is a legal rather than a medical
    definition
    – one carefully crafted with a view to a policy of controlling persons thought
    to be dangerous.</u>  This definition ensures, first of all, that anyone
    accused of a crime who lacked conscious choice because of a dangerous and
    potentially recurrent disorder or event will not go free but will be subject
    to continued detention and confinement after acquittal.  Obversely, it ensures
    that only those whose lack of conscious choice was caused by an external
    and probably non-recurrent event will have the benefit of a defence that
    leads to an absolute acquittal and a return to society.<a

    that trial judges should start with the assumption that the condition constitutes
    a disease of the mind.  Trial judges should then look to the evidence to
    determine whether that presumption has been rebutted.  After <i>Stone</i>,
    many argue that successful claims of non-mental disorder automatism will
    be limited to those very rare “one off” cases
     in  which  an accused suffers  a single incident of automatism, and where </p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>the accused can point to some specific
    external event that precipitated that event, can demonstrate that the event
    is unlikely to reoccur, and finally, can show that the event could have produced
    a disassociative state in an otherwise “normal” person.</p>

    over 100 years, leading criminal law jurists and academics accepted without
    question that parasomnias, like sleepwalking, constituted the prototypical
    example of non-insane automatism warranting a full acquittal.  For example,
    Stephen J. in <i>R. v. Tolson</i>, [1889] 23 Q.B.D. 168 (C.C.R.), at p. 187,
    observed:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Can anyone doubt that a man who, though he might
    be perfectly sane, committed what would otherwise be a crime in a state of
    somnambulism, would be entitled to be acquitted?  And why is this?  Simply
    because he would not know what he was doing.</p>

    seemed to withstand the trend towards the treatment of virtually all automatistic
    behaviour as the product of a disease of the mind.  However, in none of the
    cases in which the courts accepted that parasomnia amounted to non-mental
    disorder automatism did the accused actually advance parasomnia as an explanation
    for his or her automatism.  The references to parasomnia in the judgments
    were <i>obiter</i> and were usually by way of explaining why the automatism
    defence actually advanced by the accused should not result in an acquittal.  Put
    bluntly, in none of these cases was the court faced with the prospect of
    acquitting a parasomniac who had committed what would otherwise be a serious
    crime.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>in a series of activities including
    leaving his own home, getting into his car, driving across town on a busy
    highway to the home of his in-laws, entering their home, and attacking them
    while they were asleep.  The accused killed his mother-in-law and seriously
    injured his father-in-law and then drove to the police station covered in
    blood.  The defence led uncontradicted expert evidence to the effect that
    the accused’s condition rendered him incapable of controlling his actions
    and did not constitute a mental disorder.  The trial judge did not leave
    NCR-MD as a possible verdict but instructed the jury that they should acquit
    if they had a reasonable doubt as to the voluntariness of the accused’s actions.  The
    jury acquitted and the Crown appealed.  This court affirmed the acquittal,

'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    present purposes, I will focus on the reasons of La Forest J., delivered
    for a six-person majority in the Supreme Court of Canada.  La Forest J. began
    by recognizing that the appeal turned on the characterization of the respondent’s
    automatistic state as either “insane” or “non-insane” automatism.  Just as
    in this case, the accused had led evidence that his actions were involuntary
    and claimed an acquittal based on that evidence.  Again, just as in this
    case, the Crown denied that the actions were involuntary and alternatively
    argued that if the actions were involuntary, they were the product of a mental
    disorder and should result in an insanity verdict and not an acquittal.  La
    Forest J. observed that as the Crown had raised the insanity issue in response
    to the accused’s contention that his actions were involuntary, the Crown
    had the onus to prove that the accused’s condition stemmed from a disease
    of the mind: <i>Parks</i>, at pp. 304, 311.  In placing the onus on the Crown,
    La Forest J. relied on s. 16(4) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> (now s. 16(3)).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Having
    placed the onus on the Crown, La Forest J. turned to the proper characterization
    of sleepwalking.  He did not simply adopt the cases that had described parasomnia
    as a self-evident example of non-insane automatism but instead held that
    parasomnia may or may not be a mental disorder depending on the evidence
    led in a particular case: <i>Parks</i>, at p. 311.<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span

    Forest J. emphasized, at pp. 304-305, that the phrase “disease of the mind” was
    a legal and not a medical term.  The experts described Parks’ disassociative
    mental state as the product of sleep and not the product of sleepwalking,
    an admittedly abnormal condition.  According to the experts, sleep was a
    normal process that could not be characterized as a
    “disease of the mind”.<a href="#_ftn11"

    Forest J. did not stop at the experts’
    characterization of the accused’s disassociative state.  He emphasized that
    a proper characterization demanded a consideration of factors beyond those
    relevant to the medical diagnosis, stating at p. 302:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In distinguishing between automatism and insanity
    the trial judge must consider more than the evidence; there are overarching
    policy considerations as well.  Of course, the evidence in each case will
    be highly relevant to this policy inquiry.</p>

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Forest J. next observed, at p. 305, that the policy component of the definition
    of “disease of the mind” focused on the protection of the public.  He referred
    with approval to the observations of Martin J.A. in <i>Rabey</i>, at p. 473:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The legal or policy component relates to (a) the
    scope of the exemption from criminal responsibility to be afforded by mental
    disorder or disturbance, and (b) the protection of the public by the control
    and treatment of persons who have caused serious harms while in a mentally
    disordered or disturbed state.  </p>

    Forest J. and Martin J.A. both acknowledged that public safety considerations
    may dictate that any abnormal mental state rendering a person incapable of
    controlling his or her conduct should be characterized as a disease of the
    mind regardless of the medical characterization or diagnosis.  The legal
    characterization of the condition as a “disease of the mind” places the accused
    within the s. 16 exemption to criminal liability and forecloses an outright
    acquittal.  Those who are exempted from criminal liability under s. 16 are
    subject to a post-verdict inquiry into their dangerousness.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>La
    Forest J. identified two approaches that have been used to distinguish non-insane
    automatism from insane automatism.  One approach looked to the cause of the
    condition and differentiated between causes internal to an accused’s physical
    or emotional make-up and causes that were entirely external to the accused.  The
    second approach examined the extent to which the accused, because of the
    nature of the condition, posed a continuing danger to the community.  He
    said at p. 306:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The “continuing danger” theory holds that any condition
    likely to present a recurring danger to the public should be treated as insanity.  The “internal
    cause” theory suggests that a condition stemming from the psychological or
    emotional make-up of the accused, rather than some external factor, should
    lead to a finding of insanity.  <u>The two theories share a common concern
    for recurrence, the latter holding that an internal weakness is more likely
    to lead to recurrent violence than automatism brought on by some intervening
    external cause.</u>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:normal;

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Forest J. indicated that neither approach necessarily provided a definitive
    answer to the characterization problem presented in any given case.  Rather,
    the two approaches should be treated as analytical tools to be used in answering
    the ultimate policy inquiry – does the protection of the public dictate that
    the accused’s disordered mental state should be treated as a disease of the
    mind?    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>La
    Forest J. applied these analytical tools to the evidence.  He concluded,
    at p. 307, that the distinction between internal and external causes was
    not helpful in characterizing parasomnias.  With respect to the ongoing danger,
    if any, posed by the accused, La Forest J. observed at p. 310:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is clear from the evidence that there is almost
    no likelihood of recurrent violent somnambulism.  A finding of insanity is
    therefore less likely, but the absence of a continuing danger does not mean
    that the respondent must be granted an absolute acquittal.  </p>

normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    determining that neither the causal or ongoing danger analysis provided any
    clear insight as to the proper characterization of sleepwalking, La Forest
    J. adverted to additional potentially relevant policy considerations.  These
    considerations proceed from the premise that some automatism claims are feigned
    and that if automatism claims are too readily accepted by the courts, the
    administration of justice will be brought into disrepute.  These concerns
    are sometimes described as due administration of justice concerns.  I confess
    to some difficulty in understanding how concerns about the legitimacy of
    a defence should affect the characterization of an accused’s mental state.  In
    any event, La Forest J. concluded that due administration of justice concerns
    were irrelevant to the characterization of parasomnia.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Forest J. ultimately concluded at p. 311:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In the end, there are no compelling policy factors
    that preclude a finding that the accused’s condition was one of non-insane
    automatism.  I noted earlier that it is for the Crown to prove that somnambulism
    stems from a disease of the mind; neither the evidence nor policy considerations
    in this case overcome the Crown’s burden in that regard… [T]he accused should
    be acquitted.   </p>

'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    is evident, La Forest J. ultimately decided the characterization issue by
    resort to the burden of proof.  On La Forest J.’s analysis, the accused succeeded
    not because he showed his condition to be one of non-insane automatism but
    because the Crown failed to prove that the condition should be characterized
    as insane automatism.  </p>
  <h3>(iii)     <i>R. v. Stone</i>, Automatism Reconsidered</h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:normal;

    come now to <i>R. v. Stone</i>.  The accused stabbed his wife 47 times.  At
    his murder trial, he claimed that he was in a disassociative state brought
    on by the
    “psychological blows” inflicted by his wife.  According to the appellant,
    in the hours prior to the homicide, his wife had made many insulting and
    derisive comments toward him.  The accused argued that his actions were involuntary
    and not the product of a disease of the mind.  At trial, the defence sought
    an acquittal and alternatively a finding of NCR-MD.  The jury convicted the
    accused of manslaughter and the British Columbia Court of Appeal upheld the
    conviction.  </p>

'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Bastarache
    J., at p. 419, speaking for a five-person majority, announced that he would “develop
    a general test applicable to all claims of automatism.”  He proceeded to
    substantially rewrite the case law.  Bastarache J. began by determining that
    the onus of proof should be on the accused to demonstrate on the balance
    of probabilities that his actions were involuntary.  This reversal of the
    onus of proof on an essential element of the offence is perhaps the most
    controversial aspect of the ruling in <i>Stone</i>.  It is not, however,
    directly germane to the outcome of this appeal.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    second part of the reasons of Bastarache J. is central to the outcome of
    this appeal.  Bastarache J. held that in those cases where an accused had
    established a proper evidentiary basis to put voluntariness in issue, the
    trial judge was required to decide at the end of the evidence whether the
    claim amounted to one of non-mental disorder automatism or mental disorder
    automatism.  If the claim was properly characterized as mental disorder automatism
    an acquittal was not available and the trier of fact should be instructed
    only on the defence of not criminally responsible by reason of mental disorder.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Bastarache
    J. acknowledged that the distinction between non-mental disorder automatism
    and mental disorder automatism depended on the definition of the phrase “disease
    of the mind”.  After referring to the position taken by the Canadian Psychiatric
    Association before a committee of the House of Commons to the effect that
    all automatism claims should be treated as mental disorder claims, Bastarache
    J. said at pp. 432-33:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I take judicial notice that it will only be in rare
    cases that automatism is not caused by mental disorder.  Indeed, since the
    trial judge will have already concluded that there is evidence upon which
    a properly instructed jury could find that the accused acted involuntarily
    on a balance of probabilities, there is a serious question as to the existence
    of an operating mind by the time the disease of the mind is considered.  The
    foregoing lends itself to a rule that trial judges start from the proposition
    that the condition the accused claims to have suffered from is a disease
    of the mind.  They must then determine whether the evidence in the particular
    case takes the condition out of the disease of the mind category.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Bastarache
    J. took the position that anyone who committed what would otherwise be a
    criminal act and led evidence capable of establishing that his or her actions
    were involuntary was presumptively suffering from a disease of the mind.  This
    presumption fundamentally changes the legal landscape set out in <i>Parks</i> where,
    it will be recalled, the non-mental disorder automatism claim succeeded because
    the Crown could not prove that the accused’s condition constituted a disease
    of the mind.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Like
    La Forest J. in <i>Parks</i>, Bastarache J. would not accept that any single
    approach or criterion could be used to distinguish between non-mental disorder
    automatism and mental disorder automatism.  Bastarache J. described a “holistic
    approach” that took into consideration the cause of the condition, the continuing
    danger presented to the public, the due administration of justice policy
    concerns identified in earlier cases and any other factors made germane to
    the inquiry by the facts of the particular case.  He said at p. 441:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><u>[T]he fundamental question of mixed law and fact
      which is at the centre of the disease of mind inquiry: whether society
      requires protection from the accused and, consequently, whether the accused

      of the (<i>Criminal</i>) <i>Code</i>.</u> [Emphasis added.]</p>

    J.’s consideration of the continuing danger factor is germane to this appeal.  He
    observes at p. 439:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In examining the continuing danger factor, trial
    judges may consider any of the evidence before them in order to assess the
    likelihood of recurrence of violence.  <u>However, two issues will be particularly
    relevant to the continuing danger factor: the psychiatric history of the
    accused and the likelihood that the trigger alleged to have caused the automatistic
    episode will recur.</u>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Bastarache
    J. explained that a documented history of automatistic-like disassociative
    states suggested that the condition suffered by the accused was a recurring
    one.  The likelihood of recurrence and more specifically the recurrence of
    violence during an automatistic state was also enhanced by the fact that
    on at least one prior occasion, the occasion leading to the criminal charge,
    the accused had engaged in violent conduct while in an automatistic state.  The
    prior history combined with the prior violent incident indicated that the
    accused’s condition was “likely to be classified as a disease of the mind”: <i>Stone</i>,
    at p. 439.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    addressing the significance of the likelihood of the recurrence of the conditions
    that triggered the automatistic state, Bastarache J. noted that it was difficult
    to predict the actual recurrence of violence.  However, the predictability
    of the automatistic state in which the violence occurred depended on the
    likelihood of the recurrence of the triggering events.  He said at p. 440:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[A]n assessment of the likelihood that the particular
    accused will again encounter the trigger alleged to have caused the current
    automatistic episode, or a similar one of at least equal severity, may assist
    a judge in assessing the continuing danger factor.  <u>The greater the anticipated
    frequency of the trigger in the accused’s life, the greater the risk posed
    to the public and, consequently, the more likely it is that the condition
    alleged by the accused is a disease of the mind.</u><a href="#_ftn12"

    J. then applied his “holistic approach” to the evidence in the case before
    him.  He stressed the absence of any extraordinary external event that could
    cause a normal person to disassociate.  In the absence of any such explanation,
    the accused’s condition was presumptively a product of a disease of the mind.  </p>

    the approach to the characterization of automatism as non-mental disorder
    automatism or mental disorder automatism in at least two significant ways.  First,
    after <i>Stone</i> the trial judge must begin from the premise that the automatism
    is caused by a disease of the mind and look to the evidence to determine
    whether it convinces him or her that the condition is not a “disease of the
    mind”.  This approach is in direct contrast with <i>Parks</i> where the non-mental
    disorder automatism claim succeeded because the Crown failed to prove that
    the condition was caused by a disease of the mind.</p>

    of the characterization of the automatism set out in <i>Parks</i>, it refocuses
    the continuing danger aspect of that approach.  After <i>Stone</i>, in evaluating
    the risk of repetition and hence the danger to the public, trial judges must
    not limit their inquiry only to the risk of further violence while in an
    automatistic state.  Rather, trial judges must examine the risk of the recurrence
    of the factors or events that triggered the accused’s automatistic state.  Commenting
    on this refinement of the continuing danger inquiry Professor Paciocco observes
    in
    “Death by Stone-ing: The Demise of the Defence of Simple Automatism” at p.
    281:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This part of the judgment effectively reverses <i>Parks</i>.  The
    triggers for Parks’ somnambulism or sleep-walking included stress, fatigue,
    insomnia and exercise.  There is no point in speaking of the likelihood of
    such triggers being present in the future.  It is a veritable certainty that
    they will be.  <u>It is clear that had Parks been tried using the <i>Stone</i> test,
    the only defence that would have been left to the jury would be “mental disorder
    automatism”.</u>  [Emphasis added.]</p>

    Paciocco’s prediction is largely borne out by the Canadian parasomnia cases
    that post-date <i>Stone</i>.  I am aware of five including this case.  In
    the other four cases, the automatistic states flowing from the parasomnia
    were held to constitute diseases of the mind: see <i>Canada v. Campbell </i>(2000),
    35 C.R. (5th) 314 (Ont. S.C); <i>R. v. Balenko</i>, [2000] Q.J. No. 717 (C.Q.
    (Crim. Div.)); <i>R. v. Romas</i> (2002), 6 M.V.R. (5th) 101 (B.C. Prov.

    majority position in <i>Stone</i> signals a strong preference for a finding
    of NCR-MD in cases where an accused establishes that he or she was in a disassociative
    state and acted involuntarily.  Social defence concerns, inevitably present
    in such cases, must to a large degree drive the analysis in automatism cases
    after <i>Stone</i>.    </p>

    strong preference for an NCR-MD verdict expressed in <i>Stone</i> is explained
    in part by the very different treatment accorded those found NCR-MD compared
    to the historical treatment provided to those found not guilty by reason
    of insanity, as was the case at the time of the trial in <i>Parks</i>.  Prior
    to 1991, persons found not guilty by reason of insanity were detained indefinitely
    at the pleasure of the Lieutenant Governor in Council.  The provisions of
    Part XX.I of the <i>Criminal Code</i> not only disposed of the insanity nomenclature
    but completely changed the post-verdict treatment of those found NCR-MD:
    S.C. 1991, c. 43.  </p>

    do not think it is coincidental that <i>Stone</i> and <i>Winko</i>, the leading
    case on the interpretation of Part XX.I of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, were
    heard by the same nine judges about ten days apart, and decided about three
    weeks apart several months later.  It is hard to resist the inference that <i>Stone</i> was
    written having in mind what the court would say three weeks later when it
    released its decision in <i>Winko</i>.  </p>

    McLachlin J. explained the operation of Part XX.I this way at para. 43:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In summary, the purpose of Part XX.I is to replace
    the common law regime for the treatment of those who offend while mentally
    ill with a new approach emphasizing individualized assessment and the provision
    of opportunities  for appropriate treatment.  Under Part XX.I, the NCR accused
    is neither convicted nor acquitted.  Instead, he or she is found not criminally
    responsible by reason of illness at the time of the offence.  <u>This is
    not a finding of dangerousness.  It is rather a finding that triggers a balanced
    assessment of the offender’s possible dangerousness and of what treatment-associated
    measures are required to offset it.  Throughout the process the offender
    is to be treated with dignity and accorded the maximum liberty compatible
    with Part XX.I’s goals of public protection and fairness to the NCR accused.</u>  [Emphasis

    a detailed examination of s. 672.54, the provision governing the dispositions
    available with respect to persons found NCR-MD.  As interpreted in <i>Winko</i>,
    s. 672.54 requires the absolute discharge of anyone found NCR-MD unless the
    court or the Review Board determines that the individual poses “a significant
    threat to the public”.  McLachlin J. said at para. 52:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This interpretation of s. 672.54 eliminates any
    need for the NCR accused to prove lack of dangerousness and relieves him
    or her of any legal or evidentiary burden.  If the evidence does not support
    the conclusion that the NCR accused is a significant risk, the NCR accused
    need do nothing; the only possible order is an absolute discharge.  </p>

    risk determination required by s. 672.54 cannot not be based on speculation
    or assumptions about how persons with mental disorders behave.  There must
    be evidence establishing the significant risk.  That risk must be a real
    risk of criminal conduct involving physical or psychological harm to individuals
    in the community.  A risk of trivial harm or miniscule risk of significant
    harm will not suffice to deprive the individual of his or her liberty: <i>Winko</i>,
    at para. 57.</p>

    explained in <i>Winko</i>, there are also significant procedural safeguards
    built into Part XX.I of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  A person found NCR-MD
    must receive a timely disposition hearing before either the court or the
    Review Board.  He or she has full access to the bail provisions pending that
    hearing.  The disposition hearing is not adversarial but provides for a full
    and wide-ranging inquiry into all factors relevant to the appropriate disposition.  The
    disposition hearing allows for the input of medical professionals who will
    have had a chance to assess the person found NCR-MD and to develop opinions
    based on an up-to-date assessment of that person’s condition.  Where, as
    in most cases, the disposition hearing is before the Review Board, the panel
    will include a psychiatrist.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:

    combined reading of <i>Stone</i> and <i>Winko</i> yields a comprehensive
    response to automatism claims.  At the pre-verdict stage, social defence
    concerns dominate.  Those concerns focus on the risk posed by the potential
    recurrence of the conduct in issue.  Where that risk exists, the risk combined
    with the occurrence of the conduct that led to the criminal proceedings will
    almost always justify further inquiry into the accused’s dangerousness so
    as to properly protect the public.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:

    the post-verdict stage, however, the emphasis shifts to an individualized
    assessment of the actual dangerousness of the person found NCR-MD.  Where
    that personalized assessment does not demonstrate the requisite significant
    risk, the person found NCR-MD must receive an absolute discharge.  Even where
    a significant risk exists, the disposition order must be tailored to the
    specific circumstances of the individual and must, to the extent possible,
    minimize the interference with that individual’s liberty.</p>

      Romas</i>, [2002] B.C.R.B.D. No. 66 (British Columbia Review Board), provides
      an example of the integration of the <i>Stone</i> approach to automatism
      and the <i>Winko</i> approach to Part XX.I of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  At
      trial (<i>R. v. Romas</i>), the accused was charged with an assault-related
      offence and claimed to have acted as a result of Confusional Sleep Arousal,
      a sleep disorder.  Applying <i>Stone</i>, the accused was found NCR-MD.  The
      trial judge referred the matter to the British Columbia Review Board for
      disposition.  About six weeks later the Board, by a majority vote, ordered
      the accused absolutely discharged.  In so ordering, the Board referred
      to several factors, all of which would seem applicable to the respondent
      assuming his current condition is consistent with that described at trial.   </p>
  <h3>(iv)      The Trial Judge’s Application of the Principles in <i>R. v. Stone</i>  </h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    am satisfied that the trial judge failed to appreciate the significance of
    the hereditary nature of the respondent’s condition, failed to give effect
    to the respondent’s well established history of sexsomnia, and failed to
    appreciate the significance of the strong likelihood of the recurrence of
    the events that triggered his sexsomnia.  The trial judge also failed to
    appreciate that Dr. Shapiro’s medical opinion that parasomnia did not constitute
    a mental disorder was largely irrelevant to the determination of whether,
    for policy reasons, the condition should be classified legally as a disease
    of the mind.  These errors led to a failure to apply the proper legal standard
    when characterizing the respondent’s automatism.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When
    addressing the cause of the respondent’s condition, the trial judge acknowledged
    that causes internal to the accused, be they physical or mental, were generally
    treated as indicative of a disease of the mind, while causes external to
    the accused were generally indicative of a non-mental disorder automatism.  The
    trial judge then said at para. 46:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The jurisprudence recognizes that somnambulism,
    as in the <i>Parks</i> case, is not suitable to this kind of analysis.  Somnambulism
    is not a disease of the mind.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge was wrong to categorically indicate that somnambulism is not
    a disease of the mind.  As <i>Parks</i> made clear, it may or may not be
    depending on the evidence.  More significantly to the outcome of this case,
    I think the trial judge erred in dismissing the potential significance of
    the causes of the respondent’s condition by referring to jurisprudence that
    had dismissed the internal/external cause distinction as being of no assistance
    in parasomnia cases.  The trial judge should have considered whether, on
    the evidence, the causes of the parasomnia as explained by Dr. Shapiro offered
    any insight into the risk of recurrence and hence the potential danger to
    the public.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    the cause of parasomnia may not fit within the “external/internal” causal
    dichotomy described in the case law, Dr. Shapiro’s evidence establishes that
    the predisposition for parasomnia, found in some three per cent of the adult
    population, is hereditary.  A genetic predisposition is the epitome of an
    internal cause.  Although that disposition does not cause the particular
    automatistic event, it does predispose the individual to that condition thereby
    increasing the risk of recurrence.  The trial judge erred in discounting
    the significance of this internal cause of the respondent’s condition.  He
    did so based on a misapprehension of the “sleepwalking” case law and a failure
    to consider evidence relevant to the causal inquiry.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge’s treatment of the “continuing danger” component of the meaning
    of “disease of the mind” reveals two errors.  First, he found that prior
    sexsomnia incidents did not assist in assessing the danger to the public
    because those incidents did not involve criminal conduct.  While technically
    the conduct did involve non-consensual sexual activity, I certainly accept
    that it was not conduct that should attract a criminal charge.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Even
    though the incidents involving former girlfriends did not lead to criminal
    charges, they were important in assessing the risk posed by the respondent’s
    conduct.  These events correspond to the psychiatric history of prior automatistic
    episodes stressed in <i>Stone</i>.  The respondent’s prior sexsomnia episodes
    demonstrate that his conduct toward L.O. was not an isolated, “one-off”
    incident.  There were episodes both prior to and subsequent to the attack
    on L.O. during which the respondent engaged in sexual activity at a time
    when he was unaware of what he was doing and unable to control himself.  In
    that condition the respondent could not distinguish between a consenting
    partner and a non-consenting victim.  The identity of the subject of the
    sexual activity was a matter of chance, not a matter of choice.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    accept that it is perhaps more probable that the respondent would be asleep
    with or near someone with whom he had a relationship involving consensual
    sexual relations.  It cannot, however, be unexpected that the respondent
    will find himself asleep in the vicinity of persons with whom he has no relationship.  One
    thinks of an airport or train station waiting room or the sleeping arrangements
    at a friend’s cottage.  There is also nothing in the evidence to suggest
    that the respondent could not move from room to room while in a parasomniac
    state and engage in non-consensual sexual activity with someone who happens
    to be in same building but in a different room.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>With
    respect to the trial judge, his rejection of the prior sexsomnia incidents
    as having no value in considering whether the respondent posed a risk runs
    contrary to the fundamental nature of the defence advanced by the respondent.  It
    was central to his position that he had no awareness of what he was doing
    and no control over his actions.  It must follow that he was incapable of
    distinguishing between a consensual or non-consensual situation while in
    a parasomniac state.  The trial judge should not have relied on a distinction
    that the accused was incapable of making to diminish the risk posed by the
    respondent.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    second error made by the trial judge in examining the “continuing danger” factor
    arises from his failure to consider the likelihood that the respondent would
    encounter the events or circumstances that triggered his parasomnia.  <i>Stone</i>,
    at p. 440, explicitly directs trial judges to look to the likelihood of the
    recurrence of the triggering events and not just the likelihood of the recurrence
    of acts of violence while in an automatistic state.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[112]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    triggers in this case included alcohol, fatigue and stress.  These are common
    place in most people’s lives, particularly in the life of a busy, socially
    active, young man.  Had the trial judge addressed the likelihood of the recurrence
    of the triggering events he would no doubt have found that it was virtually
    inevitable that some combination of these events would recur and recur with
    some frequency.  On the analysis in <i>Stone</i>, the likelihood of recurrence
    of these triggering events offers significant support for a finding that
    the respondent’s parasomnia should be characterized as a disease of the mind.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[113]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge also placed considerable emphasis on the firmness of Dr. Shapiro’s
    evidence that the respondent’s parasomnia did not constitute a disease of
    the mind.  Dr. Shapiro’s opinion that parasomnia did not constitute a disease
    of the mind, as opposed to his explanation of parasomnia and his opinion
    that the respondent was in a parasomniac state, had little or no evidentiary
    value.  Nor was the force with which he held that opinion of any significance.  As
    Martin J.A. observed in <i>Rabey</i>, at p. 474:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Indeed, in strictness, a medical witness is not
    entitled to state that a particular condition is or is not a disease of the
    mind since that is a legal question.  In practice, however, it is often convenient
    and permissible, in the discretion of the Judge, for a medical witness to
    testify in those terms.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[114]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge should not have been influenced by Dr. Shapiro’s opinion as to
    the proper categorization of the respondent’s medical condition when deciding
    whether as a matter of law and for policy reasons that condition should or
    should not be characterized as a disease of the mind.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Addario for the respondent ably, although ultimately unsuccessfully, defended
    the reasoning of the trial judge.  Near the end of his oral submissions he
    opened a second front in support of his position that the appeal must be
    dismissed.  Mr. Addario submitted that even if a strict application of the
    analysis set out in <i>Stone</i> might suggest an NCR-MD verdict, it would
    be grossly unfair and unjust to the respondent to label him NCR-MD.  Mr.
    Addario submitted that as wrongheaded as it no doubt is, there is a very
    strong negative stereotype of persons found to be NCR-MD.  Mr Addario submits
    that the reality of the respondent’s medical condition and his life in general
    could not be further from that stereotype.  He contends that the respondent’s
    parasomnia would not be regarded by any reasonable member of the community
    as the kind of mental disorder associated with a finding of NCR-MD.  Mr Addario
    forcefully argues that, just as the criminal justice system must be concerned
    with illegitimate automatism claims, it must be concerned that verdicts in
    automatism cases bear some resemblance to the community’s concept of those
    who should or should not be found NCR-MD.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[116]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    is considerable force in Mr. Addario’s submissions.  Clearly no reasonable
    member of the community would, or should, regard the respondent as mentally
    ill.  Indeed, the inappropriateness of labelling persons with parasomnia
    as mentally ill was acknowledged by
    <st1:Street w:st="on">

    agree with Mr. Addario’s contention that the result in criminal proceedings
    should, at least on a general level, reflect the community’s perception of
    the appropriate result.  Proper labelling is important to the maintaining
    of the integrity of the criminal justice process.  It would be preferable
    if the <i>Criminal Code</i> allowed the court, where it was deemed necessary,
    to specifically identify in its verdict the condition that caused the involuntary
    actions, e.g. not criminally responsible on account of parasomnia: see Ebrahim, <i>et
    al</i>., at p. 612.  Unfortunately the <i>Criminal Code</i> does not provide
    for that flexibility.  Arguably, neither of the available verdicts, not guilty
    or NCR-MD, would be regarded by the community as particularly apt labels
    for the respondent.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[118]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    second part of Mr. Addario’s submission would have the court accept the negative
    stereotyping of those found NCR-MD and decline to impose that verdict on
    the respondent because he does not fit that stereotype.  No one should deny
    the existence of this negative stereotype and the harm it can do to those
    found NCR-MD.  To give effect to Mr. Addario’s submission would, however,
    promote this negative stereotype.  Were the court to decline to find the
    respondent NCR-MD because he does not fit the negative stereotype of persons
    so found, the court could be taken as accepting that those who are found
    NCR-MD do fit that stereotype.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:

    new mental disorder regime introduced into the <i>Criminal Code</i> in 1991
    is intended to overcome the improper stereotyping of persons found NCR-MD
    and to provide for individualized assessment and treatment of those individuals:
    see <i>Winko</i>, at paras. 35-40.  The courts can best play a role in the
    important task of overcoming the negative stereotypes associated with mental
    illness, not by shaping their verdicts to conform to those stereotypes, but
    by emphasizing both the basis for a finding of NCR-MD and by explaining what
    the verdict means.  An NCR-MD verdict signals that an accused cannot be held
    responsible for what would otherwise be his or her criminal act.  At the
    same time, it rejects any suggestion that the accused represents an automatic
    danger to the public.  Instead, the NCR-MD verdict triggers an individualized,
    careful, current assessment of the accused’s condition leading to a disposition
    tailored to the individual accused.</p>

      NCR-MD verdict, and under the terms of s. 686(4) can only order a new trial.  She
      further submitted that s. 686(8) does not allow this court to limit the
      new trial to the determination of whether the respondent’s automatism constituted
      non-mental disorder automatism resulting in an acquittal, or mental disorder
      automatism resulting in an NCR-MD verdict.  In their written reply, counsel
      for the respondent agreed that this court cannot substitute an NCR-MD verdict.  They
      contend, however, that the court can and should make an order under s.
      686(8) limiting the scope of the new trial.  Counsel argued that the Crown
      should not be permitted to re-litigate the voluntariness of the respondent’s
      conduct.  The new trial should be directed only at determining whether
      that involuntary conduct should result in an acquittal or an NCR-MD verdict.  </p>

    686(4) specifically provides for two remedies if a Crown appeal from acquittal
    is successful.  The court may order a new trial, or if the original verdict
    was not returned by a jury, substitute a conviction.  Section 686(4) says
    nothing about the court’s power to substitute an NCR-MD verdict for an acquittal.  Nor
    is there anything in the language of s. 686(4) to suggest that the power
    to substitute an NCR-MD verdict is implicit in the language of that section.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[125]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    absence of any reference in s. 686(4) to the power to substitute an NCR-MD
    verdict for an acquittal takes on added significance when one examines the
    powers of the Court of Appeal on appeals from conviction.  Section 686(2)(b)
    provides that the court can set aside a conviction and order a new trial.  A
    different section, s. 686(1)(d), expressly allows a court of appeal to substitute
    an NCR-MD verdict for a conviction where that conviction is set aside on
    a conviction appeal.  In <i>R. v. Warsing</i> (1998), 130 C.C.C. (3d) 259
    (S.C.C.), Major J., for the majority, read the two remedial sections as providing
    alternative remedies on an appeal from conviction where an appellant’s sanity
    was challenged for the first time on appeal.  After examining the two provisions,
    he said at para. 68:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Without s. 686(1)(d) a court of appeal would not
    be able to substitute a verdict of NCRMD as s. 686(1)(a) and s. 686(2) [the
    new trial provisions] alone do not provide for this remedy.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:

    is no equivalent to s. 686(1)(d) applicable to appeals from acquittals.  On
    the reasoning in <i>Warsing</i>, this court can only order a new trial and
    cannot substitute an NCR-MD verdict on a successful Crown appeal from an
    acquittal.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:

    686(4) is far from a masterpiece of legislative draftsmanship.  As pointed
    out in <i>R. v. Yelle</i> (2006), 213 C.C.C. (3d) 20 (Alt.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), the section provides no express remedies on a successful Crown appeal
    from a trial judgment that had ordered a stay of proceedings.  In <i>Yelle</i>,
    Martin J.A., at paras. 34-38, expressed the opinion that the absence of any
    remedial provision reflected a clear legislative oversight which if left
    uncorrected would cause significant harm to the administration of justice.  Martin
    J.A. read the statutory power to order a new trial found in s. 686(4) as
    including the power to make an order directing the continuation of the initial
    trial where the Crown appeal was from an order staying that trial.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:

    reasoning in <i>Yelle</i> is compelling, however, I do not think I can apply
    that reasoning to this case.  Parliament has clearly turned its mind to the
    circumstances in which the Court of Appeal may substitute an NCR-MD verdict.  It
    has chosen to extend that power on conviction appeals but not on appeals
    from acquittals.  An appellate court’s remedial powers on Crown appeals have
    traditionally been much more circumscribed than appellate powers on conviction
    appeals.  I doubt that the absence of a power to substitute an NCR-MD verdict
    on a Crown appeal from an acquittal in a non-jury case reflects a considered
    policy decision.  However, I cannot say that it clearly demonstrates a legislative
    oversight justifying a judicial rewrite of the provision.  </p>

    686(4) by its clear language provides for only two remedies on appeals from
    acquittals entered by judges sitting without juries.  This court may order
    a new trial, or enter a conviction.  Obviously this is not a case for a conviction.  A
    new trial is the only possible remedy.   </p>

    come now to whether this court can make an order limiting the issues at the
    new trial.  While counsel disagree as to the existence of the power to limit
    the new trial, they do agree that if the power exists it must be found in
    s. 686(8):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Where a court of appeal exercises any of the powers
    conferred by subsection (2), (4), (6) or (7), it may make any order, in addition,
    that justice requires.</p>

normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[131]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section
    686(8) creates a broad discretionary power to make a wide variety of orders
    ancillary to the primary order made under the remedial provisions in s. 686: <i>R.
    v. P. (D.W.)</i> (1987), 49 C.C.C. (3d) 417 (S.C.C.), at pp. 419-20; <i>Thomas</i>,
    at para. 19.  There are, however, limits on the reach of s. 686(8).  It does
    not create a free standing remedial power but provides a supplementary power
    that may be used, where justice requires, to augment the remedial powers
    found elsewhere in s. 686.  As a supplementary power, an order made under
    s. 686(8) cannot be at variance with the primary order made in any given
    case.  Nor can an order made under s. 686(8) be inconsistent with the remedial
    powers granted under the other provisions in s. 686.  For example, s. 686(8)
    could not be used to substitute a conviction on a Crown appeal from an acquittal
    entered by a jury: see <i>R. v. Pearson</i> (1998), 130 C.C.C. (3d) 293 (S.C.C.),
    at para. 14; <i>Thomas</i>, at paras. 17, 21-22.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[132]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    court has previously held that the remedial power in s. 686(8) is broad enough
    to permit, in unusual circumstances, an order limiting the scope of a new
    trial.  In <i>Reference Re
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Regina v. Gorecki</i> <i>(No. 2) </i>(1976), 32 C.C.C. (2d) 135, the court
    received fresh evidence directed at the sanity of the accused at the time
    of the homicide.  The court concluded that a new trial should be directed
    and that the new trial should be limited to the insanity issue.  In <i>R.
    v. Wade</i> (1994), 89 C.C.C. (3d) 39, reversed on other grounds (1995),
    98 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (S.C.C.), this court directed a new trial limited to whether
    the accused was guilty of murder or manslaughter.  In <i>Wade</i> the accused
    claimed that he was in an automatistic state at the time of the homicides
    as a result of certain sleep disorders.  The jury rejected that claim and
    convicted the accused.  The court held that there was non-direction on the
    included offence of manslaughter.  It further held, however, that the issue
    of the voluntariness of the accused’s conduct had been fully and fairly litigated.  Consequently
    the court, relying on s. 686(8), limited the new trial to the question of
    whether the accused was guilty of murder or manslaughter and foreclosed any
    further litigation on the voluntariness issue. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:

    two decisions referred to above offer direct support for the respondent’s
    contention that the scope of a new trial ordered in this case can be limited
    to the issue of the nature of the respondent’s automatism.  The Crown argues,
    however, that <i>Gorecki</i> and <i>Wade</i> have been implicitly but clearly
    overruled by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Thomas</i> and <i>Warsing</i>.  In <i>Thomas</i>,
    the majority of the court quashed the order of the British Columbia Court
    of Appeal limiting the new trial to the question of whether the accused was
    guilty of murder or manslaughter.  The majority directed a full new trial.  In <i>Warsing</i>,
    the majority reversed the decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal
    limiting the new trial to the issue of the accused’s sanity at the time of
    the homicide.  The court ordered a full new trial.  </p>

    reading of the majority judgments in <i>Thomas</i> and <i>Warsing</i>, in
    combination with the dissents, compels me to agree with the Crown’s submission
    that neither <i>Gorecki</i> nor <i>Wade</i> reflect the present state of
    the law as it relates to s. 686(8).  It does not follow from that observation,
    however, that this court has no jurisdiction to limit the scope of the new
    trial in the circumstances of this appeal.  </p>

    cases in which the orders made by the appellate court limiting the new trial
    effectively eliminated the possibility of an acquittal and restricted, if
    not foreclosed, certain potential defences.  Other authorities relied on
    by the Crown are also cases in which the proposed limits placed on the new
    trial would have adversely affected the rights of the accused: see <i>R.
    v. MacKay</i> (2005), 203 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (S.C.C.); <i>Wells</i>, at para.
    19.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[136]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    accept counsel for the respondent’s submission that the considerations that
    led the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Warsing</i> and <i>Thomas</i> to conclude
    that there was no jurisdiction in s. 686(6) to limit the scope of a new trial
    do not apply where the restriction on the scope of the new trial does not
    disadvantage the accused.  In <i>Warsing</i>, at paras. 72-75, Major J. explained
    that limiting the new trial to the issue of whether the accused was NCR-MD
    was offensive to s. 686(6) because it would deny the accused the presumption
    of innocence and the constitutional right to put forward whatever defence
    the accused deemed appropriate.  In the present case, neither the presumption
    of innocence nor the accused’s right to control his own defence would be
    adversely affected by an order limiting the respondent’s new trial to a determination
    of whether his automatism should lead to an acquittal or an NCR-MD verdict.  To
    the extent that the presumption of innocence remains alive in automatism
    cases after <i>Stone</i>, that presumption is not affected by an order limiting
    the scope of the new trial.  That order would eliminate only the possibility
    of a conviction (although, for reasons set out above, I think the evidence
    as it presently stands effectively eliminates the possibility of an outright
    acquittal).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[137]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    accused supports the order limiting the scope of the new trial.  He does
    not seek to re-litigate the voluntariness issue.  In those circumstances,
    it cannot be said that a limit on the scope of the new trial would interfere
    with the accused’s conduct of his own defence.  To the contrary, the proposed
    order would reflect the manner in which the respondent wishes to conduct
    his defence.  The position of the respondent with respect to the proposed
    limitation on the new trial distinguishes this case from <i>Wade</i>, where
    the accused very much wanted to re-litigate the voluntariness issue that
    he had lost at the initial trial.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[138]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    submissions made on behalf of the respondent have convinced me that s. 686(8)
    does authorize an order ancillary to an order for a new trial made under
    s. 686(4) limiting the scope of the new trial.  That ancillary order may
    be made only where it does not interfere with any of the accused’s rights
    and is otherwise consistent with the demands of justice in the circumstances:
    see <i>R. v. Druken</i> (2002), 164 C.C.C. (3d) 115 (Nfld. C.A.), at pp.
    139-40.  I would think that such orders would be rare.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[139]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Apart
    from the jurisdictional argument, the Crown does not advance any submissions
    to suggest that an order limiting the scope of the respondent’s new trial
    would be unfair to the interests represented by the Crown, cause practical
    problems at the new trial or otherwise interfere with the due administration
    of justice.  The respondent, however, makes a convincing case that it would
    be unfair to compel him to re-litigate the voluntariness issue.  He successfully
    established on the balance of probabilities that his conduct was involuntary.  The
    trial judge fully and fairly reviewed the evidence before making that finding.  His
    review reveals no error.  Forcing a re-litigation of the voluntariness issue
    over the respondent’s objection many years after the relevant events occurred
    would be unfair to the respondent and unlikely to produce either substantive
    or procedural justice.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[140]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    would make an order under s. 686(6) limiting the new trial to whether on
    a proper application of the principles in <i>Stone</i> the respondent’s automatism
    should result in an acquittal or an NCR-MD verdict.  I recognize that in
    limiting the new trial in the manner I have, there may be little independent
    judgment for the trial judge to exercise at the new trial.  If the evidence
    is substantially the same as it was at the first trial, an NCR-MD verdict
    is the only reasonable verdict available from the state of the current law.  I
    would expect the trial judge to reach that verdict, assuming the evidence
    is substantially the same.  The evidence may, of course, be different.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[141]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    is some discussion in counsel’s written submissions about the possibility
    of remitting the matter to the original trial judge for the re-trial.  Section
    686(5)(b) may apply, in which case the re-trial could be before the original
    trial judge only if the court so ordered.  I do not propose to make that
    order at this time.  I do not, however, suggest that there is necessarily
    any impediment to the original trial judge conducting the re-trial.
     If counsel for the parties and the original trial judge are inclined to
    the view that it would be in the best interests of justice for him to conduct
    the re-trial I would be prepared to make the order necessary to remove any
    statutory impediment to him conducting the re-trial.     </p>

    from consideration cases in which the allegedly culpable conduct precedes

    Case Comment” (1993) 72 C.B.R. 224, at p. 237, where the authors make the
    valid point that the courts were prepared to accept that sleepwalking constituted
    non-insane automatism without any expert evidence to that effect because
    it is generally known, even by judges, that individuals are capable of performing
    complicated, apparently purposive acts while asleep.</p>

    assumption in <i>R. v. Burgess</i>, [1991] 2 All. E.R. 769.  The court upheld
    the trial judge’s ruling that automatism caused by parasomnia should result
    in an insanity finding.

    Chief Justice Lane described
    “sleepwalking” as a transitory disorder due to an internal cause which had
    manifested itself in violence and which could reoccur.  These characteristics
    warranted placing parasomnias within the insanity category.  <i>Burgess</i> has
    been the subject of much academic commentary, see <i>e.g.</i> David Cowley, “Sleepwalking
    and Insanity under the McNaghten Rules” (1991) 55 J. Crim. L. 435, and Irene
    MacKay.</p>

    298-99 that the evidence adduced in <i>Parks</i> was quite different that
    the evidence adduced in the English case of <i>Burgess</i>, where sleepwalking
    was characterized as insane automatism.  For a review of some medical opinions
    see Dr. Irshaad Ebrahim, <i>et al</i>., “Violence, Sleepwalking and the Criminal
    Law: (1) The Medical Aspects” (2005) Crim. L. R. 601; and Peter Ridgway.</p>

    recurrence of the triggering events as opposed to the likelihood of the recurrence
    of a violent episode of parasomnia, Bastarache J. relied on an observation
    in the case comment of <i>R.. v. Parks</i> authored by Grant &amp;
    Spitz.  Interestingly, Professor Grant in her analysis of <i>Stone</i> in
    “Developments in Substantive Criminal Law the 1998-99 Term”, at p. 295, states
    that Bastarache J. misunderstood the meaning of her observation in the case
    comment.  </p>
