    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    in 1974 and settled in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Montreal where she worked
    as a chambermaid in

    Queen
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Elizabeth

    for over two decades, before retiring.  She moved to

    Ontario from
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Quebec in 2000 so that
    she could help her daughter care for her grandson.  She lived with her daughter and her family in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Mississauga.  She was 72 years old at the time she moved to
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario, and
    80 years of age at the time of trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant met the appellant at the Church of
    Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Mississauga
    where he served as a <span lang=EN>Melchizedek</span> priest.  The appellant drove her home
    from church on a regular basis.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant gave the appellant $30,000 from a GIC
    and $60,000 from the sale of a condominium that she owned in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Montreal.  She testified that she believed that she gave the appellant the $30,000
    to invest in real estate on her behalf and that she gave him the $60,000 so
    that he could purchase a condominium for her in the “Edinborough” condominium
    complex.  The appellant used most of the
    funds for his personal benefit.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, it was the defence position that the $30,000
    had been given to the appellant to buy shares in his company, and that the
    Crown had failed to prove that the $60,000 had not been invested in the
    Edinborough project.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant made a number of statements at trial
    which were allegedly inconsistent with statements that she made at the
    preliminary hearing.  The impugned
    statements related to her level of literacy, whether she understood there was
    risk in investing in real estate, whether she understood the meaning of the
    word “collateral”, whether the appellant told her that he was a lawyer, and
    whether she had been left penniless as a result of having given the appellant
    the monies in question.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge described the inconsistencies in his
    charge to the jury.  For example, he said
    this in relation to the literacy statements:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>At the preliminary hearing Ms. Archibald testified
    under oath that she could not read or write.  She said at this trial that that was a half truth.  She also said under oath that she was
    illiterate.  At trial she admitted that
    she could read and write.  With respect
    to being illiterate, she admitted she was not telling the truth when she said
    that under oath.  She said she was
    illiterate compared to her children.  She
    also said that if there were words she did not understand she goes to the
    dictionary or to her children to help her out. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After describing the other inconsistencies with a
    similar level of detail, he concluded with the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>These are a few of the inconsistencies for you to
    consider in assessing the credibility and reliability of the evidence of Marita
    Archibald.  If you are satisfied that Ms.
    Archibald testified untruthfully, that should give you some concern in relying
    on her evidence in deciding this case.  To make your decision, use your common sense and experience in assessing
    the evidence of Ms. Archibald.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted of fraud over $5000.  He appeals the conviction on the basis that
    the trial judge failed to properly caution the jury on the dangers of relying
    on the complainant’s testimony.  He
    submits that the charge was inadequate and did not go far enough in warning the
    jury about the dangers of accepting the complainant’s evidence, given how
    crucial her testimony was to the Crown’s case.  He points particularly to the words “should give you some concern”, in arguing
    that the warning was insufficient.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not accept this submission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge provided the jury with instructions on
    the assessment of credibility and reliability of witnesses generally, and on the
    law as it relates to prior inconsistent statements of non-accused witnesses.  He identified and described the
    inconsistencies in the complainant’s testimony and directed the jury on the
    effect of the discrepancies on the complainant’s credibility.  In reviewing the inconsistencies, the trial
    judge included any admissions the complainant had made that she was not telling
    the truth or telling half-truths at the preliminary hearing.  Both of those aspects of the instruction
    distinguish this case from <i>R. v. Sood</i>,
    [1997] O.J. No. 73 (C.A.).  In <i>Sood </i>at paras. 9 and 10, this court identified
    two defects in the charge.  First, only
    two of many inconsistencies in the witness Lamba’s testimony were mentioned and
    the trial judge gave an insufficient review of them.  Second, the trial judge “watered down” the
    significance of the inconsistencies by leaving it to the jury to determine
    whether Lamba had given false evidence at the preliminary hearings when Lamba
    had admitted that he had done so.  As
    mentioned, neither criticism is fairly levelled against the instruction in the
    present case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The authorities are clear that the trial judge has the discretion
    to determine whether the evidence of a witness is untrustworthy to such an
    extent that a warning is necessary: see <i>R.
    v. Bevan </i>(1993), 82 C.C.C. (3d) 82 (S.C.C.).  It was neither necessary nor appropriate in
    the circumstances to provide the jury with a classic <i>Vetrovec</i> warning.  The
    complainant was not an unsavoury witness, she is not disreputable and the
    discrepancies in her evidence do not constitute perjury.  Indeed, defence counsel did not seek a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning <i>per se</i>.  Rather, he asked for
    a “<i>Vetrovec</i>-esque” instruction given
    her “admitted lies under oath”.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the charge was fit and proper given the
    characteristics and testimony of the witness, the nature of the inconsistencies
    and the circumstances of the case.  The
    complainant was subject to comprehensive cross-examination, including rigorous
    cross-examination on each of the alleged inconsistencies.  Whatever discrepancies there were in her
    testimony would have been evident to the jury.  The effect of the instruction was to alert the jury to the need for
    caution in approaching the complainant’s evidence.      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
