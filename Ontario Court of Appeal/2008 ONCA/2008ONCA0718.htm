  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant attacks the constitutionality of
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario’s law banning
    pit bull dogs. As a violation of the law can result in a penalty of
    imprisonment, the appellant invokes the right not to be deprived of “life,
    liberty, and security of the person… except in accordance with the principles
    of fundamental justice” guaranteed by s. 7 of the <i>Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>.  She argues that a total ban is grossly disproportionate to the risk pit
    bulls pose to public safety, rendering the law unconstitutionally overbroad, and
    that the law fails to provide an intelligible definition of pit bulls, rendering
    the law unconstitutionally vague.  She also
    argues that a provision allowing the Crown to introduce as evidence a
    veterinarian’s certificate certifying that the dog is a pit bull violates the right
    to a fair trial and the presumption of innocence, contrary to s. 11(d) of the <i>Charter.</i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In 2005, in the aftermath of a series of highly
    publicized pit bull attacks resulting in serious personal injury to several
    victims, the Ontario Legislature amended the <i>Dog Owners’ Liability Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.&nbsp;D.16 to ban the
    breeding, sale and ownership of pit bull dogs: <i>Public Safety Related to Dogs Statute Law Amendment Act, 2005</i>, S.O.
    2005, c. 2.  The pit bull provisions allow
    those who own pit bulls born at the time the amendments came into force or 60
    days thereafter to keep their dogs (“restricted pit bulls”).  However, owners of restricted pit bulls are
    required by regulation to have their dogs sterilized and to leash and muzzle their
    dogs when in public places. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant owns a “Staffordshire terrier cross” that
    is a restricted pit bull.  In support of
    her overbreadth argument, the appellant submits that the legislature cannot
    justify the law’s total ban on pit bulls and blanket application to all restricted
    pit bulls.  It is her contention that
    there is insufficient evidence to indicate that all pit bulls are inherently dangerous
    and that significantly less drastic measures could satisfy any concern for
    public safety.  In support of her
    vagueness argument, the appellant contends that the Act fails to provide an
    adequate definition of pit bulls and that it is impossible to determine whether
    a dog is or is not caught by the legislation.  Finally, the appellant argues that the
    veterinarian certificate provision denies the right to cross-examine on crucial
    evidence and creates a mandatory evidentiary burden and thereby violates the right
    to a fair trial and the presumption of innocence protected by s. 11(d) of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge rejected the overbreadth
    argument.  She accepted the appellant’s
    vagueness argument but only to a limited extent.  The application judge struck down part of the
    definition of “pit bull” but left the most significant part of the definition
    intact.  She accepted the appellant’s s.
    11(d) argument and struck down the veterinarian certificate provision.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant comes to this court asking us to reverse
    that judgment and to strike down the pit bull provisions as being unconstitutionally
    overbroad and vague.  The Attorney
    General cross-appeals and asks us to restore the definition of “pit bull” as
    enacted by the legislature.  The Attorney
    General also cross-appeals the order striking down the provision relating to
    the use of a veterinarian’s certificate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the following reasons, I conclude that the pit bull
    provisions do not violate any right guaranteed by the <i>Charter</i>.  Accordingly, I would
    dismiss the appeal and allow the cross-appeal.</p>

    restricted pit bull are required to muzzle, leash and sterilize their dogs: <i>Pit Bull Controls,</i> O. Reg. 157/05, ss.
    1-2.  Under s. 18 of the Act, a person
    who contravenes any provision of the Act or regulations is guilty of an offence
    and liable, on conviction, to a fine of up to $10,000, six months imprisonment

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In determining whether a dog is a pit bull
    within the meaning of this Act, a court may have regard to the breed standards
    established for Staffordshire Bull Terriers, American Staffordshire Terriers or
    American Pit Bull Terriers by the Canadian Kennel Club, the United Kennel Club,
    the American Kennel Club or the American Dog Breeders Association. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The provision relating to the admissibility and use of

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>19. (1) A document purporting to be signed by a member of the
    College of Veterinarians of Ontario stating that a dog is a pit bull within the
    meaning of this Act is receivable in evidence in a prosecution for an offence
    under this Act as proof, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the
    dog is a pit bull for the purposes of this Act, without proof of the signature and
    without proof that the signatory is a member of the College.</p>

lang=EN-US>THE APPLICATION JUDGE’S FINDINGS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was conflicting evidence before the application
    judge regarding the dangerousness of pit bulls.  The applicant’s evidence was to the effect
    that pit bulls are not inherently dangerous; that Canadian statistics indicate
    that pit bulls were involved in relatively few reported bites or attacks; and
    that most pit bulls pose no threat to public safety.  The Attorney General relied on evidence of a
    series of pit bull attacks that had resulted in serious personal injury,
    including harm to children; expert evidence that pit bulls tended to be
    unpredictable in their behaviour and susceptible to unprovoked attacks; and
    evidence from the United States indicating that pit bulls were involved in a
    disproportionately high number of serious incidents. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge ruled that the applicant had failed
    to make out a violation of s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i> on grounds of overbreadth.  She held that
    the legislature could act on a “reasoned apprehension of harm” and that conclusive
    evidence that pit bulls pose a threat to public safety was not required so long
    as the legislative response was not “grossly disproportionate” to the
    legislative objective.  She found that it
    was unnecessary to resolve the conflicting evidence as to the danger posed by
    pit bulls and that the record established a sufficient body of evidence to
    permit the legislature to conclude that a total ban on pit bulls was required
    to protect the public.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the vagueness challenge, the
    application judge concluded that, when read as a whole, ss.&nbsp;1(1)(b)-(e)
    and (2) provide a sufficient definition to survive s. 7 scrutiny.  However, she found that as there is no
    recognized “pit bull terrier” breed, the inclusion of “a pit bull terrier” (s.
    1(1)(a)) was unconstitutionally vague.  She also found that the use of the word
    “includes” in the definition of “pit bull” rendered the definition unconstitutionally
    vague.  Accordingly, she struck down the word
    “includes” and s. 1(1)(a) and read into the opening of the definition of “pit
    bull” the word “means” in place of the word “includes”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>With
    respect to s. 19, t</span>he application judge found that a trial judge has the
    discretion to permit cross-examination of the veterinarian and therefore
    rejected the contention that s. 19 violated the accused’s rights to a fair
    trial.  However, the application judge
    also held that s. 19 created a mandatory evidentiary burden that violated the
    right to be presumed innocent guaranteed by s. 11(d) of the <i>Charter</i> and that the violation could not
    be justified as a reasonable limit pursuant to s. 1.  She held that the appropriate remedy was to
    sever s. 19 and to strike it down.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge also rejected the applicant’s

  <h3><i><span
style='font-weight:normal'>Issue 1.           Are
    the pit bull provisions unconstitutionally overbroad?</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Overbreadth is a term used to describe legislation
    that, as drafted, covers more than is necessary to attain the legislature’s
    objective and thereby impinges unduly upon a protected right or freedom.  A law is unconstitutionally overbroad if it
    deprives an individual of “life, liberty and security of the person” in a
    manner that is “grossly disproportionate” to the state interest that the
    legislation seeks to protect.  Such a law
    is said to be “arbitrary” and offends “the principles of fundamental justice”
    and therefore violates s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>.
     A law that restricts the rights
    guaranteed by s. 7 is also “arbitrary” unless it is grounded in a “reasoned
    apprehension of harm”.  The onus of
    proving that the law is “arbitrary” or “grossly disproportionate” lies on the
    applicant: see <i>R. v. Malmo-Levine</i>,
    [2003] 3 S.C.R. 571, at paras. 78, 133, 143.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Attorney General concedes that as the Act provides
    for a potential penalty of imprisonment, the s. 7 right not to be deprived of
    “life, liberty and security of the person… except in accordance with the
    principles of fundamental justice” is implicated.  There is no dispute that the legislative
    purpose of the pit bull provisions is to reduce, and ultimately to eliminate,
    the risk of pit bull attacks in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario.  The appellant concedes that the
    protection of the public from dog bites and dog attacks is a legitimate
    legislative objective.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The contentious issue is whether the appellant

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge carefully reviewed and analyzed
    this evidence and concluded as follows, at paras. 74, 79 and 84 of her reasons
    on the constitutional challenge:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]here is inconclusive and competing
    evidence in the case at hand.  However,
    conclusive evidence is not required before a government can take action. It is
    also not necessary for the court to resolve the conflicting evidence.  There is, in my opinion, sufficient evidence
    to conclude that the legislature, in enacting these provisions, had a “reasoned
    apprehension of harm” concerning the dangerousness of pit bulls.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:
center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is my opinion that,
    in the face of this conflicting evidence, the legislature was entitled to decide
    that there was a sufficient body of evidence with respect to the inability to
    identify dangerous pit bulls in advance of an attack so as to justify
    restrictions that apply to all pit bulls. The recommended alternative
    approaches to breed-specific legislation largely depend on either a previous
    dangerous act or a responsible dog owner identifying a dangerous dog and taking
    appropriate action.  Where public safety
    is concerned, it was open to the legislature to choose the more cautious
    approach.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:
center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is not my task to substitute my opinion for that
    of the legislature as to how best to protect the public.  It is also not necessary for me to resolve the
    conflicting evidence as to the role that breed plays in determining whether a
    dog is dangerous and whether pit bulls, as a breed, are dangerous. The
    legislature, in determining how to accomplish its objective, is not required to
    have conclusive evidence before it enacts legislation.  The evidence with respect to the dangerousness
    of pit bulls, although conflicting and inconclusive, is sufficient, in my
    opinion, to constitute a “reasoned apprehension of harm”.  In the face of conflicting evidence as to the
    feasibility of less restrictive means to protect the public, it was open to the
    legislature to decide to restrict the ownership of all pit bulls.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the application judge erred
    by refusing to make findings of fact and by failing to resolve the conflicting
    evidence.  The appellant submits that the
    application judge was required to decide whether pit bulls are in fact
    inherently dangerous and whether a total ban on pit bulls was required to meet the
    legislature’s concerns in relation to public safety.  Without making such findings, the appellant
    submits, the application judge was not in a position to dismiss the overbreadth
    challenge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I disagree with the appellant’s submissions and see no
    error in the approach taken by the application judge.  In my view, the appellant’s submission
    misstates – and significantly understates – the burden that rests upon a
    claimant who challenges a law under s. 7 on grounds of overbreadth.  As I have stated, the test for a breach of s.
    7 on grounds of overbreadth is whether the law is “arbitrary” because there is
    no “reasoned apprehension of harm” or whether the law is “grossly
    disproportionate” to the legislative objective.  To meet that test, the appellant had to
    satisfy the onus of demonstrating that the legislature did not have a basis for
    a “reasoned apprehension of harm” from pit bulls or that the action taken by the
    legislature was “grossly disproportionate” to the risk posed by pit bulls.
    Fairly read, the reasons of the application judge indicate that she quite
    properly focussed her analysis on these issues.  In my view, the record amply supports the
    application judge’s conclusion that the appellant failed to satisfy the onus of
    demonstrating a breach of s. 7 on grounds of overbreadth.</p>

    harm or the efficaciousness of Parliament’s remedy is difficult or impossible
    to measure scientifically it is for the legislature, not the courts, to decide
    upon the appropriate course of action, provided there is evidence of a
    “reasoned apprehension of harm”.  It was
    not the role of the application judge to make detailed factual findings as that
    would lead to “micromanagement of Parliament’s agenda”.  Her task was rather to apply the “relevant
    constitutional control”; namely, “the general principle that the parliamentary
    response must not be grossly disproportionate to the state interest sought to
    be protected”: see <i>Malmo-Levine</i>, at para.

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Supreme Court of Canada has consistently held that
    the “legislature is not required to provide scientific proof based on concrete
    evidence of the problem it seeks to address in every case” and that in the
    absence of “determinative scientific evidence” it is appropriate for the court
    to rely “on logic, reason and some social science evidence” to determine
    whether there is “a reasoned apprehension of that harm”: see <i>Harper v. Canada (A.G.)</i>, [2004] 1 S.C.R.

    standard of proof than the subject matter admits of” and that as “some studies”
    linked child pornography to the incitement of offences, a “reasoned
    apprehension of harm” was made out.  Similarly,

    at pp. 502-503, another case dealing with disputed evidence regarding the
    effects of pornography, Sopinka J. assessed the evidence as being
    “inconclusive” but, applying <i>Irwin Toy
    Ltd. v. Quebec (A.G.),</i> [1989] 1 S.C.R. 927, at p. 990, recognized that the

    appellant’s submission that this reasoning applies only at the minimal
    impairment stage of s. 1 and that the application judge erred by applying it to
    determine whether there had been a violation of s. 7 on account of overbreadth.
     First, as a matter of authority, the
    Supreme Court of Canada appears to have assimilated the minimal impairment
    analysis under s. 1 with the overbreadth analysis under s. 7: see <i>e.g.</i> <i>R.
    v. Clay,</i> [2003] 3 S.C.R. 735, at para. 35; <i>R. v.

    see why the determination of whether legislation is overbroad and therefore in
    violation of s. 7 should involve a <i>more</i> stringent test than the test to determine whether minimal impairment has been
    satisfied.  The s. 1 minimal impairment
    test only comes into play when the government is attempting to justify an
    infringement of <i>Charter</i> rights.  If anything, one would expect the test to be <i>more</i> stringent where the claimant has
    demonstrated a <i>Charter</i> breach and the

    a law is “grossly disproportionate” to the legislative objective, one must

    application judge correctly observed, the right to own a dog is not protected
    by the <i>Charter</i>.  The applicant is able to invoke s. 7 only
    because of the possibility that a court might impose a penalty of imprisonment
    for violation of the Act, an unlikely prospect absent blameworthy conduct by an
    owner leading to personal injury.  This
    possibility of imprisonment must be weighed against the risk that pit bulls
    pose to public safety.  The test of gross
    disproportionality clearly incorporates a substantial measure of deference to
    the legislature’s assessment of the risk to public safety and the need for the
    impugned law: <i>R. v. Heywood</i>, [1994] 3

    reasons of the application judge demonstrate an entirely appropriate and
    defensible analysis and weighing of these competing factors.  At para. 86 of her reasons, she states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>When one considers the interests at
    stake, that is, the objective of public safety as against the restrictions on
    dog owners, it is my opinion that this was a choice that the legislators were
    entitled to make. I conclude, therefore, that the means the legislature has
    chosen are not too sweeping in relation to the objective and the provisions are
    not unconstitutionally overbroad.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I also agree with the application judge’s conclusion
    that the total ban on pit bulls is not “arbitrary” or “grossly
    disproportionate” in light of the evidence that pit bulls have a tendency to be
    unpredictable and that even apparently docile pit bulls may attack without warning
    or provocation.  This evidence of
    unpredictability provided the legislature with a sufficient basis to conclude
    that the protection of public safety required no less drastic measures than a
    total ban on pit bulls. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with the Attorney General’s submission that the <i>Charter</i> does not require an individual
    assessment of each dog before it can be required to wear a leash or muzzle.  Evidence of the unpredictable risk of severe
    harm is sufficient to allow the legislature reasonably to conclude that pit
    bulls as a group are dangerous because of the risk they pose.  Legislatures frequently enact blanket
    prohibitions on things or activities that may be used or conducted safely because
    of the risk that severe harm can result from misuse or misconduct.  The prohibition and regulation of certain
    firearms provides an example. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The legislature’s response to the problem posed by pit
    bulls is not analogous to the legislative responses in the cases relied upon by
    the appellant.  In <i>Heywood</i>,<i> </i>and <i>R. v. Demers</i>, [2004] S.C.R. 489, the
    impugned laws directly impinged upon the claimants’ liberty interest in a
    manner more significant than the pit bull provisions.  Furthermore, in those cases, there existed
    adequate and less drastic measures capable of protecting public safety.  In <i>Heywood</i>,
    the impugned law provided a lifetime ban on sex offenders from frequenting all
    public parks and bathing areas.  The court
    found that the risk of harm could be satisfied by limiting the ban to parks
    frequented by children and reviewing the need to continue the order from time
    to time.  In <i>Demers</i>, all permanently unfit accused, including persons who were not
    a significant threat to the public, were consigned to indefinite assessment and
    review with no possibility of trial or discharge.  The court concluded that indefinite
    incarceration of such individuals could not be justified.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Vagueness describes a lack of precision in legislation
    that leaves its meaning and application unacceptably uncertain.  Legislation should provide fair notice to
    citizens as to what conduct is prohibited, appropriate limits on the discretion
    of law enforcement officials and a proper basis for coherent judicial
    interpretation.  A law that implicates
    the s. 7 right to life, liberty and security of the person will be struck down
    as being inconsistent with the principles of fundamental justice if it is not
    sufficiently intelligible to meet these objectives. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the other hand, certainty is not the standard and
    legislation is not unconstitutionally vague simply because it is subject to
    interpretation.  As the Supreme Court of
    Canada held in <i>Nova Scotia Pharmaceutical
    Society</i>, at pp. 638-39:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Legal rules only provide a framework, a
    guide as to how one may behave, but certainty is only reached in instant cases,
    where law is actualized by a competent authority.&nbsp; In the meanwhile,
    conduct is guided by approximation.&nbsp; The process of approximation
    sometimes results in quite a narrow set of options, sometimes in a broader
    one.&nbsp; Legal dispositions therefore delineate a risk zone, and cannot hope
    to do more, unless they are directed at individual instances.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Language is not the exact tool some may think it
    is. It cannot be argued that an enactment can and must provide enough guidance
    to predict the legal consequences of any given course of conduct in advance.  All it can do is enunciate some boundaries,
    which create an area of risk. But it is inherent to our legal system that some
    conduct will fall along the boundaries of the area of risk; no definite
    prediction can then be made.  Guidance,
    not direction, of conduct is a more realistic objective. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is sufficient for the law to delineate an area of

    definition of “pit bull” in ss. 1(1)(b)-(e) and 1(2) sufficiently delineates an
    area of risk and provides a basis for intelligible debate and interpretation.  The core of the definition is the reference in
    ss. 1(1)(b)-(d) to the three named breeds that have defined physical
    characteristics that are accepted by kennel clubs and dog breeder
    associations.  That well-defined core is
    not exhaustive, but it provides a point of reference that identifies the
    essential physical characteristics for pit bulls.  The phrase “substantially similar” is commonly
    used in statutes to embrace a somewhat broader class than that captured by an enumerated
    list of referents.  To the extent that the
    definition of “pit bull” extends beyond the specified breeds, the substantially
    similar clause is capable of controlling or limiting the reach of the law
    within constitutionally acceptable limits. </p>

    standards “provide guidance to dog owners and others to assist them in determining
    whether a particular dog falls within the definition.”  While s. 1(2) permits rather than mandates
    reference to breed standards, the application judge correctly observed at para.
    177 that the court “is required to exhaust its interpretative function before
    it can be said that a law is vague.”  I
    agree with her conclusion at para. 177 that the reference to the identified
    breeds “provides an interpretive guide and is sufficient… to provide the
    necessary guidance or benchmarks.”</p>

    that a higher degree of precision is required for a law to survive s. 7
    vagueness scrutiny than is warranted by the case law.  As the Attorney General points out in its
    factum, the Supreme Court of Canada has upheld a long list of laws that are

    have sufficient precision to survive s. 7 scrutiny.  In these and other areas of social or
    regulatory policy, the fact that identification and classification does not
    lend itself to linguistic certainty will not defeat laws which provide a degree
    of clarity capable of supporting intelligible debate.  In my view, given the nature of the

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I turn now to the issue raised by the Attorney
    General’s cross-appeal: did the application judge err in holding that the word
    “includes” in the opening of s. 1(1) and the inclusion of the phrase “a pit
    bull terrier” in s. 1(1)(a) render the definition of “pit bull”
    unconstitutionally vague?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge held that it should be presumed
    that by adding the phrase “a pit bull terrier”, the legislature must have meant
    to add something to the definition not captured by the balance of s. 1.  She found that there is no recognized breed of
    pit bull terrier and no agreement among the experts as to what dogs are or are
    not pit bull terriers.  At para. 185 of
    her reasons, she concluded as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]he phrases “pit bull includes” and “pit
    bull terriers” are problematic in so far as they appear to include an undefined
    number of dogs that fall beyond the three specified breeds and dogs
    substantially similar to those three breeds.  In so far as these terms go beyond the three
    breeds, they do not, in my opinion, provide sufficient guidance to courts or to
    those who have to enforce the legislation. They also do not define an “area of
    risk” for dog owners.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the following reasons, I respectfully disagree with
    this conclusion. In my opinion, the definition of “pit bull” as enacted by the
    legislature survives s. 7 vagueness scrutiny.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is ample evidence in the record to demonstrate
    that the terms “pit bull” and “pit bull terrier” are generic, dictionary terms
    commonly used by members of the public, scholars, veterinarians, animal control
    officers and humane societies to describe American Staffordshire terriers,
    American pit bull terriers, Staffordshire bull terriers, and dogs that are
    hybrids or mixes of these breeds or that have substantially similar
    characteristics.  The terms “pit bull”
    and “pit bull terrier” are found in many of the articles and the professional
    literature cited in the record as well as in the testimony of most of the
    witnesses.  The <i>Canadian Oxford Dictionary</i>, 2001 ed., defines a “pit bull” or “pit
    bull terrier” as “a dog of an American variety of bull terrier, noted for its
    ferocity”.   The legislature cannot be
    faulted for using vernacular or generic terms to alert the public to the nature
    of a prohibition also described in more precise scientific or technical
    language: <i>Canadian Pacific</i>, at para.
    53.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The terms “pit bull” and “pit bull terrier” must also be
    read in their context as elements of a more comprehensive definition.  I do not agree with the application judge that
    by enacting the phrase “pit bull includes” and including the phrase “a pit bull
    terrier”, the legislature must have intended to add to the reach of the definition
    of “pit bull” to include a broader class than captured by ss. 1(1)(b)-(e).  Legislatures commonly use repetitive and
    redundant language, repeating commonly used synonymous words out of an
    abundance of caution to ensure that the terms of a statute are given a
    compendious meaning.  The test for
    vagueness is unintelligibility, not redundancy, and the inclusion of repetitive
    language does not render the definition constitutionally infirm.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, the word “includes” does not necessarily
    require an expansive interpretation extending the definition beyond the
    itemized list contained in ss. 1(1)(a)-(e). <span> </span>The word “includes” “may… depending
    on the context, precede a list that exhausts the definition”: <i>Re Canada 3000 Inc</i>. <i>(Re)</i>, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 865, at para. 47.  Where possible, legislation should be
    interpreted in a manner that corresponds to constitutional rights and values.  To the extent the word “includes” is
    susceptible of importing an unacceptably vague definition, giving it narrow import
    as exhausting the definition is preferable to striking it down.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I would allow this part of the
    cross-appeal, set aside paragraph 1 of the judgment and restore s. 1 as enacted.</p>
  <h3><i><span style='color:black;font-weight:normal'>Issue
    3.           Does s. 19, providing for
    proof that the dog is a pit bull through a veterinarian’s certificate, violate
    s. 11(d) of the Charter?</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before the application judge, the appellant made two
    arguments in relation to s.&nbsp;19:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i)     the lack of a provision for
    cross-examination in respect of the document from the veterinarian contravenes
    the right to a fair trial guaranteed by s. 11(d) of the <i>Charter</i>, and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii)    the fact that
    the document is proof that the dog is a pit bull, in the absence of evidence to
    the contrary, infringes the defendant's right to be presumed innocent contrary
    to s. 11(d) of the <i>Charter.</i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the first issue, the application judge concluded
    that ss. 39 and 46 of the <i>Provincial
    Offences Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.33 give trial judges a discretion to allow
    for cross-examination of the veterinarian who signed the certificate.  She held at para. 215 of her reasons that “it
    should be assumed that the discretion of the court to give leave to a defendant
    to cross-examine will be exercised in a way that is consistent with <i>Charter </i>rights and, in particular, with
    the right to trial fairness and the due administration of justice.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree.  This
    ruling, from which no appeal was taken, is a full answer to the appellant’s
    first ground of attack on s.19.  A trial
    judge’s discretion to permit cross-examination of the veterinarian is an
    important safeguard of an accused’s s. 11(d) rights. There is no reason to
    suppose that leave to cross-examine, if sought, will be improperly or lightly
    denied.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On the second issue, the application judge
    concluded that by providing for proof by veterinarian’s certificate, s. 19
    creates a mandatory evidentiary presumption that violates the s. 11(d) <i>Charter </i>right “to be presumed innocent
    until proven guilty”.  The Attorney
    General cross-appeals on this issue.  For
    the following reasons, I conclude that, properly interpreted, s. 19 does not create
    a situation where the accused is liable to be convicted in spite of a
    reasonable doubt and therefore does not violate the right to be presumed
    innocent until proven guilty.  I would
    therefore allow the Attorney General’s cross-appeal on this issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I read s. 19, it simply provides that as proof of
    the fact that a dog falls within the definition of “pit bull”, the Crown may
    introduce a certificate to that effect purporting to be signed by a member of
    the
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    College of
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Veterinarians
    of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario.  Despite the rather complicated wording of s.
    19, in the end, when properly interpreted, its legal effect is to overcome the
    effect of the hearsay evidence rule that would make a veterinarian’s
    certificate inadmissible.  Allowing for
    proof by way of veterinarian’s certificate does not create a presumption, nor does
    it violate the presumption of innocence.  Rather, s. 19 is an enabling provision that merely affords the
    prosecution a more expedient method of proving a fact necessary to sustain a
    conviction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R. v. Downey</i>,
    [1992] 2 S.C.R. 10, at p. 21, Cory J. referred to the landmark case of <i>R. v. Oakes</i> [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103, at p.
    115, where Dickson C.J. identified two types of presumptions:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Presumptions can be classified into two general
    categories: presumptions <u>without</u> basic facts and presumptions <u>with</u> basic facts. A presumption without a basic fact is simply a conclusion which is
    to be drawn until the contrary is proved. A presumption with a basic fact
    entails a conclusion to be drawn upon proof of the basic fact. [Citations
    omitted.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Presumptions <i>without</i> basic facts are the legal starting point for the determination of a factual
    issue.  Presumptions without basic facts
    relate to placement of the legal or evidentiary burden of proof as a matter of
    law.  The presumption of innocence is the
    classic example.  Until the Crown proves
    the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt, the accused is presumed to
    be innocent. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Presumptions <i>with</i> basic facts operate by either permitting (a permissive presumption) or
    requiring (a mandatory presumption) the trier of fact to find the presumed fact
    upon proof of some other “basic fact”.  For
    example, the provision in the <i>Narcotics
    Control Act</i> at issue in <i>Oakes</i> required the trier of fact to find an intention to traffic drugs (the presumed
    fact) upon proof of possession of drugs (the basic fact).  Similarly, the provision at issue in
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Downey</i> involved a presumption from basic facts: s.&nbsp;212(3) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> provided that “[e]vidence
    that a person lives with or is habitually in the company of prostitutes… is, in
    the absence of evidence to the contrary, proof that the person lives on the
    avails of prostitution”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <i>Downey</i> and <i>Oakes</i> make clear, the focus for inquiry
    in relation to the presumption of innocence guaranteed by s. 11(d) is this:
    does the legislative provision create a situation where the accused is liable
    to be convicted despite the existence of a reasonable doubt?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>In
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    <i>Downey</i>,
    Cory J. explained at p. 29 how this concern may or may not arise in the case of
    presumptions <i>with </i>basic facts:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Legislation which substitutes proof of one element
    for proof of an essential element will not infringe the presumption of
    innocence if as a result of the proof of the substituted element, it would be
    unreasonable for the trier of fact not to be satisfied beyond a reasonable
    doubt of the existence of the other element.  To put it another way, the statutory presumption will be valid if the
    proof of the substituted fact leads inexorably to the proof of the other.  However, the statutory presumption will
    infringe s. 11(d) if it requires the trier of fact to convict in spite of a
    reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, in <i>Oakes</i>,<i> </i>proof of possession of drugs did not
    lead inexorably to proof of an intention to traffic drugs.  Similarly, in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    <i>Downey</i>,
    proof that the accused lived with prostitutes did not lead inexorably to proof
    that the accused was living off the avails of prostitution.  In both cases, the accused were liable to be convicted
    in spite of a reasonable doubt as to their guilt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Does s. 19 create a situation where the accused is
    liable to be convicted in spite of a reasonable doubt, either through the
    existence of a basic fact presumption or otherwise?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is clear that s. 19 does not fall into the category
    of presumptions with basic facts.  The
    veterinarian’s certificate does not prove a basic fact from which the trier of
    fact may or must find the presumed fact, <i>i.e.</i> that the dog is a pit bull.  The
    certificate is direct evidence of that fact and its evidentiary force does not depend
    upon any presumption.  Section 19 of the
    Act simply renders the certificate admissible and capable of being used by the
    trier of fact as <i>direct</i> evidence of
    the dog’s breed, not as proof of some other fact that in turn allows or
    requires the trier of fact to presume the dog’s breed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Could s. 19 nonetheless give rise to a conviction in
    spite of a reasonable doubt?  By
    providing that the veterinarian’s certificate is “proof, in the absence of
    evidence to the contrary”, s. 19(1) is, on its face, perhaps suggestive of a
    reverse onus.  However, in the end, I am
    not persuaded that it has that effect.  The
    provision at issue in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <i>Downey</i> used
    similar language.  However,
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <i>Downey</i> dealt with a presumption <i>with</i> a basic
    fact which clearly gave rise to the possibility of conviction in spite of a
    reasonable doubt.  Section 19 does not
    operate by creating a presumption from a basic fact.  As the appellant candidly acknowledged during
    oral argument, s. 19 is not analogous to the statutory provision at issue in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <i>Downey</i>.  It follows that the reasoning in
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Downey</i> is therefore distinguishable.  Moreover,
    s. 19(3) explicitly preserves the presumption of innocence and requires the
    Crown to prove the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Once the Crown relies on s. 19 to introduce a
    veterinarian’s certificate that a dog is a pit bull, it is true that the
    accused risks being convicted unless he or she offers something, either through
    cross-examination of the veterinarian or by adducing other evidence, to suggest
    that the dog is not a pit bull.  <span
style='color:black'>The certificate creates a situation where the accused faces
    a tactical burden to point to some evidence capable of raising a reasonable
    doubt as to the dog’s breed.  </span>But
    to the extent that s. 19 thereby creates what may be described as an evidentiary
    burden, I do not agree that it violates the presumption of innocence.  It is simply the tactical burden that any
    accused faces once the Crown makes out a <i>prima
    facie</i> case on an essential element of the offence.  <span style='color:black'>Unanswered – for the
    certificate is only “proof” that the dog is a pit bull when it is unanswered –
    the certificate is proof that the dog is a pit bull.  The provision that the certificate is “proof,
    in the absence of evidence to the contrary” in this context amounts to a statement
    of the obvious rather than a legal prescription altering the burden of proof.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, to remove any doubt on the matter, I repeat that
    s. 19(3) explicitly preserves the presumption of innocence, providing that “this
    section does not remove the onus on the prosecution to prove its case beyond a
    reasonable doubt.”  Nothing in s. 19
    relieves against the Crown’s obligation to prove all elements of an offence

    s. 11(d) of the <i>Charter</i> and I would
    therefore set aside paragraph 2 of the judgment striking down s. 19.</p>
  <h3><i><span style='color:black;font-weight:normal'>Issue

    of the Charter, are they justified pursuant to s.&nbsp;1?</span></i></h3>

    5.           To the extent that the pit
    bull provisions are unconstitutionally vague, is severance and reading in the
    appropriate remedy?</span></i></h3>
  <h3><i><span style='color:black;font-weight:normal'>Issue
    6.           Did the</span></i><i><span style='color:black'> </span></i><i><span style='color:black;font-weight:normal'>application

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I have concluded that there is no <i>Charter </i>breach, and that the appeal should
    be dismissed and cross-appeal allowed, it is not necessary for me to consider
    the issues of s. 1 justification, the appropriate remedy or the application
    judge’s disposition as to costs.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal and allow
    the cross-appeal, set aside paragraphs 1 and 2 of the judgment below and
    dismiss the application.  If the parties
    are unable to agree as to costs, we will receive brief written submissions to
    be provided by the Attorney General within ten days of the release of these
    reasons and by the appellant within five days thereafter. </p>
