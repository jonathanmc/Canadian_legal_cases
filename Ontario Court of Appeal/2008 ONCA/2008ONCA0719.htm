    Appeals Tribunal (the “Tribunal”) from the decision of the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court (<i>per</i> Lederman J., Jennings J. concurring, Swinton J.
    dissenting).  The Tribunal decided that
    contributions to the respondent Mr. Rodrigues’ benefit plan were not “earnings”
    as defined in s. 2 of the <i>Workplace
    Safety and Insurance Act</i>, 1997, S.O. 1997, c. 16 (“<i>WSIA”)</i>, and were, therefore, excluded from the calculation of the
    respondent’s loss of earnings benefits.  The
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court
    quashed the Tribunal’s decision and remitted the matter back to it.  A majority of the Divisional Court held that
    the Tribunal had committed an error of law rendering its decision patently
    unreasonable because it failed to refer to the legislative history of
    amendments to the definition of earnings in the section of the former <i>Workers’ Compensation Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990,
    c.W.11 that is now s. 2 of the <i>WSIA.</i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issue in this appeal is whether the majority of the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court
    erred in holding that the Tribunal’s failure to expressly consider evidence of
    legislative history constituted “legal error” depriving the Tribunal’s decision
    of deference.  As I will explain, the
    majority of the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court
    erred and the dissenting reasons of Swinton J. are correct.</p>
  <h2 style='line-height:normal'>II</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent worker suffered an injury as a result of
    an accident that occurred while he was working at Highgate Metal Erectors
    Ltd.  The respondent applied to the
    Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (“Board”) for benefits, which are
    calculated in relation to a worker’s earnings.  After he was awarded certain benefits by the Board, the respondent
    appealed to the Tribunal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The issue in dispute before the Board, and later the
    Tribunal, concerned the size of “loss of earnings” benefits to be given to the
    worker.  The respondent worker was
    entitled to a percentage of his pre-accident earnings.  The greater the earnings, the greater the
    benefits.  The question was whether the
    worker’s employer’s contributions to his health, welfare and pension employment
    benefits should be included when calculating the worker’s pre-accident
    earnings.  The respondent contended that
    the contributions were earnings under s. 2 of the <i>WSIA</i>.  The Board and the
    Tribunal disagreed.</p>
  <h2 style='line-height:normal'>III</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Board was the first body to consider the issue in
    dispute.  The <i>WSIA</i> requires that the Board calculate a worker’s pre-accident
    earnings for the purposes of determining loss of earnings claims.  This requires that the Board determine, <i>inter alia</i>, whether an employer’s
    contributions to a worker’s health, welfare and pension employment benefits
    should be included when calculating the worker’s pre-accident earnings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 2(1) of the Act defines “earnings” as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>“earnings” or “wages” include any remuneration
    capable of being estimated in terms of money but does not include contributions
    made under section 25 for employment benefits.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Sections 126(1) of the Act
    reads:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If there is an applicable Board policy with respect
    to the subject matter of an appeal, the Appeals Tribunal <i>shall</i> apply it when making its decision. [Emphasis added].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Section 126(4)
    provides that if the Tribunal concludes that a Board policy is inconsistent
    with, or not authorized by the Act, it shall not make a decision until it
    refers the policy to the Board for review and the Board issues a direction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, the Board has published a written policy
    concerning the meaning of “earnings” for the purpose of a determination of
    “average earnings” under s. 53 of the Act, which requires the Board to
    determine the amount of a worker’s average earnings for the purposes of the
    insurance plan.  The policy, which is
    Operational Policy 4.1, includes a comprehensive list of the kind of employer
    contributions to be included as employee “earnings”.  The comprehensive list does not include the
    employer’s contribution to the worker’s health, welfare and pension benefits.  The respondent did not challenge the
    Operational Policy before the Tribunal, the Divisional court or this court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first administrative decision was made by a Board
    Claims Adjudicator.  He ruled that the
    Board provide the respondent with partial loss of earnings benefits, and
    calculated the worker’s pre-accident gross earnings as $735.79 per week.  The respondent, who was represented by a
    union representative, asked the Claims Adjudicator to recalculate his
    pre-accident earnings to include the employer’s contributions to his health,
    welfare and pension benefits.  The Claims
    Adjudicator said the contributions were not to be included when calculating
    pre-accident earnings.  The worker
    appealed this decision to the Board’s Appeals Resolution Office.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A Board Appeal Resolution Officer denied the worker’s
    appeal.  The officer considered the
    submission of the worker’s union representative, the Act and the Board’s
    operational policies.  The officer
    decided that “the applicable legislation and policy is [<i>sic</i>] clear” and that “contributions for employment benefits are
    excluded” from the calculation of pre-accident net average earnings.  Mr. Rodrigues appealed this decision to the
    Tribunal.</p>
  <h2 style='line-height:normal'>IV</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Tribunal is the final appellate forum in matters of
    workplace safety and insurance in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario.  Its decisions are subject to a strongly
    worded privative clause in ss. 5 and 123(4) of the Act.  As a tribunal is quite different from a
    court, tribunal members play a role more active than a judge, and frequently
    apply their own expertise in deciding issues before the Tribunal.  The Tribunal releases thousands of decisions
    each year concerning employees’ pre-accident earnings.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I have indicated, s. 126(1) of the Act requires that
    if there is an applicable Board policy with respect to the subject of an
    appeal, the Board is bound to apply the policy when making its decision.  Thus, the Tribunal had no choice but to apply
    the Board’s Operational Policy 4.1 to this case.  It makes no reference to an employer’s
    contributions to a worker’s health, welfare and pension benefits as being included
    in “earnings”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An experienced Tribunal Vice-Chair decided this case in
    a careful and comprehensive manner.  Her
    thorough reasons required 151 paragraphs.  When the Tribunal became concerned that it did not have enough factual
    information to decide the issue, if requested additional evidence or
    submissions from several sources.  The
    Tribunal reached its decision by considering the worker’s evidence and
    submissions, all of the evidence in the record, including the Board’s claim
    file, and the addition submissions and evidence that it had requested.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Tribunal also reviewed the Act in the course of its
    reasons.  It noted that s. 126(1) of the
    Act required that it apply the Board’s Operational Policy 4.1.  It concluded that the employment benefits
    pension plan contributions made by the employer was not in a list set out in
    Operational Policy 4.1 of matters considered to be “earnings”.  Therefore, in accordance with s. 126(1), as
    it was legally obligated to do, the Tribunal applied Operational Policy 4.1 and
    held that the employer’s contributions were not “earnings” under s. 2(1) of the
    Act.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, this would have been a sufficient rational
    basis for the Tribunal to find that employer’s contributions should not be
    included in the worker’s “earnings”.  However, the Tribunal went further and provided five additional rational
    bases for its decision:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Tribunal noted the existence of prior Tribunal
    decisions on virtually identical facts that had found that employers’
    contributions to the same plans were not “earnings” under s. 2 of the Act.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The employer’s payments were not made to the worker in
    lieu of benefits.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The employer’s payments were not direct payments to the
    worker.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The list of matters considered earnings in Operational
    Policy 4.1 were all taxable, while the contributions made by the employer were
    not taxable.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(5)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a matter of policy, the Tribunal stated that the
    inclusion of such employer contributions as earnings would have a significant
    impact on the overall workplace safety and insurance system.</p>
  <h2 style='line-height:normal'>V</h2>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The majority reasons of the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court begin with the
    recognition that the issue before the Tribunal was whether the respondent’s
    pre-injury earnings should be calculated to include his employer’s
    contributions to the health and welfare plan and the pension plan of his
    union.  After reviewing the background
    facts, at para. 8 Lederman J. correctly stated the applicable standard of
    review:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            Given
    the applicable standard of review of the decision of the Vice-Chair of the
    WSIAT, which all parties agree upon as being one of patent unreasonableness,
    the sole question is whether or not the WSIAT’s decision that these
    contributions should not be included in the applicant’s pre-accident earnings
    was so irrational as to be patently unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the Supreme Court of
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    in <i>Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick</i>, 2008 SCC 9
    collapsed the patent unreasonableness and <i>simpliciter</i> standard of review into a single form of an unreasonableness standard, the
    Supreme Court appears to say that it is not necessary to engage in a fresh
    standard of review analysis in decisions made before <i>Dunsmuir</i>.  This would mean
    that the standard of review in this case would remain patent
    unreasonableness.  However, without
    reference to whether the “old” or the “new” standard of review should apply, in
    four post-<i>Dunsmuir</i> decisions, this
    court has accepted the <i>Dunsmuir</i> unreasonableness standard and did not analyze the case on the basis of the pre-<i>Dunsmuir</i> standard of review: <i>Canadian General-Tower Ltd. v. United Steel,
    Paper &amp; Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial &amp;
    Service Workers International Union Local 862</i> (2008), 238 O.A.C. 50; <i>Flora v. Ontario (Health Insurance Plan,
    General Manager)</i> (2008), 238 O.A.C. 319; <i>Mulligan v. Laurentian University</i>, [2008] O.J. No. 2570; <i>Mills v. Ontario (Workplace Safety &amp;
    Insurance Appeals Tribunal)</i> (2008), 237 71. Whether the standard of review
    is patent unreasonableness or unreasonableness, existing jurisprudence shows
    that reviewing courts can interfere only where in the ease of patent
    unreasonableness where the Tribunal’s decision is “clearly irrational”, and in
    the case of unreasonableness where the decision does not fall within a range of
    possible, acceptable outcomes.  To
    interfere, the reviewing court must find that there are no lines of reasoning
    supporting the decision that could have reasonably led the tribunal to reach
    the decision that it did.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The majority of the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court then considered the reasons
    of the Tribunal, noting that the Tribunal stated that it was required to apply
    Operational Policy 4.1.  It then
    extensively reviewed the legislative history of the relevant legislation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The majority stated that the legislative history was in
    evidence before the Tribunal, but no consideration was given to it by the
    Vice-Chair in her reasons or analysis.  In paras. 29, 30 and 31, the majority concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>What is striking in this case is the total failure
    by either the WSIB or the WSIAT to take the legislative history and the
    government’s explanatory purpose into account in any way.  The Vice-Chair was engaged in an exercise of
    statutory interpretation and she considered a variety of factors in determining
    the purpose of the statutory provision and the nature of the legislature’s
    intention.  She specifically found that
    it could not have been the legislature’s intention to turn the employment
    contributions into non-taxable pre-accident earnings or intended the result of
    the legislation to be that workers would receive non-taxable earnings.  Having considered a multitude of factors with
    respect to legislative purpose and intention, she also should have weighed the
    evidence of the government’s explanatory purpose which on its face makes it
    clear that the definition of earnings would not exclude the contribution for
    employment benefits at issue in this case.  That is not to say that had the legislative history and purpose been
    considered, the Vice-Chair might not have found it determinative and given it
    less weight in comparison to the other factors that she did consider.  She erred in ignoring the stated purpose
    altogether, particularly since it plainly suggests an interpretation opposite
    to the conclusion at which she arrived.  The failure to consider it, as it was evidence before her, and to assess
    its overall weight in the context of the factual and legal matrix is a legal
    error which deprives the decision of deference.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Accordingly, in these circumstance, I must conclude
    that the failure to consider relevant evidence that might have had a
    significant impact on the Vice-Chair’s findings renders her decision patently
    unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Therefore, the decision of the Vice-Chair of the
    WSIAT is set aside and the matter is remitted back for a re-hearing in
    accordance with these reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In her dissenting reasons, Swinton J. would have upheld
    the Tribunal’s decision on the ground that it was rationally supportable.  In my view, she is correct.  She noted that “the Tribunal’s task was to
    determine the meaning of ‘earnings’ in light of the language used in the Act
    and policy considerations, as well as evidence about the nature of the actual
    benefit payments”, which it discharged by undertaking “extensive investigation
    to obtain relevant evidence on earnings” and by making “a decision that is
    squarely within the Tribunal’s specialized expertise” and “consistent with an
    earlier case with similar facts”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As for legislative history, Swinton J, found that the
    Tribunal’s failure to refer to evidence of legislative history did not deprive
    the Tribunal of being accorded deference, or render its decision patently
    unreasonable.  Moreover, legislative
    history was not the focus of the argument before the Tribunal.  She referred to <i>Rizzo &amp; Rizzo Shoes Ltd. (Re)</i>, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27 at para. 35
    for the proposition that evidence of legislative history only plays a limited
    role in statutory interpretation.  In any
    event, it is not fatal to a Tribunal’s decision that specific mention is not
    made of certain evidence: <i>Trotta v.
    College of Nurse of Ontario</i>, [1991] O.J. No. 348 (

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the majority erred in granting judicial
    review on the ground that the Vice-Chair committed a “legal error” in failing
    to consider the legislative history of the legislation, thereby rendering her
    decision patently unreasonable.  This was
    despite, as Swinton J. emphasized in her dissenting reasons, the presence of
    substantial reasoning set out in the Tribunal’s decision that reasonably led it
    to make the decision it made.  As well,
    it should be noted that the majority did not disagree with the Tribunal’s
    reasoning, or suggest that the Tribunal could not reach the decision that it
    reached based on that reasoning.  Nor did
    it indicate why it thought that the Tribunal should have considered evidence of
    legislative history.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It would appear that no court has ever interfered with
    any of the thousands of decisions of the Tribunal concerning an employee’s
    pre-accident earnings.  This is no doubt
    due to the substantial degree of deference accorded to the Tribunal based on
    the Legislature’s decision to create the Board and the Tribunal, to vest in the
    Board the exclusive authority to calculate a worker’s pre-accident earnings, to
    delegate to the Tribunal the exclusive authority to review matters of workplace
    safety and insurance, to appoint to the Board and Tribunal members who are
    experienced in issues of workers’ compensation, and to protect the Board and
    the Tribunal with the toughest privative clause known to Ontario law.  The privative clause is most important as it
    evidences a legislature’s intent that an administrative decision maker be given
    greater deference and that interference by reviewing courts be minimized: <i>Dunsmuir</i> at paras. 45 and 48.  Thus, reviewing courts can interfere only
    where the Tribunal’s decision is clearly irrational.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In its decision, the majority focused on the Tribunal’s
    failure to consider evidence of the legislative history of pre-accident earnings.  This was despite the fact that it recognized
    that the standard of review was patent unreasonableness and the fact that it
    found nothing that was irrational about the Board’s decision.  The majority immersed itself in the
    Tribunal’s fact-finding process by reweighing and attributing more weight to
    the evidence of legislative intent than the expert Tribunal felt
    appropriate.  In doing so, it erred.  The only issue was whether the Board’s
    decision was patently unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In its
    analysis, the majority failed to take into account that the evidence of
    legislative history, while admissible, was irrelevant.  Under s. 126(1) of the Act, the Tribunal was
    bound to apply Operational Policy 4.1.  That policy as interpreted by the tribunal, did not include employer
    payments for benefit plans or pension plans in “earnings”.<i></i></p>

    foregoing reasons, the majority erred in finding that the Tribunal’s failure to
    consider evidence of legislative history was a legal error rendering its
    decision patently unreasonable.  The
    Tribunal considered the proper evidence, applied Operational Policy 4.1 and
    found that the employer’s contributions to the respondent worker’s health,
    welfare and employment benefits should not be included when calculating his
    pre-accident earnings.  It had sufficient
    evidence to support this conclusion, which was clearly rational.  It passes muster under the deference standard

    Metal Workers’ International Association, Local No. 30.  His employers paid him according to the terms
    and conditions of the wage schedule of the collective agreement.  For every hour that Mr. Rodrigues worked, and

    wage and vacation pay in that they were all part of the same wage package,
    earned for the same hours of work, and paid only for hours worked.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While at work on March 11, 1998, Mr. Rodrigues suffered
    a serious back injury.  He has been
    unable to work since as a roofer and, based on the medical evidence, it is unlikely
    that he will ever be able to return to such work.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As he was unable to work because of the accident, Mr
    Rodrigues applied to the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (the “Board”) and
    was granted a Future Economic Loss benefits award.  This award was calculated at 85% of the
    difference between entry level wages of $7 per hour and his pre-injury
    earnings.  The Board calculated his
    pre-injury earnings based only on his hourly rate and vacation pay; it did not
    include the contributions made on his behalf to the Plans in its calculation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, in the year following the accident, Mr.
    Rodrigues received compensation for those contributions from the Plans.  This occurred as a result of s. 25 of the <i>Workplace Safety and Insurance Act, 1997, </i>S.O.

    contributions to the worker’s benefits for the first year after the worker is
    injured if the worker is unable to work because of the injury.  However, s. 25(4) relieves employers who
    participate in multi-employer benefit plans from this obligation (i.e. to
    continue to make contributions in the year following the worker’s injury), if
    the plans provide the worker with the benefits to which he or she would
    otherwise be entitled.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Plans provided Mr. Rodrigues with the benefits as

    benefits from the Plans.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Rodrigues applied to the Board to have the employer’s

    employer contributions to the Plans were included in the calculation, his
    pre-accident earnings would be higher, he could claim a larger wage loss

    Tribunal counsel provided the Vice Chair with an excerpt from the Standing
    Committee on Resources Development, Workers’ Compensation Amendment Act, 1989,
    dated June 19, 1989.  This excerpt shows
    that only section 5(a) (now s. 25) contributions were meant to be excluded from
    the definition of earnings.  The
    following is extracted from that excerpt.  It is part of an exchange between Ms. Shelley Martel, member of the
    Standing Committee, and Mr. Richard Clarke, Manager, Policy Branch, Labour Policy
    and Programs, Ministry of Labour.  Ms.
    Martel asked if employers’ benefit contributions would be included in
    determining a worker’s future loss of earnings.  Mr. Clarke replied:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In the amendments that were tabled by the Minister
    with the committee, you will see an amendment to do that.  We made a mistake in drafting the bill in
    that the noninclusion of the employer costs of those benefits should have been
    only for the same period of time, the one year, that the employer was being
    obliged to maintain the benefits.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>           There is an amendment in the
    amendments tabled by the Minister that will make it clear that at the end of
    the one year, when the employer is no longer obliged to maintain<b> </b>those<b> </b>benefits, his or her costs for that worker will then be included
    in the wage and salary calculation for the worker and thus will form part of
    the basis for determining the worker’s loss of earning capacity.  So they will be included at that point.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On my reading of her submissions, Tribunal counsel was
    of the view that the legislative history of the definition of earnings led to
    the conclusion that the contributions in question were to be included as
    earnings after the first year.<a href="#_ftn4"

'>[5]</span></span></span></a> and
    subsequent debates in the Standing Committee on Resources Development regarding
    this amendment to the amendments, suggest that the legislature’s purpose in
    excluding s. 25 contributions from the definition of “earnings” was so that
    employers would not have to pay the contributions twice – once through payments
    into a plan, and then again through calculation in the worker’s earnings
    basis.  <b>However, once the employer was no longer obliged to make the payments,
    there was an expectation that these contributions would again be included in
    the worker’s earnings basis.</b></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In considering what weight should be placed on
    legislative history materials in interpreting legislation, relevant
    considerations include: the reliability of the materials; whether their meaning
    is clear; and whether they have been tainted by partisan politics or other

    earnings are remuneration, Tribunal counsel submitted:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[I]n appropriate circumstances <i>contributions</i> to employment benefits, as opposed to the benefits
    themselves, can be “remuneration”.  Support for this statement is found in the definition of “earnings” in
    the <i>WSIA</i>, which excludes only
    “contributions made under section 25 for employment benefits” from “earnings”,
    thus suggesting that contributions for employment benefits other than those
    made under s. 25 would be included in this definition.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Tribunal counsel submitted that the employer’s
    pre-injury contributions were not excluded from the worker’s earnings by virtue

    basis.   She concluded her submissions to
    that effect, again referencing the legislative history:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Once the worker is no longer receiving the benefit
    of the employer contributions to employment benefits [from the Plans], can the
    value of these benefits again be included in the calculation of the worker’s
    earnings basis?  It is submitted that a
    plain reading of the definition of “earnings” in the <i>WSIA</i> suggests that they can, as these pre-accident contributions to
    employment would no longer be contributions <u>made under s. 25.</u>  A review of the legislative history of the
    Bill 162 amendments to the statutory definition of “earnings” and “wages” also
    supports this interpretation.  </p>

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[17]     Prior
    to 1990, the definition of “earnings” and “wages” was broad and included any remuneration
    capable of being estimated in terms of money without reference to contributions
    for employment benefits: <i>Workmens’
    Compensation Act</i> R.S.O. 1980, c. 539, s. 1(1)(i).</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[18]     In
    1984, the <i>Workmens’ Compensation Act</i> was amended by S.O. 1984, c. 58, s.&nbsp;44(1).  At that time, the notion of “net average earnings” was introduced and
    the Board was then required to deduct the probable Canada Pension Plan (CPP)
    and Employment Insurance (EI) premiums payable by the worker as well as the
    probable amount of income tax from his or her earnings.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[19]     In
    1990, the <i>Workmens’ Compensation Act</i> was amended again by the <i>Workers’
    Compensation Amendment Act</i> S.O. 1989, c. 47, otherwise known as Bill 162.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[20]     In its
    First Reading, Bill 162 included s. 1(2) which amended the definition of
    “earnings”.  It contained the phrase,
    “but does not include contributions for employment benefits”.  Therefore, the proposed amendment at First
    Reading would exclude <i>all</i> contributions for employment benefits.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[21]     This
    was not the final version of the Bill that passed, however.  Section 1(2) of Bill 162 was then itself
    amended at Second Reading in May 1989 with the phrase, “but does not include
    contributions made under section 5(a) for employment benefits”.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[22]     The
    amendment was accompanied by the following statement by the government.  It explained that the exclusion was intended
    to be restricted to contributions made under s. 5(a) only, which is limited to
    one year, commencing from the date of the injury:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>Subsection 1(2)</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>Purpose</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>This amendment will correct an oversight in
    Bill 162.  Under the current Act,
    employers are to report to the WCB their costs of any calculable benefits
    extended to the worker.  Since Bill 162
    extends the actual benefit protection to the worker for certain benefits, the
    employer was relieved from the obligation to include them in the wage or salary
    calculation.  Thus the employer would not
    have to bear the cost twice.  But what
    the Bill does as drafted is delete the obligation to report those costs even
    after the obligation to continue the benefit protection expires.</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>This amendment will correct that oversight by
    restricting the exclusion for the costs of those benefits just to the required
    period of benefit maintenance.</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>For example if the injured worker remains on
    temporary compensation for 18 months, then during the first 12 months, the
    employer will not include as part of the worker’s wages or salary reported to
    the WCB the employer’s costs associated with those benefits being maintained as
    a result of Bill 162.  But, during the
    last 6 months the employer would report the value of the employer’s costs for
    those benefits which he had previously maintained for the injured worker.<b>  </b>These
    would<b> </b>then be reflected in the
    temporary compensation paid to injured worker<b>.</b>  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[23]     Section
    5a was the clause in the Act that required employers or multi-employer benefit
    plans to maintain the contributions that had been made by the employer prior to
    the injury, for one year from the date of the injury.  The exclusion of s. 5(a) contributions in the
    definition of earnings, according to applicant’s counsel, was meant to avoid an
    employer from paying twice – once by the employer under s. 5(a) and secondly,
    by having the same contributions included in the earnings basis.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[24]     Section
    5(a) is the present s. 25 of the Act which reads, in part, as follows:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><b>Employment
    Benefits</b></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>25.(1) Throughout
    the first year after a worker is injured, the employer shall make contributions
    for employment benefits in respect of the worker when the worker is absent from
    work because of the injury.  However, the
    contributions are required only if,</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a)       the
    employer was making contributions for employ-ment benefits in respect of the
    worker when the injury occurred; and</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(b)       the
    worker continues to pay his or her contributions, if any, for the employment
    benefits while the worker is absent from work.  1997, c. 16, Sched. A, s. 25(1).</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><b>Multi-employer
    benefit plans</b></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(4)       Subsection
    (1) does not apply to an employer who participates in a multi-employer benefit
    plan in respect of the worker if, when the worker is absent from work because
    of the injury during the first year after it occurs, </p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a)       the
    plan continues to provide the worker with the benefits to which he or she would
    otherwise be entitled; and</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(b)       the
    plan does not require the employer to make contributions during the worker’s
    absence and does not require the worker to draw upon his or her benefit
    credits, if any, under the plan during the absence.  1997, c. 16, Sched. A, s. 25(4).</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><b>Definition</b></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(7)       In
    this section,</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>“contributions for employment benefits” means
    amounts paid in whole or in part by an employer on behalf of a worker or the
    worker’s spouse, child or dependant for health care, life insurance and pension
    benefits.  1997, c. 16, Sched. A, s.

    New Brunswick</i>,
    [2008] 1 S.C.R. 190, in which it abolished the standard of patent

    standards of review have been collapsed into a single standard of

    now reasonableness, the degree of deference to be afforded the Tribunal
    decision remains the same.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My colleague would allow the appeal because, in his
    view, the majority decision is based on the ground that the Vice Chair
    committed a legal error in failing to consider the legislative history of the
    definition of earnings in the <i>WSIA</i>.  With respect, I do not read the majority
    decision in the same way.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The legal error identified in the majority decision was
    not the failure to consider the legislative history.  Rather, it was the failure of the Vice Chair
    to consider relevant evidence that: (1) had been adduced and relied on by the
    parties, (2) went to the very issue she was required to decide, and (3) might
    have had a significant impact on her findings.  This is clear from paras. 26, 29 and 30 of the majority decision.  Those paragraphs read as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[26]     The
    legislative history and the government’s explanatory purpose of the amendment
    were put before the Vice-Chair, as evidence, but no consideration is given to
    it in her reasons or analysis.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>                                                …</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[29]     What
    is striking in this case is the total failure by either the WSIB or the WSIAT
    to take the legislative history and the government’s explanatory purpose into
    account in any way.  The Vice-Chair was
    engaged in an exercise of statutory interpretation and she considered a variety
    of factors in determining the purpose of the statutory provision and the nature
    of the legislature’s intention.  She
    specifically found that it could not have been the legislature’s intention to
    turn the employment contributions into non-taxable pre-accident earnings or
    intended the result of the legislation to be that workers would receive
    non-taxable earnings.  Having considered
    a multitude of factors with respect to legislative purpose and intention, she
    also should have weighed the evidence of the government’s explanatory purpose
    which on its face makes it clear that the definition of earnings would not
    exclude the contribution for employment benefits at issue in this case.  That is not to say that had the legislative
    history and purpose been considered, the Vice-Chair might not have found it
    determinative and given it less weight in comparison to the other factors that
    she did consider.  She erred in ignoring
    the stated purpose altogether, particularly since it plainly suggests an
    interpretation opposite to the conclusion at which she arrived.  The failure to consider it, as it was
    evidence before her, and to assess its overall weight in the context of the
    factual and legal matrix is a legal error which deprives the decision of
    deference.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[30]     Accordingly,
    in these circumstances, I must conclude that the failure to consider relevant
    evidence that might have had a significant impact on the Vice-Chair’s findings
    renders her decision patently unreasonable.                     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The background facts set out above make clear that the
    majority decision is correct.  The
    legislative history had been urged on the Vice Chair as a highly relevant
    consideration.  That history was relied
    on by the parties and was relevant to her determination.  The issue for the Vice Chair was the meaning
    of “earnings” in s. 2(1) of the Act and, as the Vice Chair explicitly and
    repeatedly recognized, the legislature’s intention was a critical aspect of
    deciding that matter.  As I discuss
    below, the legislative history was clearly relevant to the legislature’s
    intention.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By failing to so much as advert to important evidence
    relevant to the central issue, the Vice Chair erred in a manner which deprived
    her decision of deference – but not because it is a legal requirement that the
    legislative history of a provision be considered whenever an issue of
    interpretation of the provision arises.  Neither the majority decision nor I suggest that it is a requirement in
    law that the legislative history of a provision always be considered.  The use of legislative history as a tool for
    determining the intention of the legislature is appropriate and often employed
    by the Supreme Court of Canada and this court.<a

    Chair took it into account.  It is trite
    law that tribunal decisions must be based on a consideration of all relevant
    factors and evidence.  An unbroken line
    of cases from the Supreme Court of Canada makes clear that a failure to

    be watched for:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The danger of labelling the most “deferential”
    standard as “reasonableness” is that it may be taken (wrongly) as an invitation
    to reviewing judges not simply to identify the usual issues, such as whether

    taken into consideration,  … </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The majority decision does not amount to a reweighing
    of the evidence before the Vice Chair.  Quite the contrary.  It undertook
    no weighing of the evidence.  Instead, it
    remitted the matter so that a determination could be made in accordance with
    the foundational principles of administrative law, namely that the decision
    maker consider all relevant evidence and factors.  In remitting the matter, the majority
    decision expressly recognized that the Tribunal was not bound by the
    legislative history and that the history was not determinative.  It left a weighing of all of the relevant
    factors and evidence to the Tribunal – an attitude of deference which the courts
    properly owe the Tribunal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both the jurisprudence and the submissions of the
    parties to the Vice Chair make it obvious that the legislative history of the
    meaning of earnings in s. 2(1) of the <i>WSIA </i>was relevant in the present case.  I
    do not accept that Operational Policy 4.1 somehow made it irrelevant.  Policy cannot “trump” legislation.  A decision maker is bound to consider all
    significant evidence adduced by a party that goes to a material issue and, in
    any event, the Policy does not exclude such a consideration.  The Policy lists many types of payments and
    then states whether that payment is included in, or excluded from,
    earnings.  Here, the question was not
    whether a payment was to be included but whether contributions that would go to
    the payment of benefits under certain plans were to be treated as
    earnings.  Moreover, although the Policy
    does not list these contributions as being included in earnings, it also does
    not list them as being excluded or not included; as my colleague notes, it simply
    makes no mention of such contributions.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Deference to a tribunal does not mean ignoring a
    failure by the tribunal to conform to the foundational principles that inform
    judicial review.  Deference is founded on
    the notion that the decision maker has complied with the appropriate procedural
    and fairness considerations.  Here, the
    court would be abdicating its supervisory role if it failed to set aside the
    decision because the Vice Chair failed to consider relevant evidence.  As the matter stands, neither the parties nor
    the courts can know whether she considered the legislative history of
    “earnings” in s. 2(1).  By failing to
    address a relevant matter, the Vice Chair has effectively foreclosed the
    opportunity for meaningful judicial review.  It is that danger which is obviated when a court requires adherence to
    the basic principle that a decision maker must take into consideration all
    relevant evidence before coming to a determination. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The majority decision is correct.  Where there is highly significant and
    relevant evidence that goes to the very matter a tribunal must decide, there
    must be some indication that the decision maker considered it.  Rationality and reasonableness are not solely
    a matter of whether the result is supportable.  Those notions also involve a consideration as to whether the tribunal
    has acted in accordance with the principles of fairness which the courts have
    laid down.  It is neither reasonable nor
    rational to completely ignore the evidence in question, particularly where, as
    here, that evidence suggests an interpretation opposite to the one reached by
    the Vice Chair. </p>
