  <h2>A.        <u>INTRODUCTION</u></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant, Alice Phillips, was convicted of
    importing cocaine following a trial before Dawson J. and a jury.  The appellant was tried with a co-accused,
    Julia Grayson.  The jury was unable to reach
    a verdict regarding Grayson, resulting in a mistrial.  The appellant received a sentence of five
    years and four months imprisonment in addition to credit for eight months
    pre-trial custody.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant appeals her conviction and
    sentence.  Unusually, the principal
    ground of her conviction appeal relates to an alleged post-verdict incident
    involving a member of the jury and how the trial judge handled the incident
    after he became aware of it.  The only
    ground of the sentence appeal is that the trial judge failed to consider the
    appellant’s co-operation with the police following her arrest when he imposed
    sentence.</p>
  <h2>B.        <u>FACTS</u></h2>
  <h2>            (i)        <u>The parties and events</u></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Alice Phillips was 21 years old in late 2002.  She was a single parent of a two year old
    daughter and lived with her mother.  She
    was a close friend of 22 year old Julia Grayson.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant and Grayson were given plane
    tickets for a trip to St. Maarten by a man the appellant identified as “
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Gary”.  According to the appellant, after providing
    the plane tickets,
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Gary asked the two women to
    do him a favour by delivering money to one of his friends in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Curacao.  The appellant asked
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Gary
    why he did not wire the money, and
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Gary
    explained that this would be too expensive. 
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Gary
    handed each of the women three envelopes containing money.  He suggested that they put the envelopes in
    the waistband of their pants, which they did. 
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Gary
    then handed the appellant a card with the name “Serge”, and contact information
    for him.  He told the women that
    travelling to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Curacao from St. Maarten
    required a one hour flight, which they should pay for with money from the
    envelopes.  The appellant thought that
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    Gary’s request was “kind of strange”, but did not “make
    much of it” because she knew that people were “always” sending money home to
    their families in the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Caribbean.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant and Grayson flew to St. Maarten
    and then on to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Curacao.  They met Serge and gave him the money in the
    envelopes.  They stayed three days in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    Curacao.  On the
    day of their departure, Serge gave them two new suitcases.  The women flew back to St. Maarten and to
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto the following
    day.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On November 24, 2002, the two women arrived at
    <st1:place

    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Pearson
    <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">
    International
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Airport.  Their luggage was searched by Canada Customs
    personnel.  Inside the flaps of both
    suitcases, customs officials found cocaine – 2533 grams in the appellant’s and
    2424 grams in Grayson’s.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant and Grayson were arrested and

    trial</u></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial commenced before Dawson J. and a jury
    on November 29, 2004.  The principal
    issue was whether the two women knew that there were packs of cocaine sewn into
    their suitcases.  During the trial, there
    was expert testimony that the street value of the cocaine in the
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto area was between
    $495,800 and $618,500.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The jury began deliberating on the afternoon of
    December 15, 2004.  On December 16 at
    about 12:20 p.m., the jury rendered a guilty verdict with respect to the
    appellant.  The jury then continued its
    deliberations with respect to Grayson over the lunch and into the
    afternoon.  The trial judge delivered an
    exhortation, but the jury was unable to reach a verdict.  The trial judge declared a mistrial at 4:02
    p.m.  He discharged the jury.</p>
  <h2>(3)       <u>The
    post-trial incident and its aftermath</u></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On December 17, 2004, the trial judge received
    information that two court services officers who had looked after the jury
    wanted to meet with him in his office about a matter of some concern involving
    a juror in the trial that had finished the previous day.  The trial judge was not comfortable meeting
    the officers in his office and decided that he wanted a record of the meeting.  Accordingly, he arranged for a meeting in a
    courtroom with a court reporter present.  He did not notify the two accused or their counsel of this meeting or
    invite them to attend.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the courtroom, the trial judge opened the
    proceedings with this statement:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>THE COURT:            I
    just should say this.  This really isn’t
    sort of court, it’s more in the nature of a meeting.  I don’t know what I’m about to hear but I
    wanted to have a reporter and it really shouldn’t have a style of cause that
    has anything in the proceedings that we were in before.  I think it’s really sort of In the Matter of
    a Juror or something of that sort.  In
    the Matter of an Inquiry about a juror, and actually I think what I should do
    is just hear – I have no idea what I’m about to hear really, I’ve just got some
    vague understanding that there is a matter of some concern and I don’t really
    want to get deeply involved in any kind of questioning or anything, I just want
    to hear the basics and thought I should hear it with the reporter present so.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Two people, Marlene Bracciale, a court services
    office, and Constable Peter McLaughlin, then made statements.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Bracciale explained that the day before,
    directly after the verdict, she had been contacted by a court services officer
    named Vic Babinski.  Bracciale was
    Babinski’s supervisor.  Babinski told
    Bracciale that as he was accompanying the jury out of the building after the
    verdict, he was approached by one juror, Ms. W.<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  According to Bracciale, Ms. W. advised
    Babinski that she lived alone with her son and that she feared for her safety
    because of possible retaliation from other jurors, who had taunted her during
    deliberations.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Bracciale advised the trial judge that as a
    result of this information, she asked Constable McLaughlin to speak to Ms. W.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Constable McLaughlin told the trial judge that
    he left the courthouse and found Ms. W. in her vehicle.  McLaughlin said that Ms. W. seemed to be
    upset, was crying, shaking slightly, and that her voice was trembling a little
    bit.  According to McLaughlin, Ms. W.
    said that other jurors had threatened to have her kicked off the jury.  She also said that during the trial she
    received hang-up telephone calls, possibly from other jury members.  At this point, Ms. W. became very upset.  McLaughlin spent some time trying to calm her
    down.  He told her that he had never met
    someone so upset about being on a jury.  In response, Ms. W. said, in a remark that McLaughlin wrote down:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I had a boyfriend 20 years ago.  He got caught at the border bringing in
    drugs.  I saw what he went through.  I could never put someone else through
    that.  I never could have convicted
    someone for doing what he did for doing that.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>McLaughlin then advised Ms. W. to go home and
    relax, “just take half a day to sort out her feelings and then to give me a
    call today.”  McLaughlin also told Ms. W.
    that if there was any investigation into the conduct of a juror, she could
    contact him.  Ms. W. said that was fine
    and she departed   It is common ground
    that Ms. W. never contacted Constable McLaughlin after this conversation, nor
    was a police investigation commenced. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The meeting in the courtroom on December 17
    ended with the trial judge saying that he needed to think about what to
    do.  He ordered a transcript of the
    meeting which is six pages.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After the meeting, the trial judge provided a
    copy of the transcript together with copies of brief statements and notes
    prepared by Babinski, Bracciale and McLaughlin to Crown counsel and both
    defence counsel.  Counsel for the
    appellant sent a letter to the trial judge on January 9, 2005 requesting a
    hearing to have the verdict set aside and a mistrial declared.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On February 1, 2005, a hearing took place before
    the trial judge.  The appellant, her
    counsel and Crown counsel were present.  The Babinski and Bracciale notes and the transcript of the December 17,
    2004 meeting were marked as exhibits.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge commented on the December 17,
    2004 meeting in this fashion:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>What happened was, on December 17<sup>th</sup>,
    another court services officer approached me and said that two of the CSOs – we
    will use the short form – who had been looking after the jury, wanted to meet
    with me in my office and tell me something.  But I wasn’t advised what it was they wanted to tell me and so, of
    course, once one’s antennae go up and you’re wondering what it is.  But I had no way of knowing whether it was a
    matter of significance or a trivial matter.  I had no way of knowing.  But I
    did know that I didn’t think I should be meeting with them in my office and not
    having a record of what was said.  So
    when I came into the courtroom, where that transcript was generated that day,
    that was the first time I had any information from anyone who was directly
    involved in – in what I was later told about.  So it was sort of unfolding in front of me.  And it wasn’t really in the nature of an
    inquiry.  If I would have thought there
    was any reason to hold an inquiry, I would have notified counsel.  I’d just – I’d been advised they wanted to
    talk to me.  I had absolutely no idea the
    significance of it one way or another, and I thought I should hear what they
    had to say, but I wanted to have a permanent record of it.  So I indicated to them that we would treat it
    as if it was a – just a private – or a discussion in my office, but with a
    formal record being made.  And I – it
    wasn’t an open court situation.  The one,
    Ms. Bracciale, was – when she was in the room with me, there was just myself
    and her, and a court reporter, and no one else.  And then when the officer came in, she went out.  So that’s the – the extent of it.  And then once I heard what it was about, my
    conclusion was the best thing to do was simply send it to counsel and counsel
    could decide what they wanted to do.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>During the discussion which followed, the trial
    judge indicated that he had done some research and doubted he had jurisdiction
    to do anything more about the information he had received.  Defence counsel acknowledged that the troubling
    incident on December 16, 2004 had happened after the departure of the accused
    and both counsel had left the courthouse.  She stated: “But I wonder – I wonder why we’re not – we didn’t have an
    inquiry with respect to that juror.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the end, defence counsel confirmed that she
    wanted to proceed with an application for a mistrial.  The trial judge and counsel agreed to set
    aside two hours for argument on March 7, 2005.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

    included her youth, her relationship with her young daughter and her mother, fairly
    steady employment, and an apparent change in attitude in the months between her
    conviction and the sentence hearing.  The
    trial judge noted the pervasive problem of drug couriers bringing large volumes
    of cocaine through the airport and observed that appellate courts had set a
    range of six to eight years imprisonment for importation of multiple kilograms
    of cocaine.</p>

    trial judge on December 17, 2004 into potential problems among jurors, which
    was conducted in the absence of the appellant and counsel, violated s. 650(1)

    does not appear to be part of the appellant’s trial.  In <i>R.
    v. Hertrich, Stewart and Skinner</i> (1982), 67 C.C.C. (2d) 510 (On.
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), Martin
    J.A. provided a fulsome description of the components of a trial, at p. 527:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>“[T]rial” for the purpose of the principle that an
    accused is entitled to be present at his trial clearly includes proceedings
    which are part of the normal trial process for determining the guilt or
    innocence of the accused such as arraignment and plea, the empanelling of the
    jury, the reception of evidence (including <i>voir
    dire</i> proceedings with respect to the admissibility of evidence), rulings on
    evidence, arguments of counsel, addresses of counsel to the jury, the judge’s
    charge, including requests by the jury for further instructions, the reception
    of the verdict and the imposition of sentence if the accused is found guilty.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>In this case, it is clear that the
    initial inquiry conducted by the trial judge does not fit within this
    description.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant attempts to overcome this problem
    by relying on a line of cases in which the courts have held that, for the
    purpose of a s. 650(1) analysis, an accused must be present for any part of the
    proceedings where his or her “vital interests” are at stake.  As expressed by Dickson C.J.C. in <i>R. v. Barrow</i> [1987] 2 S.C.R. 694 at
    para. 21, in a passage that explains both the history and the contents of the
    “vital interests” principle:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The question of what is included in the trial for
    purposes of s. 577(1)<a href="#_ftn2"

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

    addressed by this court in <i>V</i><i><span style='"Times New Roman"'>é</span>zina
    and C</i><i><span style='"Times New Roman"'>ô</span>t</i><i><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>é</span> v. The Queen</i> [1986]
    1 S.C.R. 2.  Justice Lamer for the court
    held that the right to be present at trial included the right to be present at
    an examination of jurors for partiality after the trial had begun.  Adopting the reasoning of Martin J.A. in <i>Hertrich</i>, Lamer J. held that the test of
    what should be included in “trial” was not limited to the presentation of the
    case against the accused and to matters that directly affected the decision as
    to guilt or innocence, such as rulings on the admissibility of evidence.  For Lamer J., s. 577(1) is triggered whenever
    the “vital interests” of the accused are at stake, or as Martin J.A. put it in <i>Hertrich</i>, when a decision bears on the
    “substantive conduct of the trial.”  Any
    question about the partiality of the jurors individually or the jury as a whole
    reflects on the substantive conduct of the trial and must be dealt with in the
    presence of the accused.  The accused has
    a right to a fair trial as well as a right to hear the case and make a
    defence.  Section 577(1) protects both
    rights.  In both <i>Hertrich</i> and <i>V</i><i><span style='"Times New Roman"'>é</span>zina</i>,
    s. 577(1) was infringed when the judge examined jurors for partiality after the
    trial began and in the absence of the accused.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant submits that when the trial judge
    convened the meeting on December 17, 2004, the matter before him was a
    “question about the partiality of the jurors individually or the jury as a
    whole” and that this affected the “vital interests” of the accused, thus
    requiring her presence by virtue of the s. 650(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Crown submits that the meeting on December
    17 was not an inquiry into the partiality of the juror, but only the means by
    which the trial judge gathered sufficient information to determine what, if
    anything, should be done.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In my view, the answer to the appellant’s
    submission can be stated in a single word – hindsight.  The reality is that when the trial judge
    convened the meeting he knew virtually nothing about what he was about to hear,
    except that it involved a matter of some concern relating to a juror.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In these circumstances, the trial judge did
    precisely what was suggested by Lamer J. in <i>V</i><i><span style='"Times New Roman"'>é</span>zina, </i>at para. 19:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I am of the view that if on the facts of a case it
    is uncertain whether the accused’s vital interests are involved, the judge may
    in the absence of the accused, investigate the matter.  This would include questioning the jurors
    and, if the judge determines that these vital interests of the accused are not
    in issue that ends the matter, subject of course to a record being kept of the
    proceedings in order to determine whether he erred as regards there being
    uncertainty of what was in issue at the outset and as regards his final
    determination of the matter.  This is
    what occurred in the <i>Hertrich</i> case.  But as of the moment it appears
    those vital interests are in issue, the issue must be determined in the
    presence of the accused.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge convened a meeting that he
    referred to as a meeting or inquiry, not a trial, and arranged to have a
    reporter present so that a record of the proceedings could be kept for
    appellate review.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After he heard the statements by Bracciale and
    McLaughlin, he deliberated for a time, decided that the “vital interests” of
    the accused might be at stake, and sent a transcript of the proceedings to
    counsel.  At the request of defence
    counsel, he then convened a hearing on February 1, 2005 with the accused and
    counsel present.  In my view, in the
    context of a highly unusual and potentially difficult incident, the trial
    judge’s thinking and decisions on December 17, 2004 were entirely appropriate.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover, nothing that happened at the December
    17 meeting prejudiced the appellant in any way.  A full record of the brief proceedings was kept and, in short order,
    circulated to counsel.  When defence
    counsel indicated that she wanted to apply for a mistrial, a hearing was
    scheduled for February 1, 2005.  Accordingly, on this latter date the appellant was in a good position to
    take any steps she wanted.  She did
    so.  She indicated an intention to make
    an application for a mistrial.  The trial
    judge scheduled a hearing for the precise date proposed by defence counsel,
    March 7, 2005.  On that date, having
    reviewed the legal authorities, defence counsel abandoned this application.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In summary, the December 17, 2004 meeting was
    not part of the trial within the meaning of s. 650(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  Accordingly, the appellant’s presence was not
    required.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The remaining question is whether the trial
    judge should have done something more at the hearing on February 1, 2005.  Counsel for the appellant, who was not trial
    counsel, suggests that the trial judge should have interviewed the juror who
    spoke to the two court officers, even if only to build a record for possible
    use on appeal.  She acknowledges that the
    purpose of the interview would not have been to lay a foundation for a mistrial
    application because by February 1, 2005 the trial judge was almost certainly <i>functus officio</i> concerning the guilty
    verdict: see <i>Head v. The Queen</i>,
    [1986] 2 S.C.R. 684, and <i>R. v. Burke</i>,
    [2002] 2 S.C.R. 857.  However, counsel
    contends that the trial judge should have initiated an interview with the juror
    with a view to creating a record for later review on an appeal to this court.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I disagree.  Although trial counsel was aware of this possibility, she did not
    request it, preferring instead her proposed mistrial application.  In my view, with the accused represented by
    experienced and capable counsel who had an opportunity to review the entire
    record of the initial meeting and to consider her options, it would be entirely
    wrong for this court to impose on the trial judge an investigative role that
    neither counsel proposed.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant seeks to have admitted as fresh
    evidence in this court the transcript of the December 17, 2004 meeting with a
    view to it being accepted as proof that Ms. W. was truly afraid of the other jurors,
    allowing for the inference that Ms. W. did not make her determination in
    accordance with her conscience.  The
    appellant submits that this was not a case in which, after a number of days of
    reflection, a juror came to have second thoughts.  Nor is it a case in which a juror changed her
    mind after viewing media reports of the case.  Rather, the juror waited at the end of the line to turn in her parking
    pass, was observed to be upset, and spoke immediately to one officer and then
    in more detail to another officer in the parking lot.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There is at common law a jury secrecy rule which
    the Supreme Court of Canada explained in this fashion in <i>R. v. Pan, R. v. Sawyer</i> [2001] 2 S.C.R. 344 at para. 77:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Statements made, opinions expressed, arguments
    advanced and votes cast by members of a jury in the course of their
    deliberations are inadmissible in any legal proceedings.  In particular, jurors may not testify about
    the effect of anything on their or other jurors’ minds, emotions or ultimate
    decision.  On the other hand, the common
    law rule does not render inadmissible evidence of facts, statements or events
    extrinsic to the deliberation process, whether originating from a juror or from
    a third party, that may have tainted the verdict.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant submits that the evidence flowing
    from Ms. W.’s conversations with Bracciale and McLaughlin is evidence of events
    extrinsic to the deliberation process and is, therefore, admissible.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the alternative, the appellant submits that
    this evidence is admissible by virtue of an exception created in <i>Pan and Sawyer</i> with respect to evidence
    of a potential offence under s. 139 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>: the obstruction of justice in a judicial proceeding by, <i>inter alia</i>, influencing or attempting to
    influence by threats a person in her conduct as a juror.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In my view, it is not necessary to consider
    these submissions on their merits because the evidence of what Ms. W. told
    Bracciale and McLaughlin is hearsay evidence and, therefore, inadmissible,
    including in a fresh evidence context: see <i>R.
    v. O’Brien</i>, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 591, and <i>R.
    v. Truscott</i> (2007), 225 C.C.C. (3d) 321 (On.

style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant concedes that the evidence of Ms.
    W.’s statements to the two court personnel cannot be admitted under the principled
    exception to the hearsay rule.  However,
    she urges us to relax those rules in this case because, otherwise, there is no
    way for this court to explore whether there were any improprieties infecting
    the jury’s deliberations and verdict.  For
    two reasons, I incline against accepting this submission.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First, there were avenues, in both trial and
    appeal contexts, to overcome the hearsay hurdle.  The trial defence counsel could have asked
    the trial judge at the hearing on February 1, 2005 to conduct an inquiry and
    compel Ms. W., and possibly other jurors, to attend and testify about the
    matters presented by Ms. W.’s conversations.  If this had happened, even if the trial judge could not have interfered
    with the verdict because he was <i>functus</i>,
    a record would have been created for this court’s consideration on the
    appeal.  Alternatively, appeal counsel
    could have achieved the same result by invoking s. 683(1)(d) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, which would authorize
    this court to hear the same testimony.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second, the information from Ms. W. currently on
    the record, as reflected in the six page transcript and three exhibits from the
    December 17, 2004 hearing, is meagre and fragile.  Perhaps what Ms. W. said to the court
    personnel is true or perhaps it is entirely false; there is no way of knowing
    on the basis of the present record.  It
    would be wrong to assume the accuracy or truthfulness of remarks made mere
    minutes after the conclusion of a two-and-a-half week jury trial.  At that moment, emotion, stress, uncertainty,
    anger, exhaustion and even regret might well have been in play.  In that vein, I note that Ms. W. did not take
    up Constable McLaughlin’s invitation at the end of their brief conversation to
    call him the next day if she wanted to pursue the matter.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For these reasons, I would not admit as fresh
    evidence the evidence relating to Ms. W.’s conversations with Bracciale and
    McLaughlin for the truth of their contents.</p>
  <h2>(3)       <u>Evidence

style='"Times New Roman"'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant contends that the trial judge
    erred by admitting evidence of her impecuniosity because this evidence might
    lead to improper propensity reasoning – because the appellant was relatively
    poor, she might be more inclined to commit a crime for financial gain: see <i>R. v. Mensah</i> (2003), 170 O.A.C.
    244.  This error was compounded, the
    appellant submits, by the trial judge’s failure to instruct the jury on how to
    consider evidence of motive generally or the appellant’s impecuniosity in
    particular.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I disagree.  The evidence about the appellant’s financial situation relied on by the
    Crown and referred to by the trial judge in his jury charge related to the
    recent change in the appellant’s employment situation from very good full-time
    work to sporadic part-time work.  This
    change, not the appellant’s general impecuniosity, was suggested as a possible
    motive for the appellant’s willingness to be a drug courier.  In this respect, this appeal is in fact
    similar to <i>Mensah</i> where this court
    upheld the trial judge’s decision to admit evidence of the accused’s deferral
    of an employment opportunity to suggest motive to be a drug courier.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover, there was no need for the trial judge
    to provide a general instruction on motive at this trial.  The trial judge and counsel engaged in an
    extensive discussion of the jury charge before it was delivered.  They agreed that the crucial, and practically
    sole, issue was knowledge.  This is
    reflected in the <i>pr</i><i><span style='"Times New Roman"'>é</span>cis </i>prepared by counsel setting out their positions.  These were read <i>verbatim</i> by the trial judge to the jury.  The main focus of these submissions was knowledge.  Finally, the appellant’s counsel, who had
    been active in the discussion leading up to the jury charge, made no objection
    after the charge.</p>
  <h2>(4)       <u>The
    appellant’s interest in outcome and presumption of innocence</u></h2>

    unfairly singled her out for consideration of her credibility in light of her

style='"Times New Roman"'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I disagree.  The trial judge provided a comprehensive list of factors for the jury to
    use to evaluate credibility.  The
    potential interest of a witness in the outcome of the case was but one factor
    on the list.  The only references by the
    trial judge to this factor in the rest of the charge occurred when he set out
    potential inconsistencies between the testimony of the appellant and the
    co-accused and between the co-accused and other witnesses.  In these contexts, the references were
    appropriate.  Finally, the trial judge

  <h2>(5)       <u>The
    sentence</u></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge sentenced the appellant to six
    years imprisonment, consisting of five years and four months of custody and
    eight months credit for four months of pre-trial custody.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At the time of her arrest, the appellant
    provided a videotaped statement to the police.  The statement was ruled inadmissible on voluntariness grounds at the
    trial.  In the statement, the appellant
    provided information about ‘
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Gary’
    and ‘Serge’ that, at the sentence hearing, the appellant contended amounted to
    co-operation with the police.  The trial
    judge did not mention this matter in his reasons for sentence.  The appellant argues that this omission
    constituted an error of law: see <i>R. v.
    H.(C.N.)</i> (2002), 170 C.C.C. (3d) 253 (On.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I disagree.  The information provided by the appellant was meagre: one man’s first
    name was ‘Gary’, ‘George’ or ‘G’ and the second man’s first name was ‘Serge’,
    ‘Sergio’ or ‘Sergo’; no last names were given; and several of these statements
    were followed by qualifications like “or whatever his name is” or “something
    like that”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover, the information provided by the
    appellant was of little assistance to the police because almost all of it was
    easily discoverable from a search of the appellant’s effects upon her arrest.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, the appellant received a sentence of
    six years.  The sentence range for a
    first time offender acting as a courier in the importation of several kilograms
    of cocaine is six to eight years: see <i>R.
    v. Cunningham</i> (1996), 104 C.C.C. (3d) 542 (On.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  The appellant was not a first time
    offender.  She was also on probation when
    she committed the importing offence.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In summary, the trial judge did not commit an
    error in imposing a six year sentence on the appellant.</p>
