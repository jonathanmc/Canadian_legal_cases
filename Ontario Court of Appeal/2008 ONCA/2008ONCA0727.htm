  <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Deutsch appeals his conviction for perjury
    and applies for leave to appeal his sentence of fourteen months.</p>
  <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant appeared before Justice Thomson in
    Small Claims Court and sought to represent one of the parties to a civil
    action.  Justice Thomson ordered that
    there be a hearing as to the competence of Mr. Deutsch to appear before the
    court.  At the hearing which followed,
    Mr. Deutsch testified under oath that he was a member of the New York State Bar
    who had licenced him to practice law.  As
    a result, Mr. Deutsch was subsequently charged with the following offence:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>MELVIN DEUTSCH stands
    charged that he, on or about the 9<sup>th</sup> day of January in the year
    2002, at the City of Toronto, in the Toronto Region, did commit perjury at the
    trial in the Superior Court of Justice situated at 47 Sheppard Avenue East, in
    the judicial proceeding of Fleet Rent a Car and Vadim Bidnyk a.k.a. Vadym Bidnyk
    by swearing falsely and with intent to mislead the court <u>that he was
    licenced to practice law in the State of New York</u>, contrary to the Criminal
    Code.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Deutsch proceeded to trial on the perjury
    charge and several other charges under the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> before Justice Todd Ducharme of the Superior Court of Justice.  He was convicted of the perjury charge and
    acquitted of all other charges.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In support of the perjury charge, the Crown
    called Samuel Younger, an employee of the Office of Court Administration, the Unified
    Court System of the State of
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    New York.  Mr. Younger was the Chief Management Analyst
    of the Attorney Registration Unit in the Office of Court Administration.  He testified that one of his primary
    responsibilities was to maintain the centralized roll of attorneys in the State
    of
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    New York.  He explained that in order to practice before
    the courts of the State of
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    New York, a person “must
    be a member of the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    New York
    bar and be listed in the central registry of attorneys maintained by [his]
    office”.  He testified that he had
    checked the centralized roll of attorneys and found no record for Mr.
    Deutsch.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge ruled that the <i>viva voce</i> evidence of Mr. Younger
    concerning the lack of registration for Mr. Deutsch was inadmissible
    hearsay.  The trial judge also held that
    the copy of a printout of the result of a search of the computer records for
    the name Melvin Deutsch was inadmissible as the document was not accompanied by
    the affidavits required by s. 30(3) of the <i>Canada
    Evidence Act</i> R.S.C. 1985, c. C-5.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Subsequent to the trial judge’s ruling, the
    Crown tendered in evidence a sworn certificate of Mr. Younger in which he
    deposed:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I, Samuel H. Younger, am
    a/the custodian of records and do certify that these records are true and
    accurate copies of records maintained by the Office of Court Administration in
    the regular course of business, and it is this institution’s regular business
    to maintain such records.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Attached to the certificate was a computer printout
    of a name search of the New York State Unified Court System indicating that no
    records were found for Melvin Deutsch.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge ruled that the document was
    admissible as a business record pursuant to s. 30 of the <i>Canada Evidence Act</i>.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On the basis of this evidence, the trial judge
    concluded:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>As a result I find that
    Mr. Deutsch by claiming to be a member of the New York State Bar made several
    false statements while testifying under oath before Justice [Thomson], a person
    authorized to receive such sworn testimony.  In assessing Mr. Deutsch’s understanding of these statements I accept
    Mr. Younger’s evidence as to the requirements for admission to the New York
    State Bar.  Given these requirements Mr.
    Deutsch could not have been mistaken as to whether or not he was indeed a
    member of the New York State Bar.  Consequently I find that Mr. Deutsch must have
    known the statements were false at the time he made them.  The nature of the statements and the context
    in which they were made also satisfy me beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr.
    Deutsch made these statements with an intention to mislead.  Specifically I find that Mr. Deutsch made the
    statements with the intention of misleading Justice [Thomson] into believing he
    was a properly qualified attorney.  Therefore I am satisfied that the Crown has proven all the elements of
    perjury beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge made reference to s. 133 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> which provides:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>No person shall be
    convicted of an offence under s. 132 [perjury] on the evidence of only one
    witness unless the evidence of that witness is corroborated in a material
    particular by evidence that implicates the accused.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge ruled that corroboration under
    s. 133 was not required as Mr. Deutsch was not convicted “on the evidence of
    only one witness”.  It was the trial
    judge’s opinion that the falsity of Mr. Deutsch’s statements was proven by the
    business record that was admitted pursuant to the <i>Canada Evidence Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In respect of sentence, the trial judge
    concluded that a fit sentence was fourteen months in custody.  The trial judge gave Mr. Deutsch two months
    credit for his pre-trial custody and imposed a sentence of twelve months to be
    served consecutively to any sentence he was then serving.</p>
  <h2>THE APPEAL FROM CONVICTION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On the appeal, Mr. Deutsch made submissions on
    his own behalf and Mr. Scott Hutchison, duty counsel, made submissions
    concerning the requirement of corroboration pursuant to s. 133 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  Mr. Hutchison submitted that the trial judge
    erred in holding that the printout of the name search admitted in evidence
    pursuant to s. 30 of the <i>Evidence Act</i> did not require corroboration pursuant to s. 133 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Deutsch also filed a factum in which he
    raised a multitude of issues which included:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>at the preliminary hearing, the Crown was guilty
    of prosecutorial misconduct;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Deutsch was denied a trial in French;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the evidence before the trial judge and at the
    pre-liminary hearing established that he was a member of the New York State
    Bar;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(iv)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the Crown led evidence at trial that Mr. Deutsch
    was a notary public in the State of
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    New York
    based on the fact that he was an attorney in the State of
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    New York which the trial judge should have
    accepted;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(v)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Younger admitted that his records did not
    relate to attorneys who practiced in the Federal Courts in the State of New
    York and that it was possible that an attorney who was qualified to practice in
    the Federal Courts would not be included in the records of the New York State
    Unified Court System; </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(vi)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the evidence of Mr. Younger should not have been
    accepted by the trial judge on a number of grounds including that Mr. Deutsch
    was denied the right of cross-examination of Mr. Younger on the sworn
    certificate.  </p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>Mr. Deutsch made brief reference in
    his oral submissions to some of the above grounds of appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Deutsch also raised an issue concerning
    trial fairness arising out of his inability to hear the trial proceedings.  He claimed he did not have his hearing aids
    because they were lost by the correctional staff.  We were not directed to any evidence in the
    record to support this submission.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As indicated below, the only issue raised by Mr.
    Deutsch that I find it necessary to address is the admission by Mr. Younger
    that his records did not relate to attorneys who practiced in the Federal
    courts of the State of
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    New York
    – the “Federal courts” issue.</p>
  <h2>The Federal Courts Issue</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As is often the case in inmate appeals, we were
    not provided with a transcript of the evidence of the trial – in spite of the
    fact that Mr. Deutsch had brought a motion to require the Crown to order the
    transcript.  The Crown successfully
    opposed that motion.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After the oral hearing was completed and upon
    reviewing the grounds of appeal asserted by Mr. Deutsch, we determined that we
    at least had to have the transcript of Mr. Younger’s evidence to do justice to
    this case.  A transcript of Mr. Younger’s
    evidence was provided with the assistance of the Crown.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>One part of Mr. Younger’s evidence, which I
    reproduce here, gave us concern:</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The above evidence addresses the point raised by
    Mr. Deutsch that Mr. Younger admitted that his records did not relate to
    attorneys qualified to practice in the Federal courts in the State of
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    New York.  Bearing in mind that the indictment charged
    Mr. Deutsch with committing perjury “by swearing falsely and with intent to
    mislead the court that he was licensed to practice law in the State of New
    York, contrary to the <i>Criminal Code</i>”,
    we were concerned that this evidence of Mr. Younger simply did not prove beyond
    a reasonable doubt the charge before the court.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We invited further submissions in writing from
    Crown counsel, Alison Wheeler, Mr. Hutchison and Mr. Deutsch.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms. Wheeler, fairly and frankly, conceded that
    the reasons for judgment of the trial judge, which were delivered orally, did
    not address this issue.  In delivering
    his oral reasons, the trial judge had stated: “I wish to be clear that my
    reasons for judgment will be the written reasons I release, not the written
    summary I provide today”.  No written
    reasons were later released.  Ms. Wheeler
    submitted, however, that the trial judge’s oral reasons reflect an
    understanding of the case, shared by defence counsel, that the issue at trial
    was whether the Crown had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Deutsch was
    not licensed to practice law by the New York State Bar and that the trial had
    proceeded on that basis.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for the Crown further submitted: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The trial judge’s
    reasons do not address the issue “licensed to practice in the State of
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    New York” as opposed to
    “licensed to practice by the New York State Bar Association”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Crown proposed that one solution to the
    problem posed was to amend the indictment pursuant to s. 683(1)(g) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> which provides:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>683.    (1)       For
    the purposes of an appeal under this Part, the court of appeal may, where it
    considers it in the interests of justice,</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(g)       amend the indictment, unless it is of the
    opinion that the accused has been misled or prejudiced in his defence or
    appeal.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>The Crown suggested that the
    indictment could be amended to charge Mr. Deutsch with “swearing falsely and
    with intent to mislead the court that he was licensed to practice law by the
    New York State Bar”.  Accordingly, if such
    amendment were made by this court, the appropriate result would simply be to
    dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Crown relied on this court’s judgment in <i>R. v. Irwin</i> (1998), 123 C.C.C. (3d) 316
    (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    )
    at para. 31 where Doherty J.A. said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>If as
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>St.</i><i> Clair</i> holds, s. 683(1)(<i>g</i>)
    is broad enough to permit an amendment which adds an offence to an indictment,
    it must be broad enough to permit an amendment which substitutes one charge for
    another.  I would hold that s. 683(1)(<i>g</i>) permits an amendment on appeal where
    the amendment cures a variance between the charge laid and the evidence led at
    trial regardless of whether the amendment materially changes the charge,
    substitutes a new charge for the initial charge, or adds an additional charge.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms. Wheeler fairly acknowledged that if the
    “Federal courts” issue was in fact argued at trial by defence counsel and not
    addressed in the trial judge’s reasons, it was unlikely that the Crown could
    now seek the suggested amendment to the indictment.  However, she further submitted that if the
    court was satisfied that defence counsel had “put forward every argument that
    related to proof of a falsehood in connection with Mr. Deutsch’s sworn evidence
    that he was licensed to practice by the New York State Bar, there would be no
    prejudice to the defence in amending the indictment to conform with the
    evidence.”  In order to advance this
    argument, the Crown ordered the transcript of the submissions of counsel.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The additional transcript indicated that the “Federal
    courts” issue was addressed by defence counsel in argument at trial.  In the exchange between the bench and defence
    counsel on this point, it is apparent that the trial judge was not persuaded by
    the argument.  However, as already said,
    he did not address the issue in his oral reasons for judgment.  Also, as the Crown acknowledges, there was no
    discussion of the precise wording of the indictment during the course of the
    argument.  Nevertheless, the Crown
    reasserted its position as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It is
    the Crown’s position that the indictment should be amended on appeal, to
    replace the words “that he was licenced to practice law in the State of
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    New York” with the words
    “that he was licenced to practice law by the New York State Bar.”</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The
    “Federal courts” issue was addressed in argument, and the trial judge expressed
    his view then as to why the argument should fail, such that there was no
    further need for him to return to the point in the reasons for judgment.  There was no discussion of the exact wording
    of the indictment.  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The
    case otherwise hinged on the documentary evidence and whether it showed that
    Mr. Deutsch was not a member of the New York State Bar.  Defence had already made full submissions on
    the evidentiary value of the business record relied upon by the Crown at the
    time of the directed verdict motion.  Counsel’s submissions reflected an understanding that he had to meet the
    Crown’s case on the issue of “licenced by” the State of
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    New York.  Defence counsel said all that there was to say in attacking the
    inferences that could flow from the business record tendered by the Crown, in
    respect of whether Mr. Deutsch was a member of the New York State Bar.  By no means did counsel pin the case on the
    “Federal courts” issue. </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>On
    this basis, it is the Crown’s position that there would be no prejudice to the
    defence in amending the indictment on appeal to conform with the evidence, and
    that the appeal should be dismissed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In further written submissions, Mr. Deutsch pointed
    out that the disposition of his appeal has been delayed by the various requests
    for further submissions and transcript and that as of September 11, 2008, he
    had only three months of his sentence left to serve.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Hutchison, as duty counsel, filed further
    written submissions as requested.  He
    pointed out that “the distinction between Federal and State Courts and
    licensure was hardly a side issue during the course of the trial”.  He observed that the distinction between the
    two levels of court was central to the cross-examination of Mr. Younger and the
    attack on his evidence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Hutchison forcefully argued that it was
    apparent from the cross-examination of Mr. Younger, “that at least one element
    of the defence theory as it was being developed at trial was that there were
    two potential sources of authority for a licence to practice in the State of
    New York and that Mr. Younger was only capable of speaking to one of them … <i>[T]aken at</i> <i>its highest </i>Mr. Younger’s evidence could only establish that <i>his organization</i> had not provided a
    licence to practice law to Mr. Deutsch.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While I do not think that Mr. Younger testified
    in terms of his organization providing licences to practice law to eligible
    persons, the point made by Mr. Hutchison that there were two potential sources
    of authority for eligibility to practice in the State of New York is well
    taken.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Whether the court accepts the Crown’s analysis
    or duty counsel’s analysis, the result is the same – the charge as framed in
    the indictment was not established by the evidence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>What remains to consider is the Crown’s request
    to amend the indictment to conform to the evidence.  Duty counsel submits that the amendment
    sought by the Crown changes the <i>gravamen</i> of the offence by specifying a different untruth.  According to Mr. Hutchison, such an amendment
    would go beyond the scope of s. 683(1)(g).  </p>
  <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I start with the observation of Cory J. in <i>R. v. Tremblay</i> (1993), 84 C.C.C. (3d) 97
    (S.C.C.) at 114:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It is, I think, an
    extraordinary step for an appellate court to amend the charge materially and
    then to enter a conviction on the basis of the charge as amended.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I would not invoke the court’s jurisdiction to
    grant the amendment sought by the Crown.  I am not persuaded that if the amendment were made, it would necessarily
    follow that the appeal would or should be dismissed.  I say this because, in my view, the oral
    evidence of Mr. Younger and the documentary evidence of the name search,
    admitted pursuant to s. 30 of the <i>Evidence
    Act</i>, would not be sufficient to establish the guilt of Mr. Deutsch.  In this respect I agree with the “two
    potential sources of authority” submission advanced by duty counsel.  The evidence of Mr. Younger and the name
    search only addressed Mr. Deutsch’s lack of authority to practice before the
    state courts.  Such evidence did not address
    the “Federal courts” issue in a way that would support the Crown’s case.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If the amendment were made, I believe it would
    raise further questions.  What is “the New
    York State Bar”?  What evidence is there
    that such a body, if it exists, did or did not grant Mr. Deutsch a licence to
    practice law?  Mr. Younger’s evidence
    does not answer these questions.  Mr.
    Younger’s evidence speaks mainly to the registration of those who may practice
    in the state courts.  I observe that Mr.
    Younger testified that his office did not certify the good standing of attorneys
    in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    New York
    <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">
    State.  According to his evidence it is the four appellate divisions of the
    Supreme Court who have jurisdiction over the admission and discipline of
    attorneys and who certify their good standing.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the result, I would allow the appeal, set
    aside the conviction for perjury and enter an acquittal.  It is therefore unnecessary to deal with the
    sentence appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the view I take of this case, it is also
    unnecessary to deal with the issue of corroboration pursuant to s. 133 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  This issue is better left to a future
    case.  </p>
