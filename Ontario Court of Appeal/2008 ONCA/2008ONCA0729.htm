  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties, Carol Cressman Foster and Monica Furniss,
    along with Ms. Cressman Foster’s husband Peter Foster, who died on March 10,
    2001 after a tragic accident at his farm, were involved in an optometry
    practice in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Kitchener.  After Dr. Foster died, the two remaining
    optometrists could not get along together.  On December 15, 2001, Dr. Furniss left the practice and started a new
    practice about five kilometres away.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately, the rupture in the practice provoked
    wide-ranging and acrimonious litigation between Dr. Cressman Foster and Dr.
    Furniss.  Following a 29 day trial,
    Hambly J. upheld claims by each party against the other.  He also awarded damages to each party, with
    the ultimate result being a net award of $6,000 to Dr. Cressman Foster.  He declined to award costs to either party.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Again unfortunately, the parties decided not to accept
    the ‘draw’ the trial judgment essentially established.  Both parties appealed the judgment on a
    variety of grounds.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><u><span lang=EN-US>Dr. Cressman Foster’s appeal</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge held that there was an “income
    partnership” among Dr. Foster, Dr. Cressman Foster and Dr. Furniss from
    September 1, 1999 to Dr. Foster’s death in March 2001.  Dr. Cressman Foster contests this
    finding.  She contends that there was
    never a partnership involving the three optometrists.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although a full-equity partnership agreement with an
    effective date of September 1, 1999, which was being negotiated, was not signed
    before Dr. Foster’s death, we see nothing wrong with the trial judge’s
    comprehensive analysis of the many factors that cumulatively led him to
    conclude that an “income partnership” existed throughout the relationship.  In our view, on this record, it was open to
    the trial judge to conclude that the actual business relationship among the
    three practitioners bore the indicia of an income partnership, although this
    term was not used by the parties.  The
    absence of a signed partnership agreement in this case is not fatal to the
    existence of a form of partnership – an income partnership.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Contrary to Dr. Cressman Foster’s submission, this is
    not a case where the trial judge determined liability on a basis neither
    supported by the evidence nor developed at trial.  Unlike the authorities relied on by Dr.
    Cressman Foster, the central issue in this case was clear from the outset and
    throughout the entire proceeding: what was the nature of the relationship among
    the parties?  The parties led evidence
    and made submissions at trial accordingly.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Cressman Foster also appeals the ‘no costs’ award
    of the trial judge.  This is a contingent
    ground of appeal that would flow from success on the partnership issue.  Accordingly, it cannot succeed.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><u><span lang=EN-US>Dr. Furniss’ cross-appeal</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Furniss contends that the partnership continued
    after March 10, 2001 and became an equal partnership between her and Dr.
    Cressman Foster, entitling her to profits, as well as present and future
    income.  She says that her damages should
    have been around $600,000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We disagree.  The
    trial judge’s conclusion that the partnership ended with Dr. Foster’s death on
    March 10, 2001 is amply supported by the evidence he reviewed.  Hence Dr. Furniss’ claim for present and
    future income could not be sustained.  As
    well, the trial judge’s description of the partnership from September 1, 1999
    to March 10, 2001 as an “income partnership” is, as discussed above,
    supportable on the record.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Furniss contends that the trial judge erred by
    finding that she defamed Dr. Cressman Foster and in awarding general damages of
    $35,000 and aggravated damages of $20,000 to Dr. Cressman Foster.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We disagree.  Dr.
    Furniss’ unfortunate statements about Dr. Cressman Foster were clearly
    defamatory in that they were false and intended to damage her reputation.  Moreover, the general damages award is
    entitled to deference in light of the trial judge’s full review of the relevant
    factors.  The same can be said of the
    award for aggravated damages that flowed from an entirely supportable finding
    that Dr. Furniss’ statements were motivated by malice towards Dr. Cressman Foster.  We note that Dr. Furniss pleaded that the
    statements at issue were true.  At trial,
    she maintained this position and in fact denied many of the statements
    alleged.  In these circumstances, given
    the trial judge’s finding of actual malice, the aggravated damages award is
    unassailable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, Dr. Furniss appeals the no costs order of the
    trial judge on the basis that he did not take proper account of her offer to
    settle.  We disagree.  In our view, the trial judge considered Rule
    49.10 in a proper fashion and made a fair costs order in light of the divided
    success in a very long trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal and the cross-appeal are dismissed.  No costs on the appeal or the cross-appeal.</p>
