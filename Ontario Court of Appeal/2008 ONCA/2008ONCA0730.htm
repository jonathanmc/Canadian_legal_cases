    is an appeal by George Webster from a summary judgment partially dismissing
    his claim for damages against the estate of Kenneth R. Thomson, David Thomson
    and others.  The principle issue is whether the motion judge properly exercised
    her role as a judge hearing a motion under Rule 20 of the <i>Rules of Civil
    Procedure</i> in finding that there was no genuine issue for trial.  As I
    will explain, she did not.  I would, therefore, allow the appeal and order
    that Mr. Webster’s claim proceed to trial.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    painting by the American artist Charles Russell, “Pirates of the Plains”,
    had been in the Webster family since 1931.  Mr. Russell, who died in 1926,
    is well known for his paintings of the “old” American west.  He is regarded
    as
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      America</st1:country-region>
    ’s favourite western artist.  The painting was very special to Mr. Webster
    who saw it as a link to his father who passed away in 1958 and who had acquired
    the painting in 1931.  On September 29, 1982, Mr. Webster’s mother sold the
    painting to Kenneth Thomson (“Mr. Thomson”) without Mr. Webster’s knowledge
    for $150,000. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Webster asked Mr. Thomson if he could reacquire the Russell painting.  Mr.
    Thomson proposed that if Mr. Webster sold him a painting by Cornelius Krieghoff
    that he owned, Mr. Thomson would give Mr. Webster the opportunity to purchase
    the Russell painting after he died.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    proposal was contained in a letter that Mr. Thomson wrote to Mr. Webster
    on June 5, 1986.  The relevant portions of the letter read as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><i>During my lifetime I would like to enjoy ownership
      and possession of the [Russell] painting which I really do love and for
      which I have a very special feeling</i>.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>….</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>However, David [Thomson] would be happy to go along
    with my wish that, <i>if you were prepared to sell me the Krieghoff at its
    current fair market value, then on my passing the following procedure would
    take place</i> which would give you the opportunity of re-acquiring “Pirates
    of the Plains” for yourself and your family.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(1) Valuations on the painting would be obtained
    from two sources, namely Sotheby’s and an internationally recognized commercial
    gallery to be mutually agreed upon (this should not be difficult as there
    can be relatively few, such as Kennedy Galleries, that fit into this category
    and are authorities on American Western Art).</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(2) Each of these valuations would be stated as
    a range, from low to high.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(3) The two lower levels of value would be averaged.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(4) The painting would be offered to you at a price
    equal to such average of the two lower levels.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(5) <i>This offer would be open for acceptance by
      you for a period of 90 days after the two valuations are obtained</i>.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>….</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It seems to me that this would be an eminently fair
    way to handle this matter, and it would <i>give you and your family the <b>certain</b> opportunity
    of re-acquiring the painting</i> in due course – I hope not <u>too</u> soon!  [Emphasis
    added; underlining in original.]</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Webster accepted and agreed to the terms of the agreement in Mr. Thomson’s
    letter.  By a letter dated July 17, 1986, Mr. Thomson and David Thomson (“David”)
    confirmed the legally binding effect of the agreement in the June 5 letter,
    and further stated:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The agreement <i>assuring you</i> (or in the unlikely
    event of my predeceasing you, the Mr. Webster family) <i>of the opportunity
    to re-acquire
    “Pirates of the Plains”</i> is clearly outlined in our exchange of letters,
    copies of which bear the signatures of my son David and myself.  These signed
    documents, taken together, <i>are intended to be legally binding</i> and
    you and I are both satisfied that this is the case.  This letter is simply
    to reinforce the legal aspects of the signed letters <i>with the moral obligation
    David and I have undertaken to follow through exactly as we have agreed.  You
    need have no concern.  David is as honourable a person as I am.</i>  [Emphasis
    added.]</p>

    August 25, 2003, Mr. Thomson sold the Russell painting for U.S. $5.6 million.  It
    was sold by a
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    New York art dealer.  The purchaser and the painting’s whereabouts are unknown.  Mr.
    Thomson died on June 12, 2006.  Mr. Webster’s endeavours to determine his
    rights under his contract with Mr. Thomson commenced before Mr. Thomson’s
    death.  After Mr. Thomson died, David did not commence the appraisal procedure
    outlined in the June 5 letter, nor did he undertake any efforts to value
    the painting.</p>

    though by the agreement of June 5, 1986, Mr. Thomson gave Mr. Webster an
    option to purchase the painting on his death, the record disclosed that by
    2000 – 2001 he was expressing an interest in selling it.  He inquired from
    two
    <st1:PlaceName

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    New York art dealers about the painting’s value.  In July 2003, Mr. Thomson

    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    New York to one of the dealers, Lawrence Salander, for sale.  In August 2003,
    he contacted Mr. Webster to tell him that the painting was to be sold for
    U.S. $5.6 million.  Mr. Webster declined Mr. Thomson’s offer to purchase
    the painting for that price.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Webster served this claim against Kenneth Thomson, David Thomson and others
    on June 28, 2004.  Because Mr. Thomson had sold the painting, an application
    to determine the rights of the parties under the June 5, 1986 agreement was
    commenced by Mr. Webster on September 12, 2003.  On May 28, 2004, by order
    of Himel J., the application was converted into this action and pleadings
    followed.  In the action Mr. Webster claimed declaratory and other relief.  For
    the purposes of this appeal, Mr. Webster’s significant claims are for damages
    for breach of contract of $4 million and punitive damages of $10 million.  After
    Mr. Thomson died, the action was continued against his estate.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    January 10, 2008, the Estate of Kenneth Thomson, David Thomson and Thomson
    Works of Art Limited commenced their motion for summary judgment for dismissal
    of Mr. Webster’s claims.  Their principle ground for the dismissal of Mr.
    Webster’s claims reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The plaintiff, Webster, did not have the means to
    acquire the painting in issue (the “Russell Painting”) at an appraised market
    value upon the death of the late Kenneth R. Thomson (“Thomson”).  Webster
    therefore suffered no loss even if the sale of the Russell Painting prior
    to Thomason’s death was a breach of the alleged contractual right (which
    is denied) of Webster’s to acquire the Russell Painting on Thomson’s death
    at the painting’s appraised market value.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>In addition, they claimed there
    was no genuine issue for trial with respect to Mr. Webster’s claims.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    support of their motion, the respondents relied on the affidavit of David
    Binet, the executive vice-president and secretary of the Woodbridge Company
    Limited, the holding company for members of the Thomson family.  Because
    Mr. Webster’s lawyers had not responded to the Thomson lawyers’ query as
    to whether Mr. Webster had the means to purchase the Russell painting at
    fair market value if the Thomsons could arrange for him to purchase it, Mr.
    Binet inferred “that Webster did not have, at the time of Mr. Thomson’s death,
    and has not had since then the means to acquire the Russell Painting for
    its market value”.  Mr. Webster relied upon an affidavit of October 8, 2003,
    filed in respect to the earlier application, in which he said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>…Although I believe I would be able to raise the
    funds to match the American buyer’s offer either through financing or syndication,
    there is no obligation for my family to do so at this time.  I believe the
    ability to purchase the Painting at this time has nothing to do with the
    specific promise that Thomson made in the agreement, back in 1986.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>Before the motion judge, and in
    this court, Mr. Webster’s position was that he was able to raise the money,
    if necessary, to purchase the Russell painting.</p>
  <h2 align=center style='text-align:center'>IV</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    appears that the Thomsons’ motion for summary judgment was granted on the
    ground that Mr. Webster had not proved damages because he had provided no
    evidence that he could raise the money to purchase the Russell painting.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>With
    respect to the damage issue and Mr. Webster’s ability to purchase the painting,
    the motion judge said at paras. 5 –
    8:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The evidence with respect to damages is scanty to
    say the least.  Defence has deposed that the painting was essentially purchased
    for $150,000 and was sold for $5.6 million in 2003, but only $2 million of
    that amount was paid.  Apparently the balance is alleged to be outstanding.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>As Mr. Thomson died in 2006, one can infer and assume
    that in the absence of any contrary evidence, the painting had a value of
    at least $2 million dollars on his death.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><i>Plaintiff has put forward no evidence to support
      that he was ready, willing, and able to exercise the option to purchase
      the painting at that or any other price; rather he maintains someone, presumably
      not he, has to first establish a price in [sic] the method set out in the
      agreement</i>.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>With respect to the plaintiff’s ability to pay,
    he simply states he could have financed or syndicated the purchase.  Insofar
    as raising funds in that fashion depends on third parties being prepared
    to advance those funds, no supporting evidence has been led in that regard.  [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    some observations in which she seemed to consider Mr. Webster’s claim as
    one for loss of opportunity, the motion judge continued at paras. 10, 14-15
    and 19:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I have considered whether or not this matter should
    be directed to go to trial on the issue of whether there was a <i>reasonable
    probability that plaintiff was able to purchase the painting</i>, however,
    assuming the plaintiff has put his best foot forward, the lack of evidence
    in that regard precludes such finding.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>….</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><i>In the end, the onus is on the plaintiff to prove
      his damages and on the material before me, assuming it would be the evidence
      at trial, he has failed to do so and there is no triable issue raised in
      that regard</i>.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>He has not shown he has lost anything (the purchase
    option) that he could or would have performed, or raised a triable issue
    in that regard.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>….</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In the end, breach of contract has been admitted,
    no damages proved, and it is open to the court to make a nominal award.  The
    quantum of that nominal amount is directed to go to trial along with any
    issue with respect to punitive damages.  Passing mention was made of whether
    or not they can be claimed in the event of nominal damages only, and I direct
    that the issue of entitlement in fact or law and quantum with respect to
    punitive damages also go to trial.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <h2 align=center style='text-align:center'>V</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Like
    any other case in which the court has granted summary judgment dismissing
    a plaintiff’s claim, the issue is whether the motion judge erred in finding
    that there was no genuine issue for trial.  A broader issue is whether the
    motion judge exceeded her role in the hearing of a Rule 20 motion and took
    on the mantle of a trial judge in deciding that Mr. Webster’s action could
    not succeed because he did not prove that he had the means to purchase the
    painting for $2 million.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    is not a complex case.  Mr. Webster’s position is that Mr. Thomson’s death
    triggered his contractual right to an option to acquire the Russell painting
    at its market value.  This is admitted for the purpose of their motion by
    the respondents, who further admit that Mr. Thomson had breached the contract
    about three years before he died by selling the painting to an unknown purchaser
    through a
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    <st1:place

    market value of the painting by the procedure in the June 5, 1986 agreement.  Unless
    the Thomsons were to reacquire the painting before trial, the ninety days
    that Mr. Webster would have had under the agreement to exercise his option
    is irrelevant.  Therefore, the only remaining issue would be the amount of
    Mr. Webster’s damages.  The amount of damages is not a proper consideration
    on a Rule 20 motion to dismiss a claim based on a breach of contract.  There
    was no need, as the motion judge thought, for Mr. Webster to prove his damages
    at this stage of the proceeding.</p>

    my view, the motion judge assumed the role of a trial judge.  Even though
    the valuation procedure had not been carried out, she decided that to prevent
    the summary disposition of his action Mr. Webster had to demonstrate that
    he had the means to purchase the painting.  She also believed Mr. Webster
    had an obligation to present evidence of the painting’s market value.  She
    appears to have assumed a minimum value of $2 million on Mr. Thomson’s death
    in 2006, based on the first, and only, instalment that the purchaser paid
    for it in 2003.  This, in my view, was not proper evidence of the valuation
    of a work of art.  In any event, the contract contained the procedure for
    the valuation of the painting.  Moreover, much of this was pure speculation
    as the respondents provided no evidence of the painting’s value on the death
    of Mr. Thomson, or of the respondent’s likelihood of being able to reacquire
    the painting from its unknown purchaser to enable Mr. Webster to exercise
    his option.</p>

    ) at para. 9, this court succinctly set out the onus resting on the parties
    on a motion for summary judgment:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The authorities are clear that the onus is on the
    moving party to establish that there is no genuine issue for trial with respect
    to a claim or defence.  There is no onus on the responding party.  However,
    where the evidence presented by the moving party <i>prima facie</i> establishes
    that there is no genuine issue for trial, and the moving party is entitled
    to summary judgment as a matter of law, to preclude the granting of summary
    judgment the responding party assumes the evidentiary burden of presenting
    evidence which is capable of supporting the position advanced by the responding
    party in its pleading.  On the basis of this evidence, when considered with
    all the evidence before the motions judge, it will then be for the motions
    judge to determine whether the evidentiary record raises a genuine issue
    for trial.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this case, based on the materials filed by the respondents, it cannot be
    said that there were no genuine issues for trial or that they were entitled
    to summary judgment as a matter of law.  The legal issue presented by the
    respondents, as I understand it, was this: If a defendant breaches a contract
    providing an option to purchase property at what amounts to a fixed price
    by making it impossible for the plaintiff to exercise the option, in order
    to succeed must the plaintiff show that he would have had the means to exercise
    the option?  The motion judge found at para. 10 that Mr. Webster could not
    succeed in his claim against the respondents unless “there was a reasonable
    probability that [he] was able to purchase the painting”.  She said he provided
    no evidence that he could finance the purchase.  It was wrong for the motion
    judge to say that Mr. Webster had provided no evidence that he could purchase
    the painting; he said he believed he could raise the funds.  Mr. Webster
    was not required, as the motion judge thought, to produce evidence from prospective
    lenders.  Moreover, his statement that he could raise the funds was uncontradicted.  Even
    if the motion judge was correct as a matter of law, it would be unreasonable
    to expect Mr. Webster to provide evidence that he could raise an unknown
    sum to exercise the option.  Moreover, as the respondents assigned no value
    to the painting, there was no way Mr. Webster could establish that he had
    the means to buy it, even if he was legally required to do so.  In any event,
    the respondents provided no evidence that Mr. Webster could not raise the
    phantom funds.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is a fundamental principle that a person cannot benefit from his or her breach
    of contract.  In this case, Mr. Thomson breached an enforceable contract.  He
    could not perform the contract as a result of its breach.  In my view, Mr.
    Thomson cannot benefit from this breach.  Yet he clearly does so based on
    the motion judge’s findings.  This is a further reason why her judgment must
    be set aside.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondents provided two cases which they say support the motion judge’s
    conclusion that Mr. Webster could not succeed in his claim against the Thomsons
    as “there was no reasonable probability that [he] was able to purchase the
    painting”.  In my view, both cases are factually quite different from the
    present case and thus cannot be said to be determinative of the issues.</p>

      v. Hyman</i>, [1939] S.C.R. 364, the issue was whether the defendant had
      made it impossible for the plaintiff to exercise an option to purchase
      a number of shares arising from a rather complex commercial agreement by
      failing to call a shareholders meeting to ratify a share transfer.  There
      was no issue about whether the plaintiff had the means to exercise the
      option.  The issue in the case was whether the breach of the option agreement
      gave rise to nominal or substantial damages.  The Supreme Court of Canada
      held that because the evidence showed that it was extremely doubtful that
      the ratification would be approved by a majority of the shareholders, the
      plaintiff was entitled to nominal damages.  The issue in <i>Kinkel</i> was,
      therefore, different from the issue in this case.</p>

    ) the issue also did not concern the plaintiff’s financial ability to exercise
    an option.  The issue, as in <i>Kinkel</i>, was whether the plaintiff was
    entitled to nominal or substantial damages on the basis of the plaintiff’s
    loss of a chance of obtaining a benefit had the contract in issue been performed.</p>

    slightly differently, what the respondents are saying is that to avoid summary
    judgment dismissing his claim, Mr. Webster was required to show that he was
    ready, willing and able to perform the contract by purchasing the Russell
    painting.  This ignores the first step that Mr. Webster must take before
    he reaches this position – to show that he had an enforceable option.  The
    respondents, whose entire position throughout has been to extricate themselves
    from a bad situation, would therefore probably say that Mr. Webster would
    have to show that he was ready, willing and able to exercise the option.</p>

    the case of a contract for the purchase and sale of goods, where the covenants
    of the parties are concurrent, neither party can recover against the other
    without proving that he or she either has performed his or her obligations,
    or is ready and willing to so perform: <i>Sherkin v. Winchell</i> (1982),
    37 O.R. (2d) 97 (C.A.).  However, where a buyer, before the breach of a contract
    for the sale of goods, repudiates it, and that repudiation is accepted and
    acted on by the seller, the seller is relieved from the performance of all
    conditions precedent, including the condition of being ready and willing
    at the date of repudiation to deliver the goods: <i>British and Beningtons,
    Ltd. v. North Western Cachar Tea Co., Ltd.</i>, [1923] A.C. 48 (H. L.).  This
    would also apply where a seller repudiates a contract.  However, Professor
    Fridman is of the view that in England and Canada, in the context not of
    a concurrent or anterior obligation but of a repudiation prior to the time
    at which performance is due, the issue of whether the complaining party must
    establish that he was ready, willing and able to perform his own obligations,
    not withstanding the repudiation of the contract, is unresolved: G.H.L. Fridman, <i>The
    Law of Contract in Canada</i> (Toronto: Thomson Canada Limited, 2006) at
    pp. 550-551.</p>

    have located one case that deals with option agreements.  It was an action
    for specific performance of an option agreement.  In <i>Boxer v. Norvan Properties
    Ltd.</i> (1986), 33 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 150 (B.C.S.C.), the plaintiffs
    notified the defendant he was exercising an option that he had acquired to
    purchase 50,000 shares of a particular company.  In an action to enforce
    the option, the defendant’s position was that more was required to exercise
    an option than notice.  The defendant contended that the plaintiff was also
    required to tender the purchase price.  The trial judge disagreed and held
    that the plaintiffs had properly exercised the option.  At p. 153, he said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The next question is whether the option was properly
    exercised so as to turn it into a binding contract without the tender of
    purchase price for the shares.  I have not had referred to me any cases dealing
    with the purchase of chattels which require formal tender of the money at
    the time of exercising the option.  The cases dealing with real estate options
    and tender with respect to them, in my view, are not helpful when dealing
    with chattels.  If tender is normally made, the circumstances of each case
    must be looked at to see whether it is reasonable that it be made.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>The trial judge concluded that in
    the circumstances of the case, it would have been fruitless to tender any
    money until the court determined that the option was exercisable.  He held
    that should the defendant not complete the sale, the case should come back
    before him for an order for specific performance or to assess damages.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>An
    appeal to the British Columbia Court of Appeal was dismissed: (1988), 52
    D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 667.  The above issue was not before the court.  On
    the only issue before it, the court decided that the option had been exercised
    within a reasonable time.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    I understand <i>Boxer</i>, it stands for the principle that whether payment
    must be tendered in order to exercise an option will depend on whether it
    would be reasonable to do so in the circumstances of each case.  Applying
    this principle to this case, it would clearly be unreasonable for Mr. Webster
    to be expected to tender the purchase price of the painting because the price
    was not known.  This is because there had been no compliance with the valuation
    procedure in the June 5, 1986 agreement that required, upon Mr. Thomson’s
    death, that two valuations of the Russell painting be obtained.  Moreover,
    the defendants, as I have said, should not be able to take advantage of Mr.
    Thomson’s breach of the contract.  </p>
