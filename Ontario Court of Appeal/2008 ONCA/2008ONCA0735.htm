  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s principal ground of appeal from his convictions for assault,
    assault with a knife and uttering a death threat is an allegation that he
    received ineffective assistance of counsel at his trial.  The appellant also
    submits that the trial judge erred in excluding certain defence evidence,
    misapprehending important Crown evidence, and using inadmissible hearsay
    for the truth of its contents.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the following reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>INTRODUCTION:  THE
      COURT’S APPROACH TO INEFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE OF COUNSEL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An
    appeal based upon alleged ineffective assistance of counsel has a performance
    component and a prejudice component. For an appeal to succeed, the appellant
    must show “that counsel’s acts or omissions constituted incompetence and
    second, that a miscarriage of justice resulted”:  <i>R. v. G.D.B.</i> (2000),
    143 C.C.C. (3d) 289 (S.C.C.), at para. 26.  The test for establishing incompetence
    is a strict one; the appellant must show that the acts or omissions of counsel
    could not “have been the result of reasonable professional judgment”:  <i>G.D.B.</i>, at
    para. 27.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    approach laid down by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>G.D.B.</i> requires
    this court to first determine whether a miscarriage of justice has occurred.  If
    not, the performance component will not need to be considered.  In <i>G.D.B.</i>,
    the court suggested two ways in which counsel’s performance may have resulted
    in a miscarriage of justice: procedural unfairness or an unreliable verdict.  An
    example of procedural unfairness is where counsel failed to obtain instructions
    before embarking on a course of defence in circumstances where counsel was
    bound to obtain instructions.  The unreliability of the verdict is made out
    where the appellant can establish that there is a reasonable probability
    that the verdict would have been different had the appellant received effective
    legal representation:  <i>R. v. Davies</i>, 2008 ONCA 209, at para. 37:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[O]ur initial
    task is to consider the record, as augmented by the fresh evidence, to determine
    whether the appellant was prejudiced by reason of his counsel’s alleged incompetence.
    To succeed in that regard, the appellant must establish either that there
    is a reasonable probability that the verdicts would have been different had
    he received effective legal representation, or that his counsel’s conduct
    deprived him of a fair trial: see <i>R. v. G.D.B.</i>, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 520.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    pursuing the ineffective assistance of counsel ground of appeal, appeal counsel
    has gathered considerable material including trial counsel’s entire file,
    which relates to the criminal trial and the divorce.  Trial counsel, Arthur
    Sidney Pollack, represented the appellant for both proceedings.  Mr. Pollack
    was examined and cross-examined by appellate counsel over seven days.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant makes a number of allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel
    against trial counsel.  He submits that counsel’s understanding of the law
    was profoundly deficient and that this lack of legal knowledge, especially
    about the principles of recent fabrication, admissibility of prior consistent
    statements, the collateral fact rule and the permissible limits of examination
    and cross-examination, impacted on the trial.  Further, counsel had available
    evidence that he could have led at trial that would have undermined the credibility
    of the complainant and bolstered the credibility of the appellant, but he
    did not lead this evidence.  He submits that counsel’s incompetence deprived
    him of a fair trial and that the verdict is unreliable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
    of the nature of the allegations it is necessary to examine in considerable
    detail every facet of the trial.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the discussion below, I refer to the various parts of the trial and relate
    them to the trial judge’s reasons and the fresh evidence.  I also make some
    brief reference to trial counsel’s explanations for the steps he took.  It
    should be borne in mind that counsel was cross-examined in 2007, over four
    years after the trial.  Further, counsel was almost 69 years of age in 2007,
    and it is apparent that he was having difficulties with his health during
    the examination.  In general, I did not find his explanations for his actions
    before and during the trial very helpful.  He readily conceded his failings
    during examination by counsel for the appellant, but then just as easily
    adopted alternative explanations offered during cross-examination by Crown
    counsel. </p>

    allegations against the appellant relate to his wife, Shelina Salehmohamed.  While
    evidence was led of a number of incidents, the Crown relied upon an incident
    in August 1999 as the basis for the charges of assault with a weapon and
    threatening death, and an incident in November 1999 for the assault charge.  </p>

    appellant and the complainant met in late 1997 or early 1998 through friends
    at a mosque that they both attended.  They married in June 1999.  At the
    time, the complainant was a pharmacist and the appellant was completing his
    studies to be a physician.  The day following their marriage, the couple
    moved into a condominium apartment.  Below, I have set out a summary of the
    events covered at the trial, together with the findings made by the trial
    judge, the allegation of incompetence, and the fresh evidence relating to
    that allegation.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The

line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant testified that she was surprised to find that the condominium
    had no furniture.  She claimed that the appellant told her that in Islam
    a bed, utensils or a dining table were not needed.  As a result, she slept
    on an air mattress for 6 to 8 weeks before a bed arrived.  The appellant
    gave no evidence about furniture in the apartment. </p>
  <p class=StyleHeading3Italic align=left style='text-align:left'>The Trial Judge’s
    Reasons</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge referred to the complainant’s evidence about the lack of furniture
    as part of her review of the complainant’s testimony.</p>
  <p class=StyleHeading3Italic align=left style='text-align:left'>The Fresh Evidence</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    trial counsel’s file was a receipt showing that a bed and double-sized luxury
    mattress had been purchased 16 days after the couple moved into the condominium,
    but was not paid for until 23 days after the marriage.  The documents do
    not show when the bed was delivered.  There was no fresh evidence from the
    appellant as to when the bed was delivered, nor why he waited over two weeks
    before ordering the bed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Trial
    counsel acknowledged that it was an oversight not to have confronted the
    complainant with the receipt.  However, he did not consider it to be a serious
    oversight because he had led this evidence through the appellant.  In fact,
    he had not done so.</p>

line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant testified that sometime before they were married, the appellant
    told her that the house at 55 Chapletown, where he lived with his parents
    and sister, was his.  He stated that he was paying the mortgage on the house,
    and that they would live there once they were married.  However, she did
    not want to live with his parents and so they moved into the condominium.  Shortly
    after the marriage, however, she began asking about the house at 55 Chapletown,
    and the appellant said that it was not his house, that it belonged to his
    father.  She therefore asked her father, a lawyer, to do a property search.  According
    to her, the property search disclosed that a few days before the marriage,
    the appellant had transferred ownership from his name to his father’s name.  She
    testified that the house had been in the appellant’s name alone before the
    transfer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant testified that she was afraid to discuss the matter with the
    appellant, for fear that he would throw things and grab her, but she decided
    she had to.  In August 1999, she asked the appellant if there was anything
    he needed to tell her about the house.  He said no, but she continued to
    press the matter and finally told him that she knew he had transferred the
    house.  The appellant became very angry, saying that she was just a woman
    and had no right to question him.  He started to hit the wall.  The appellant
    then grabbed the complainant, pushed her up against the wall, and tried to
    punch her.  He ended up hitting the wall instead, making dents and holes.  He
    then took a knife from the kitchen and held it up to her neck.  He said to
    her:  “You’re ruining my life.  You know Shelina, I’m a doctor.  I know every
    part of the human body.  You know what I’m capable of doing to you.”  He
    said that he wanted to kill her and himself.  He also said that she was “untraditional
    in Islamic for questioning him”.  She apologized and said she would be more
    Islamic.  He then left the apartment.  She testified in chief that she had
    bruises on her neck but did not show them to anyone.  She called her parents
    and told them what had happened, but said she was alright and for them not
    to come over.  There was no objection by trial counsel to the complainant
    testifying to the contents of her conversation with her father.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    night, the appellant called her from his office at
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Toronto General

    Hospital and asked her to meet him at
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    College Park.  He said everything would be fine, that they needed to talk.  However,
    when she arrived he grabbed her again, telling her that she was ruining his
    life.  He said she was a bad woman and
    “unIslamic”.  Eventually, they went back to the condominium where she slept
    in the bed and he slept on the couch.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    next day, after the appellant had gone to work, the complainant’s father,
    brother and a friend of her brother, Randall Thorne, came to the apartment.  They
    saw the damage, and her father said he could not leave her there.  She decided
    to go with her father, and ended up staying at her parents’ home for about
    a week.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    counsel cross-examined the complainant on whether any of her co-workers noticed
    anything.  She testified that on one occasion someone noticed some marks,
    and that one of her co-workers thought it was a hickey.  The complainant
    laughed it off because she did not know what to do.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant had quite a different version of this incident.  He testified in
    chief that upon arriving home late from work one day, the complainant began
    yelling at him, using foul language, complaining that he never took her anywhere,
    and did not buy her flowers like her father did for her mother.  The appellant
    eventually left, and returned to his office at the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Toronto General
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Hospital.  He stayed there for a few hours before returning to the condominium.  The
    complainant was asleep in the bedroom so he slept on the sofa.  He went to
    work in the morning but when he returned that evening the complainant was
    gone and the apartment was in shambles.  Various wedding gifts were on the
    floor and there were some holes in the wall.  As well, the couple’s wedding
    invitation had been ripped up.  The appellant testified that he was in shock
    and tried to reach his parents.  When he could not find them, he called his
    aunt.  At some point, the complainant’s father called him and used abusive
    language.  The appellant assumed that the complainant must have been with
    her parents.  The appellant denied using a knife or threatening to kill the
    complainant or harm himself.</p>

line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    cross-examination, the appellant was asked whether he had ever discussed
    the home at 55 Chapletown with the complainant.  At first he denied it, but
    then admitted that the complainant did bring up the subject of his transferring
    title to his father before the marriage.  He could not remember exactly when
    she brought it up except that it was in August or September.  When she brought
    it up she was screaming at him, using foul language, and throwing things.  He
    denied that he was angry at her for having searched the title.  </p>

line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    cross-examination, the appellant explained that 55 Chapletown was his father’s
    home, and that his name had been on the deed to assist his father in getting
    a mortgage.  However, when he was about to get married and the couple was
    not going to live at the house, there was no reason for his name to be on
    the property.</p>

    appellant was cross-examined on what he did when he came home and found the
    condominium in disarray.  In particular, he was questioned about why he did

    the appellant had threatened to kill her and had beaten her.  When he arrived
    at the apartment he saw that the complainant was crying.  She looked distraught
    and dishevelled.  She told him that she had a problem with the appellant
    over money.  The appellant had accused her of hiding money, and she had confronted
    him about transferring the house to his father’s name before they were married.  The
    complainant showed him the holes in the wall that were caused when the appellant
    attempted to hit her.  She told him that the appellant had threatened to
    kill her, and had put a knife to her throat.  In direct examination, the
    father was asked whether he had called the police.  He said that he had not
    because the complainant wanted the marriage to work.  He was also concerned
    that a complaint to the police would seriously affect the appellant’s profession.  There
    was no objection to any of the father’s testimony of what the complainant
    told him.</p>

    then transferred into the appellant’s father’s name alone a few days before

    that it was her decision.  He was then confronted with his testimony at the

    counsel cross-examined the complainant on whether she went with the appellant

    she may have done so.  She was then asked if she recalled having an argument

    counsel called Tahira Devji as a defence witness.  She is 12 years old and
    the appellant’s cousin.  Counsel asked her if she recalled an incident in
    the summer break of 1999 when she went on a car ride with the appellant and
    the complainant.  She replied “yes”.  Crown counsel then objected on the
    basis that counsel was trying “to prove a collateral fact apparently”.  Trial
    counsel said that he was attempting to show “the nature of the complainant”.  The
    trial judge asked counsel if this related to any of the “car incidents that
    we’ve heard about in this trial”.  Counsel said it had not yet been mentioned.  Trial
    counsel explained that the complainant had portrayed herself as a non-violent
    person and this incident would show
    “that she is capable of some type of violence”.  Crown counsel then reminded
    the court that the complainant had been cross-examined about an ice cream
    trip but took the position that it was,
    “Collateral, completely collateral.”  The following interchange then took
    place:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The Court:  If
    it has to do with an incident that doesn’t concern any other incidents testified
    to by either the accused or the complainant, then how is it relevant? It’s

    in this case.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Trial counsel: Well,
    my friend was allowed a wide degree of latitude in his cross-examination,
    going through the whole divorce proceeding. That’s certainly collateral to
    this issue.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The Court:  Well,
    that’s the difficulty with this trial. This is not the divorce trial, and
    many of the references to the divorce are clearly irrelevant to the criminal
    matter before this Court, so to the extent that he was given any latitude
    in the divorce trial, the Rules of Evidence in the criminal courts are very
    different and –</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Trial counsel:

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Trial counsel:  Fine.

    had waited a few weeks he could have obtained an uncontested divorce on the
    basis of one-year separation.  The complainant filed a counter petition in
    November, also seeking a divorce on the basis of cruelty.  Trial counsel
    cross-examined the complainant about the counter petition and suggested that

    returned to the divorce issue, however.  She testified that the appellant
    filed the petition based on cruelty to attempt to demean her in the community
    and to say that she was a bad wife.  She also claimed that there was a lot
    of stigma in her community about divorce.</p>

    counsel also cross-examined the appellant on the fact that he could have
    obtained a divorce based on separation if he had waited one more month before
    issuing the petition.  The appellant testified that he was trying to expedite
    things because he was being harassed by the complainant’s father in telephone
    calls.  The complainant’s father was abusing him verbally, but also urging
    him to get back together with the complainant.  The appellant also testified
    that he was unaware of this way to get a divorce before he filed his petition.  He
    then testified that, in fact, the divorce was granted on the basis of separation.  Crown
    counsel then cross-examined the appellant on the reasons of the judge who
    granted the divorce to demonstrate that the divorce was based on the allegations
    of cruelty by the complainant in the counter petition.  He read the reasons
    to the appellant who replied that there was a lot of lingo and that he relied

    counsel also engaged in cross-examination of the appellant on the “Maher” or
    marriage contract.  The appellant said that he signed a Maher in which he
    agreed to give his wife $10,000 if they divorced.  He agreed that the family
    court judge gave judgment against him for this amount and he paid it.  He
    was also asked about the Hindu custom of “sati” in which a wife commits suicide
    at her husband’s cremation.  He denied discussing this with the complainant.  Trial

    divorce so quickly.  The appellant again talked about the abuse from the
    complainant’s father, and added that he had also called the appellant’s father
    and aunt.  Then, the following took place:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Trial counsel:   But,

    counsel agreed that he had not given the appellant a copy of the transcript
    of the divorce proceeding in preparation for the trial.  He agreed that this
    was an oversight on his behalf.  Trial counsel testified that although he
    did not see the relevance of Crown counsel’s cross-examination on the Maher
    and sati, because it was cross-examination he believed the Crown was entitled
    to ask the questions.  He also did not think the cross-examination was prejudicial.  Counsel

    that he did confront the appellant at the mosque about his abuse of the complainant
    and his abusive language.  According to the father, the appellant told him
    to go away, and he complied.  He was later charged with assault.  The father
    in turn charged the appellant’s aunt and male cousin for threatening to kill
    him.  The cousin had told the father that he was a member of a Sri Lankan
    gang.  It is unclear if this incident occurred at the same time as the alleged
    assault by the father on the appellant.  The father confirmed that the charges

    the complainant’s parents with assault.  In cross-examination, trial counsel
    suggested to the complainant that the reason she went to the police was because
    the appellant had laid these charges.  She denied this.  She said that the
    reason she had the courage to go to the police was because the appellant
    was following through with his vendetta against her and her family, his promise
    that he would ruin her life and her parents’ lives, and that he would kill

    counsel had in his file receipts showing that 16 days after the marriage
    he purchased a bed, and that the bed was fully paid for 23 days after the
    marriage.  It is argued that this evidence could have been used to undermine
    the complainant’s claim that she slept on an air mattress for six weeks,
    and that the appellant was attempting to impose upon her a strict form of
    Islam.  However, the appellant has adduced no evidence on the appeal as to
    when the bed or any other furniture was delivered.  The appellant has therefore
    not shown that the failure to adduce this evidence would have contradicted
    the complainant’s claim at trial.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According
    to the complainant, the first assault in August was sparked when she confronted
    the appellant with the fact that he had transferred ownership of the house
    at 55 Chapletown.  She testified that at her request her father had searched
    the title and discovered that days before the wedding the appellant had transferred
    title to his father.  The complainant refused to concede that in fact that
    property had been jointly owned by the appellant and his father.  The appellant’s
    explanation for the transfer was that his name was only on the property for
    mortgage purposes, and since he did not intend to live there after the marriage,
    he transferred his interest to his father.  Trial counsel had a copy of the
    documents in his file to show that the property had indeed been in the name
    of the appellant and his father, but he failed to confront the complainant
    with this material.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    by the end of the trial there could be no serious dispute that the property
    had been in the name of both the appellant and his father.  The complainant’s
    father, who had actually done the title search, confirmed this.  To the extent
    that the pre-marriage state of title was important, it was established.  </p>

    indicated, trial counsel had in his file a photograph of a bruise on the
    appellant’s arm.  Trial counsel did not use the photograph at the preliminary
    inquiry or at the trial but made some reference to it at the preliminary
    inquiry, the suggestion being that the bruise resulted from the assault by
    the complainant’s mother.  The photograph is undated and there is no evidence
    from the appellant as to when the photograph was taken or by whom.  In the
    absence of such evidence it is impossible to tell whether the photograph
    has any probative value, and therefore to find that failure to produce the
    photograph at the trial affected the reliability of the verdict.  In any
    event, even if the photograph could be tied to the assault, the failure to
    produce it could not have affected the verdict.  The complainant’s mother
    was not a witness.  Although the complainant was cross-examined about the
    assault, she was not present at the mosque.  Her belief that the appellant,
    by charging her parents, was carrying out his plan to ruin her life and the
    life of her parents was not dependent on whether or not her mother actually
    assaulted the appellant.</p>

    is no doubt that trial counsel could have called evidence to show that the
    appellant was of good character.  This is apparent from the fact that counsel
    had a number of character letters that were used on sentencing.  However,
    evidence of good character was of limited value in this case.  There is no
    suggestion that the proposed character evidence would have shed light on
    the way in which the appellant interacted with the complainant in private.  In <i>R.
    v. Profit</i>, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 637, the Supreme Court of Canada observed,
    at p. 637, that “sexual misconduct occurs in private and in most cases will
    not be reflected in the reputation in the community of the accused for morality”.  The
    same may be said in this case.  The physical abuse to which the complainant
    testified took place when she was alone with the appellant.  </p>

    the evidence was inadmissible.</p>

    position that there was no noise emanating from his apartment.  To the contrary,

    Devji had given the evidence sought and had been believed, this would have
    contradicted the complainant’s father on a relatively minor matter.  There
    was abundant other evidence that the complainant’s father was not an independent

    appellant submits that trial counsel profoundly misunderstood the law of
    recent fabrication.  As a result, counsel unwittingly made an allegation
    of recent fabrication by alleging that the complainant went to the police
    in response to her parents being charged. This allegation paved the way for
    admission of what would otherwise have been inadmissible evidence of the
    complainant’s prior consistent statements.  In my view, some kind of allegation
    of recent fabrication was inevitable in this case.  The one piece of independent
    physical evidence in this case was the holes or dents in the wall.  They
    were seen by two people, Mr. Thorne and Mr. Aruliah, who had no motive to
    fabricate.  For the appellant to raise a reasonable doubt as to whether the
    August incident occurred, he had to discredit the version of events from
    the complainant as to how that damage occurred.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defence strategy at trial was to demonstrate that the complainant was not
    credible because her version of events, even as supported by the other Crown
    witnesses, was inherently unlikely.  For example, despite the violence and
    threats that were said to have accompanied the August incident, neither the
    complainant nor her father called the police, and no independent witness
    saw the bruises that should have been apparent from the assault.  This attempt
    was somewhat undermined when the complainant testified that a co-worker had
    seen a bruise which she referred to as a “hickey”.  On the other hand, the
    Crown made no attempt to call this co-worker.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[118]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defence position was bolstered by the fact that despite the serious violence
    reported by the complainant, she not only returned to the relationship a
    few days later but her father, who had “zero tolerance”
    for violence, eventually conceded in cross-examination that he had persuaded
    her to return.  It could be argued that the explanation that the complainant
    still wanted the marriage to work in the face of the extreme violence described
    by the complainant in her testimony, and as reported to her father, was incredible.  Counsel
    was also able to discredit the complainant because although she claimed that
    the appellant had threatened to kill her parents, she never told them about
    the threats until well after the threats were allegedly made.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[119]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    was a reasonable tactic in the circumstances, but it necessarily depended
    on the complainant and her father relating the entire chronology, including
    the history of complaints by the complainant to her father.  It was only
    through an examination of this chronology that it could be argued that the
    complainant must have exaggerated what the appellant did.  Otherwise why
    did she return to him, why did her father persuade her to return, and why
    did she not tell her father of the death threats?  The only downside of this
    strategy was that it made Mr. Thorne’s evidence of what the complainant said
    to her father admissible.  On the other hand, this was a relatively minor
    risk.  The complainant told a story of extreme violence, including attempts
    to punch her and the holding of a knife to her throat.  Mr. Thorne merely
    testified that the complainant said the appellant threatened her.  He saw
    no bruises, made no mention of attempts by the appellant to assault the complainant,
    and made no mention of the use of a knife.  Finally, Mr. Thorne’s description
    of the damage was minor compared to the picture presented by the complainant
    and her father.  On balance, it was reasonable to view Mr. Thorne’s evidence
    as not inconsistent with the defence theory.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[120]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    second theme that emerges from the trial is that the complainant’s report
    to the police was a reaction to her parents being charged with assault, and
    not a response to actual abuse.  The theory was a reasonable one given the
    chronology.  This theory also depended on an exploration of the chronology
    and what the complainant told her father.  On the other hand, it could be
    that the strategy was nothing more than an attempt to show that the complainant’s

    appellant submits that the verdict is unreliable because counsel failed to
    object to inadmissible evidence including hearsay evidence, prior consistent
    statements, and irrelevant evidence.  For reasons set out above, it is my
    view that the prior consistent statements were admissible.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[122]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    to the hearsay evidence, the most problematic evidence was from Mr. Aruliah
    that he had received complaints from the appellant’s neighbours of a screaming
    woman in distress.  This evidence was admissible for the limited purpose
    of explaining why Mr.&nbsp;Aruliah went to the apartment.  The evidence was
    not tendered as proof that there were complaints from other neighbours.  In
    a jury trial, a trial judge might well find that the prejudicial effect of
    the evidence outweighed its probative value and exclude it.  In other words,
    the risk that the jury would use it for its truth as evidence that there
    was screaming coming from the apartment (the prejudicial effect) would outweigh
    its value in explaining Mr. Aruliah’s conduct (the probative value). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[123]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    this was a judge alone trial and thus the issue is whether the trial judge
    misused the evidence.  In her reasons, the trial judge reviewed Mr. Aruliah’s
    evidence and referred to the fact that he had received “numerous complaints
    of screaming and knocking down noises from Apartment 1207, and he observed
    the complainant leaving the building a few times crying”.  However, when
    the trial judge came to her analysis of the evidence and, in particular,
    the credibility of the complainant’s evidence, she did not refer to this
    evidence.  Finally, even if it was used for its truth, this hearsay evidence
    was not inconsistent with the appellant’s version of events.  He claimed
    that he was constantly verbally abused for no reason by the complainant.  For
    example, the appellant testified as follows in relation to the August incident:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I can’t remember
    exactly what happened, what she said at that time, but it was the same thing
    again, screaming, shouting, foul language again, and I – there was one incident,
    I don’t know if it was that time, but when she took off her ring and she
    threw it against the wall.  I can’t remember if it was that time because
    she threw things on [<i>sic</i>] times.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[124]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also submits that trial counsel should have objected to the evidence
    of the complainant as to her conversation with her mother in which the appellant
    appeared to make an admission following the Future Shop incident.  Crown
    counsel did not rely upon this evidence in his submissions and the trial
    judge did not refer to this incident.  It is reasonable to assume that the
    trial judge recognized this testimony for what it was: inadmissible hearsay.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[125]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that because of trial counsel’s mistaken understanding
    of the scope of cross-examination, Crown counsel was permitted to cross-examine
    the appellant on irrelevant evidence.  He points in particular to the cross-examination
    of the appellant on the Maher and the Hindu tradition of Sati.  Cross-examination
    on these issues was irrelevant and counsel should have objected.  On the
    other hand, I fail to see how the cross-examination prejudiced the appellant.  The
    cross-examination consisted of a few questions and played no part in the
    trial judge’s assessment of the appellant’s credibility.  For example, with
    respect to the Maher, the appellant acknowledged that the complainant obtained
    judgment against him in the divorce proceedings for the amount of the Maher,
    and testified that he had paid the judgment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    appellant submits that trial counsel should have objected to cross-examination
    on the Port Perry incident.  In my view, cross-examination on this incident
    was not improper.  The appellant attempted to portray himself as a mild mannered,
    much abused husband.  His defence was that it was the complainant who initiated
    all the arguments and she was the one who was initiating the attempts at
    reconciliation.  It was open to Crown counsel to challenge the appellant’s
    version of events, even if the Crown did not rely on this incident during
    its case in chief.  In the result, the court heard only the appellant’s version
    of this event, which entirely favoured the defence position.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[127]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that trial counsel should have led the appellant in chief
    through each of the incidents to obtain his explanation for each of them,
    and not just the August incident.  I agree that trial counsel should have
    at least obtained the appellant’s version of the Future Shop incident, since
    that was the basis for the assault charge.  The issue, however, is whether
    the failure to do so affected the reliability of the verdict.  Trial counsel
    did obtain from the appellant his express denial that he assaulted or threatened
    the complainant.  And, in cross-examination, the appellant was given the
    opportunity to provide his version of all of the events.  For some, like
    the Edwards Garden incident, the appellant simply denied that there was such
    an incident.</p>
  <p class=StyleHeading3Italic align=left style='text-align:left'>Use of the

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[128]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that trial counsel did not use the preliminary inquiry
    transcript effectively because his method was to read long passages from
    the transcript that were generally not inconsistent with the witness’s trial
    testimony.  I agree that trial counsel should have been more precise in his
    use of the transcript, but this use of the transcript could not have affected
    the reliability of the verdict.  There is no suggestion that there were areas
    of inconsistency in the preliminary hearing transcript that trial counsel
    could have but failed to use to undermine the evidence of the Crown witnesses.  Further,
    trial counsel was able to make effective use of the divorce trial transcript,
    especially in cross-examination of the complainant’s father.</p>
  <p class=StyleHeading3Italic align=left style='text-align:left'>The Collateral
    Fact Rule</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[129]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that trial counsel did not understand the collateral fact
    rule and was therefore unable to make appropriate submissions when Crown
    counsel objected to the evidence of the appellant’s young cousin.  She would
    have testified to an incident when the complainant apparently swore at the
    appellant in her presence.  This evidence, if believed, would have contradicted
    the complainant on her assertion that she would never do any such thing for
    fear it would “trigger him off”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[130]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the appellant that admission of this evidence would not offend
    the collateral fact rule.  As this court explained in <i>R. v. P. (G.)</i> (1996),
    112 C.C.C. (3d) 263, at p. 275, subject to certain exceptions, the collateral
    fact rule prohibits a party from adducing extrinsic evidence to contradict
    a witness unless the extrinsic evidence is relevant to some issue in the
    case other than merely to contradict the witness.  In this case, the cousin’s
    evidence would not merely contradict the complainant’s assertion that she
    did not swear at the appellant on the occasion in question.  The evidence,
    if believed, could undermine the complainant’s assertion that the appellant,
    rather than she, was the verbally abusive party in the relationship.  It
    could also undermine her broad assertion that she would never swear at the
    appellant for fear that he would abuse her.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[131]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    in considering the impact on the reliability of the verdict, the issue is
    not simply whether more effective submissions could have been made; clearly
    they could have been.  The issue, it seems to me, is the impact on the reliability
    of the verdict because of the absence of this evidence, due to counsel’s
    failure to make appropriate submissions. I am not persuaded that the appellant
    has shown that the absence of the cousin’s evidence affected the reliability
    of the verdict.  The appellant has not produced on appeal any evidence from
    the cousin, and so the exact nature of her proposed testimony is unknown.  It
    is not possible to know whether the cousin’s testimony was credible nor how
    serious the alleged swearing incident was, and therefore the extent to which
    it would have undermined the complainant’s assertion.  It is theoretically
    possible that the appellant’s defence at trial would have been better had
    the cousin’s evidence been admitted, but that is not enough to show that
    the verdict is unreliable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[132]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    court dealt with a similar problem in <i>Davies</i>, where it was alleged
    that defence counsel was incompetent in his defence of the accused on charges
    of impaired driving causing death and criminal negligence causing death.  A
    particularly damaging piece of evidence was the results of a blood sample
    taken from the accused.  On appeal, it was argued that defence counsel was
    incompetent for failing to challenge the admissibility of this evidence.  This
    court held that the necessary prejudice was not made out solely on the basis
    of an assertion that the evidence should have been excluded.  As Moldaver
    J.A. said at para. 55:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Put differently,
    absent an evidentiary foundation, it is not enough for the appellant to claim
    that the blood sample evidence might theoretically have been excluded on
    the basis of some unidentified <i>Charter</i> breach; nor is it enough to
    speculate that the hospital staff may have taken the sample improperly or
    that it somehow became contaminated thereafter and that these hypothetical
    breaches would have been uncovered by more diligent counsel.</p>

    appellant submits that a miscarriage of justice was occasioned because counsel’s
    ineffective representation undermined the appearance of fairness of the trial.  This
    submission turns principally on trial counsel’s standing with the Law Society
    of Upper Canada.  Trial counsel acted for the appellant at his preliminary
    inquiry in February 2002, the divorce proceedings in May 2002, and the trial
    in January 2003.  At the time, counsel was not entitled to practice, having
    given an undertaking not to practice.  The undertaking was given in relation
    to his failure to maintain proper books and records. Trial counsel never
    disclosed to the appellant that he was not entitled to practice. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[135]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    July 2005, counsel was found guilty of professional misconduct for practicing
    in the period from June 2001 to December 2004 while not entitled to do so.  In
    the hearing in June, trial counsel told the discipline panel that he had
    only acted for two clients during this time and did not inform them that
    he had acted for the appellant.  The panel ordered that counsel be suspended
    for four months.  When he was cross-examined in relation to this appeal,
    trial counsel testified that for medical reasons he had not practised since
    his suspension.  Counsel on this appeal later learned that trial counsel
    had been practicing for about a month in the fall of 2006, again at a time
    when he was not entitled to practice.  Counsel was again disciplined in July
    2007 for practicing while under suspension.  </p>

line-height:normal'>[136]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the appearance of fairness was also affected by the
    trial counsel’s profoundly deficient knowledge of the law and obvious lack
    of credibility with the trial court.  The deficient knowledge of the law
    focuses on several areas:  the rules of evidence concerning recent fabrication,
    character evidence and collateral facts; the limited jurisdiction of the
    preliminary inquiry judge; the use of the deed to 55 Chapletown; and cross-examination
    on prior testimony.  Lack of credibility with the trial court relates to
    an admonition from the trial judge about cross-examination on the preliminary
    inquiry transcript, and the handing up of the character letters prior to
    sentencing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[137]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    am satisfied that trial counsel’s lack of legal knowledge did not affect
    the appearance of fairness.  I have already dealt with recent fabrication
    in the context of the reliability of the verdict.  Since any reasonable strategy
    would inevitably have required disclosure of the complainant’s statements
    to other persons, any deficiency in this respect could not have affected
    trial fairness.  Trial counsel’s mishandling of the deed issue similarly
    could not have affected trial fairness, since counsel was able to put the
    relevant evidence before the trial judge through cross-examination of the
    complainant’s father.  The admonitions from the trial judge about the use
    of the preliminary inquiry evidence and the character letters do not demonstrate
    such a fundamental breakdown in the trial judge’s trust of trial counsel
    as to render the trial unfair.  It is hardly unusual for trial judges to
    admonish counsel about the manner in which they are questioning witnesses.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[138]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    leaves counsel’s lack of familiarity with the collateral fact rule and his
    misunderstanding of the role of the preliminary inquiry judge.  The misunderstanding
    of the limited role of the preliminary inquiry judge could not affect the
    fairness of the trial.  His lack of knowledge of the collateral fact rule,
    which it would seem he shared with trial Crown counsel, does not demonstrate
    such a pervasive incapacity as to affect the fairness of the trial.  In my
    view, this allegation is more properly analyzed as a component of the allegation
    of ineffectiveness leading to an unreliable verdict, a matter I have already
    dealt with.</p>

line-height:normal'>[139]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    most troubling aspect of this submission concerns trial counsel’s lack of
    capacity to practice because of his suspension by the Law Society of Upper
    Canada.  This court has overturned verdicts where trial counsel was unable
    to provide effective representation due to intoxication and a disqualifying
    conflict of interest, irrespective of the impact on the reliability of the
    verdict.  An allegation of a miscarriage of justice based upon counsel’s
    status with the Law Society would appear to be a matter of first impression
    in this court.  In my view, however, the approach taken by this court where
    the related allegation of a disqualifying conflict of interest is first made
    on appeal is appropriate.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

      v. Widdifield</i> (1995), 25 O.R. (3d) 161 (C.A.), Doherty J.A. held that
      the appellant must demonstrate an actual conflict of interest between the
      respective interests represented by counsel, and some impairment of counsel’s
      ability to effectively represent the appellant’s interest as a result of
      the conflict.  If both criteria are established, “then the appellant has
      been denied the right to make full answer and defence and a miscarriage
      of justice has occurred.  The appellant need not demonstrate that, but
      for the ineffective representation of counsel, the verdict could have been
      different” (p. 173).  </p>

line-height:normal'>[141]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Adapting
    that approach to this case, the appellant must show that counsel was actually
    disqualified from practice and that his ability to effectively represent
    the appellant was impaired as a result of that disqualification.  The appellant
    has clearly made out the first criterion:  the appellant has shown that,
    unbeknownst to him, his lawyer was suspended from practice.  The appellant
    has not made out the second criterion.  Counsel’s suspension related to his
    failure to maintain records in accordance with Law Society regulations.  It
    is unnecessary to review counsel’s explanation for this failure since in
    general I find his testimony unconvincing.  But, this suspension did not
    relate to his competency and did not compromise his ability to provide competent
    representation.  Although he was suspended, trial counsel met with the appellant,
    his family and his witnesses on numerous occasions; he reviewed the disclosure
    including the complainant’s videotaped statement, which he watched several
    times; he obtained the transcript of the preliminary inquiry and the divorce
    trial; and he prepared the appellant and his witnesses to testify.</p>

    said that, it is a matter of serious concern that a lawyer who has been suspended
    from practice by the Law Society continued to represent an accused before
    the court. Had the trial judge been aware of the suspension, she would not
    have proceeded with the trial until the accused had the opportunity to retain
    and instruct other counsel. Clearly, judges or Crown counsel will act in
    cooperation with the Law Society to protect the public should they learn
    that a suspended or disbarred lawyer is representing an accused.</p>

    this evidence.  I am satisfied, however, that the error did not occasion
    any substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.  On this record, all that
    is known is that the cousin would have testified that on one occasion the
    complainant swore at the appellant in her presence.  When regard is had to
