style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants’ appeal against the judgment of Shaughnessy J. of the Superior
    Court of Justice dated June 7, 2007 whereby: (i) they were held jointly and
    severely liable to the respondent Luigi Pacitti in the aggregate sum of $49,424.58
    and to the respondent Domenic Pacitti in the aggregate sum of $34,119.37;
    and (ii) it was declared that they hold the sum of $46,447.97 in trust for
    the benefit of Luigi Pacitti.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>During
    oral argument, the appellants advanced three main grounds of appeal.  They
    argue that the trial judge: (i) erred in his calculation of the amounts owing
    to the respondents; (ii) erred by imposing personal liability on the individual
    appellant for the sums in issue; and (iii) erred by imposing a constructive
    trust in respect of part of the funds owed to Luigi Pacitti.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    reject the first two grounds of appeal.</p>
  <h2>(1)       Sums Owed to the Respondents</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although
    the appellants argue that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence concerning
    the debts in question and the sums allegedly owing to the appellants by the
    respondents, the trial judge’s findings are firmly grounded in the evidence
    of the respondents at trial.  The trial judge, as he was entitled to do,
    expressly rejected Robert Lutczyk’s evidence to the contrary.  He did so
    on two bases: (i) his adverse assessment of Mr. Lutczyk’s credibility; and
    (ii) his conclusion that the appellants’ claims of amounts allegedly owing
    to them and of the projected costs of completing the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Lake Simcoe project were inadequately supported on the evidence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    see no palpable and overriding error in the trial judge’s assessment of the
    amounts owing to the respondents, nor in his factual findings of the quantum
    of the debts in question.</p>
  <h2>(2)       Personal Liability of the Individual Appellant</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Nor
    do we accede to the appellants’ argument that the trial judge erred by imposing
    personal liability on Mr. Lutczyk for the amounts owed to the respondents.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge held that Mr. Lutczyk did not take reasonable steps to ensure
    that he was not holding himself out as an individual or as an agent of the
    corporate appellant or to make it known to the respondents that they were
    dealing with a numbered company.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Without
    accepting all of the trial judge’s reasoning on this issue, we agree with
    his observation that neither of the contracts in issue nor any other relevant
    business document mentioned the numbered company – the corporate appellant – although
    they did refer to Serenity Homes.  The respondents testified that they did
    not learn of the existence of the numbered company until after the appellants
    had unilaterally terminated both construction projects.  There was also evidence
    that the respondents had not heard of any company operating as “Serenity
    Homes”
    until after the termination of the contracts.  Further, it was Domenic Pacitti’s
    evidence that he believed that he was contracting directly with Mr. Lutczyk
    in respect of the construction of his cottage and, based on that business
    relationship, introduced Mr. Lutczyk to his son with respect to his son’s
    proposed plan to build a home.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    evidence, which was accepted by the trial judge, established that at no time
    during the currency of the contracts were the parties <i>ad idem</i> as to
    the involvement of a corporate contractor.</p>
  <h2>(3)       Imposition of a Constructive Trust</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    while we are sympathetic to the objective sought to be served by the trial
    judge in imposing a constructive trust on certain of the monies owed by the
    appellants to Luigi Pacitti, in the circumstances of this case we agree with
    the appellants that a constructive trust should not have been imposed.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    constructive trust remedy was sought by the respondents to protect against
    the possible bankruptcy of one or both of the appellants.  On the record
    before the trial judge, there was no evidence of a pending or even an intended
    bankruptcy of either appellant.  To the contrary, the prospect of a bankruptcy
    was entirely speculative.  Without deciding whether the fact of an impending
    bankruptcy would have justified the imposition of a construction trust, on
    this record it could not be said that the trial judge’s award of damages
    in favour of the respondents was an insufficient remedy for the appellants’ breach
    of contract.  Accordingly, the finding of the constructive trust cannot stand.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appeal is allowed in part by setting aside paragraph 3 of the trial judgment.  In
    all other respects, the appeal is dismissed and the trial judgment remains
    in full force and effect.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondents are entitled to their costs of the appeal, fixed in the amount
    of $6,000, inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>
