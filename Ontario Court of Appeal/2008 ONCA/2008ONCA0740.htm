    January 18, 2007, at approximately 10:45 p.m., D.S., L.T. and a group of
    their friends were in front of the City Centre on

    Elm Street in downtown
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Sudbury, waiting for a cab to take them to a party.  They had consumed alcohol
    and marijuana, and possibly some crack cocaine.  They were all intoxicated
    by alcohol and drugs. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>D.S.
    was aged 16 and L.T. was 15. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant, B.M., who was 18 years of age, was walking along
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Elm Street with his girlfriend.  B.M. was known to the group as a person
    who sold narcotics in that area of town.  B.M. and L.T. had had some type
    of dispute in the past and there were bad feelings between them.  The group
    chased B.M. on foot.  When they caught him, they pushed him to the ground.  One
    member of the group had a knife which he held to B.M.’s throat.  The group
    kicked and punched the complainant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    beating came to an end when a civilian walked out onto the street and observed
    the beating.  B.M. was unconscious and having seizures when police arrived
    on the scene.</p>

    sustained serious injuries to his facial area, including a broken nose, bruises,
    and a swollen lip.  He also sustained permanent brain injury.  He was in
    the hospital for 21 days following the assault and was still in the hospital
    at the time of sentencing.  Based on the Glasgow Coma Scale, the complainant
    came as close to dying from the assault as is possible without actually dying.</p>

    accused persons involved gave inculpatory statements to the police.  D.S.
    said that he was present during the assault but was not the main perpetrator.  He
    did not deliver any of the assaultive blows.  He saw the group running and
    followed suit.  He was not sure why he was running until he met up with the
    group where they had the complainant on the ground.  He said he wanted to
    kick B.M. in the head, and pushed others out of the way to do so, but B.M.
    was already unconscious.  A pair of boots worn by the appellant on the day
    of the incident was analysed.  Blood and hair were collected from the shoes;
    no forensic results were available at the time of sentencing.</p>

    a sentence that exceeded the maximum sentence permitted by the <i>YCJA</i>;</p>

    a sentence that was harsh, excessive and not fit, in all the circumstances.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown acknowledges that the first two errors were made.  However, counsel
    do not agree on how those errors should be remedied. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>IS THE SENTENCE ILLEGAL?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    42(15) of the <i>YCJA </i> reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(15) Subject to subsection (16), <b>if more than
      one youth sentence is imposed under this section in respect of a young
      person with respect to different offences, the continuous combined duration
      of those youth sentences shall not exceed</b> <b>three years</b>, except
      if one of the offences is first degree murder or second degree murder within
      the meaning of section 231 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, in which case the
      continuous combined duration of those youth sentences shall not exceed
      ten years in the case of first degree murder, or seven years in the case
      of second degree murder. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    a plain reading of s. 42(15) of the Act, subject to exceptions for murder,
    where more than one youth sentence is imposed in respect of different offences,
    the continuous combined duration of the sentences shall not exceed three
    years.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>D.S.
    was sentenced to a total of 42 months: 24 months’
    custody and supervision, and 18 months of probation.  More than one sentence
    was imposed under s. 42 in respect of different offences, therefore the three-year
    maximum duration of the sentences imposed by s. 42(15) applies.  As 42 months
    is greater than three years, the sentence that was imposed is illegal.  It
    must be reduced so that the maximum sentence imposed is no greater than 36
    months.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    appears that the sentencing judge considered whether the sentence exceeded
    the three-year maximum permissible under s. 42(15) without taking into account
    the credit that he intended to give the appellant for his pre-sentence custody.  In <i>R.
    v. B.(T.)</i> (2006), 78 O.R. (3d) 721, this court established that to do
    so is an error.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    paras. 28 through 32 of <i>B.(T.)</i>, Lang J.A., writing for the court,
    explained that the credit to be given a young person for his or her pre-sentence
    custody must be deducted from the maximum sentence imposed under s. 42(15):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[28]<span
style='font-size:7.0pt;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown argues, however, that the sentence “imposed” on the appellant was only
    33 months and that pre-sentence custody cannot be included as part of the
    sentence “imposed”. I do not agree. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[29]<span
style='font-size:7.0pt;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since
    a sentence includes the punishment served both before and after sentencing,
    time served is a component of the offender’s overall custodial sentence.
    This is consistent with <i>Fice</i>, <i>supra</i>, which said<i> </i>at para.
    21: </p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>Treating pre-sentence custody as part of the
    total punishment imposed also accords with the fact that, for purposes of
    precedent, the respondent’s “sentence” for the offence she committed will
    generally be understood to be the global sum of 50 months, rather than the
    14 months actually imposed by the trial judge.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[30]<span
style='font-size:7.0pt;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly,
    in considering young offender sentences, the Manitoba Court of Appeal looked
    at sentences for adult offenders, noting “an adult will not, barring unusual
    circumstances, receive the maximum penalty set out in the <i>Criminal Code</i> if
    he or she has spent a substantial time in pretrial custody”: <i>R. v. K.(C.J.)</i>,

style='font-size:7.0pt;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I cannot accept the argument that time served must be taken into account
    in determining an appropriate sentence, but must not be taken into account
    in determining a maximum sentence. To hold otherwise would create an illogical
    anomaly in the interpretation of the two provisions. Any ambiguity in the
    meaning of s. 42(15) is resolved by considering it in the context of s. 38(3)(<i>d</i>).
    This section clearly requires that pre-sentence custody be taken into account. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[32]<span
style='font-size:7.0pt;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pre-sentence
    custody must be deducted from a maximum sentence under s. 42(15).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I explain below, apart from the two errors that the Crown concedes the sentencing
    judge made, the sentence was otherwise fit.  The sentencing judge intended
    to impose the maximum two-year custody and supervision order.  To give effect
    to that intention, I would remedy the first error by reducing the 18-month
    period of probation to 12 months.</p>

    appellant spent seven months and one week in pre-sentence custody for which

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    38(3)(d) of the <i>YCJA</i> requires the youth justice court to take into
    account “the time spent in detention by the young person as a result of the
    offence”.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[3]</span></span></span></a>  The question of how pre-sentence custody should
    be credited, pursuant to s. 38(3)(d), was considered in <i>B.(T.)</i>.  Justice
    Lang, on behalf of this court, answered that question by considering first
    the two reasons why adult offenders are often credited with more than one
    day for each day of pre-sentence custody.  First, adult detention centres
    lack the resources of correctional facilities and their conditions are generally
    more onerous than those in correctional facilities.  Second, adult offenders
    are eligible for statutory release and parole but, in determining eligibility,
    pre-sentence custody is not taken into account.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She
    went on to note that young offenders have historically been given credit
    only for time served in pre-sentence custody (i.e. a one-for-one basis) because
    they were not entitled to statutory remission and because they did not experience
    the harsh conditions suffered by adults in detention centres.  At para. 40
    of <i>B.(T.)</i>, Lang J.A. explains that the situation of young offenders
    has been changed by the <i>YCJA</i>:    <i> </i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>However, under the <i>YCJA</i>, youth sentences
    are now comprised of two-thirds custody and one-third community supervision.  Thus,
    young persons are now in a similar position to adult offenders in that time
    in pre-sentence custody delays their eligibility for community supervision.  For
    example, a youth sentenced to nine months would serve six of those months
    in [secure] custody, the same amount of time served by T.B. in this case.  It
    is for this reason that, under the <i>YCJA</i>, trial judges have credited
    a youth with 1.5 days for every day spent in pre-sentence custody.  On a
    1.5-for-one basis, the appellant would receive credit for nine months of
    pre-sentence custody.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the credit to be given for pre-sentence custody is a discretionary matter;
    it is not a mechanical calculation.  There are a number of ways in which
    pre-sentence detention can be “taken into account”, including in the decision
    to reduce the type or severity of the sentence.  As Lang J.A. explains in
    paras. 41 to 42 of <i>B.(T.)</i>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Whether such a credit will be given in a particular
    case will depend on more than the application of an arithmetical formula.  Section
    38(3) lists a number of factors to be taken into account in determining the
    appropriate sentence, only one of which is pre-sentence custody.  The s.
    38(3) factors do not attract a determination on a formulaic basis.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Thus, while a 1.5 credit may be the starting point
    for crediting pre-sentence custody, other considerations may affect the appropriate
    credit.  Such factors may include the conditions of the youth’s pre-sentence
    custody, the reasons for that detention, the length of the detention, the
    reasons for any delay in reaching trial or sentencing, and the youth’s need
    for further custody or community service to meet the purposes of the <i>YCJA.  </i>[Footnotes
    omitted.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So,
    for example, in <i>R. v. E.L. </i>(2006), 210 O.A.C. 124, this court confirmed
    a youth sentence in which significantly less than one-for-one credit was
    given for pre-sentence custody.  However, the court affirmed the reasoning
    in <i>B.(T.)</i>, noting that only in exceptional cases should the youth
    justice court exercise its discretion to reduce the credit given below one-for-one. <i> </i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the present case, the sentencing judge appears to have approached the matter
    on the basis that credit would be given on a one-for-one basis.  At the same
    time, his intention was to impose the same sentence on the appellant and
    his co-accused, L.T.  Rather than ensuring parity, however, by failing to
    give the appellant one-for-one credit for his pre-sentence custody, the appellant
    ended up serving a longer effective sentence than his co-accused.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown concedes that there were no exceptional circumstances that warranted
    a departure from crediting the appellant on a one-for-one basis.  Indeed,
    the Crown at the sentencing hearing had indicated that while it sought the
    same sentence for both accused, the appellant had a further one month of
    pre-sentence custody for which he should be credited.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    us, the Crown argues that the sentencing judge was justified in refusing
    to give enhanced credit, however.  I agree.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    primary argument advanced below for giving enhanced credit was the premise
    that the appellant had used his time in pre-sentence custody to rehabilitate
    while his co-accused had not.  The appellant did make progress while in custody,
    as the sentencing judge recognized.  However, that progress appears to have
    come only in the final month of pre-sentence custody, following his plea
    of guilt.  In declining to give enhanced credit, the sentencing judge took
    into account evidence of the appellant’s long history of disciplinary problems
    during detention.  He also observed that the detention facility was similar
    to the facility in which the appellant would serve the secure custody part
    of his sentence.  The sentencing judge properly considered whether to give
    the appellant enhanced credit and he gave reasons for the exercise of discretion
    in refusing to give such credit.  The exercise of discretion is entitled
    to deference and I would not interfere with it.       </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I would vary the 24-month custody and supervision order by giving credit
    for seven months and one week, rather than for six months.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>IS THE SENTENCE OTHERWISE FIT?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the sentencing judge failed to give adequate consideration
    to youth sentencing principles and the particular circumstance of the appellant’s
    involvement in the offence.  He emphasizes that the appellant’s role was
    “markedly different” from that of the co-accused in that he did not deliver
    any of the blows to the complainant and was not a principal actor.  He points
    to s. 38(3)(a) of the <i>YCJA </i>which requires the youth justice court
    to take into account the “degree of participation by the young person in
    the commission of the offence”.  He contends that the sentencing judge erred
    in failing to properly take into account the nature and degree of the appellant’s
    participation and in failing to draw a distinction between the appellant’s
    participation and that of his co-accused, L.T.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, the appellant submits that the sentencing judge failed to fully
    consider the appellant’s personal circumstances.  The appellant was an Aboriginal
    person who came from a very dysfunctional family.  He had been made a Crown
    ward at the age of seven as his parents were both crack cocaine addicts who
    spent most of their lives in and out of jails.  However, the appellant was
    not without prospects for rehabilitation.  Unlike his co-accused, as has
    already been noted, the appellant used at least some of his time in pre-sentence
    custody to work towards rehabilitation.  In the later part of that detention,
    he actively and genuinely participated in programs that were available to
    him and also came under the care of a psychiatrist who had prescribed medication
    to him to assist him with his personal issues.  <u></u></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sentencing judge was fully alive to both of these considerations.  In respect
    of the appellant’s involvement, while he acknowledged that the appellant
    did not deliver any blows to the complainant, he found that the appellant’s
    participation was an integral part of the vicious, unprovoked attack on the
    complainant.  He described the appellant’s conduct as “closely intertwined” with
    what happened to the victim.  He noted that the appellant wanted to kick
    the complainant and took steps to do so, however, he “didn’t or couldn’t”.  He
    noted also the evidence, including the blood on the appellant’s boot, which
    showed that he was in close physical proximity to the victim.  He found that
    the appellant’s “presence and his determination to get at the victim fuelled
    the other offenders.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sentencing judge considered the two accused as morally equal participants
    such that no distinction should be drawn based on their degree of participation
    in the assault.  On the record, he was justified in reaching this conclusion.  The
    appellant intended to kick the victim in the head and attempted to participate
    in the assault as a principal actor.  His presence fuelled the assaultive
    parties.  He acted in concert with the group to violently assault a single
    person.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sentencing judge gave full consideration to the appellant’s Aboriginal status
    and tragic upbringing.  I see nothing in the argument that he failed to consider
    the appellant’s personal circumstances.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>DISPOSITION<u></u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I would allow the appeal and vary the sentence as follows:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>1.         24 months for
    the aggravated assault, less credit of seven months and one week of pre-sentence
    custody, which leaves a sentence of 16 months and three weeks (67 weeks).  The
    67-week period is to be comprised of 45 weeks of closed custody followed
    by 22 weeks of community supervision; and</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>2.         12
    months’ probation for the breach of probation. <u></u></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant has served seven additional weeks of custody.  That time is to
    be credited against the 22 weeks of community supervision, leaving 15 weeks
    of community supervision to be followed by 12 months of probation.  </p>
