    two appeals deal with parking covenants contained in two leases entered into
    by the landlord, Hazeldean Properties Inc. (Hazeldean).  The first lease,
    with Royal LePage Team Realty Ltd. (Royal LePage), guarantees that at least
    30 parking spaces will be available to Royal LePage’s clients and staff,
    of which six spaces are to be marked as reserved exclusively for Royal LePage.  The
    second lease, with Good Life Corporation (Good Life), provides for unlimited
    access to parking for Good Life clients and staff, and imposes constraints
    on Hazeldean’s ability to “reduce the available spaces for Tenant parking
    available at the commencement of the Lease”. </p>

    Life appeals from the dismissal of its application for an injunction restraining
    Hazeldean from permitting the reservation of parking spaces for the exclusive
    use of other tenants and for a declaration that Hazeldean is currently in
    violation of the parking covenant contained in the Good Life lease because
    it has given exclusive parking spaces to two tenants, Royal LePage and the
    Bank of Nova Scotia.  Royal LePage appeals from the dismissal of its application
    for a declaration that it is entitled to 30 spaces reserved exclusively for
    its clients and staff or, in the alternative, for a declaration that it is
    entitled to 6 reserved spaces. </p>

    it provides that Good Life will have unlimited access to parking at the property,
    and restricts Hazeldean’s ability to reduce the number of parking spaces
    from the number that was available to Good Life at the commencement of the
    lease.  The parking provision in the Good Life lease reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Tenant shall have unlimited access to parking
    at the property for its members and staff at no cost.  The Landlord shall
    not reduce the available spaces for Tenant parking available at the commencement

    requirements by municipal authorities or governmental authorities respecting
    expropriation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    parking in the plaza generally complies with the Municipality’s By-Laws,
    several tenants have received complaints from both clients and staff regarding
    the inadequacy of the parking arrangements.  These complaints, and the resulting
    tension, were the impetus for the applications brought by both Good Life
    and Royal LePage.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the proceedings before the application judge, Good Life took the position
    that it was entitled to non-exclusive parking rights for the entire parking
    lot and that by granting Royal LePage and the Bank of Nova Scotia reserved
    spaces, Hazeldean breached the parking covenant in the Good Life lease.  Royal
    LePage argued that it was entitled to 30 exclusive parking spaces and to
    the extent that these spaces were not available to Royal LePage at all times,
    Hazeldean was in breach of the parking covenant in the Royal LePage lease.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge dismissed Good Life’s application.  He found that the term
    “access” in the Good Life lease was ambiguous, and interpreted it to mean
    access to the parking lot generally, as opposed to access specifically to
    individual parking spaces.  The application judge further found that the
    words “commencement of the lease” referred to in the parking covenant had
    the same meaning as the expression “Commencement Date”, which is a defined
    term in the Good Life lease and, on the facts, works out to be November 14,
    2004.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From
    November 14, 2004, to the date of the application, the number of parking
    spaces at the shopping plaza remained constant at 275, the number provided
    for in the final site plan approved by the Municipality in October 2003.  In
    the application judge’s view, the fact that Hazeldean may choose to grant
    to some of the tenants the exclusive right to use a specific number of these
    spaces does not “reduce the available spaces for [Good Life] parking” contrary
    to the parking covenant in the Good Life lease.  There was, therefore, no
    basis for finding that Hazeldean breached the parking covenant in the Good
    Life lease, nor was there a basis for enjoining Hazeldean from later granting
    to a tenant the exclusive use of any or all of the parking spaces.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge also dismissed Royal LePage’s application.  The reasons
    do not expressly address the basis for this dismissal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h3><u><span lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>Good Life’s Parking Covenant</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    appeal, Good Life argues that the application judge erred in his interpretation
    of the parking covenant.  Good Life submits that, properly interpreted, and
    viewed in the context of the entire lease, the first sentence of that covenant, “[t]he
    Tenant shall have unlimited access to parking at the property for its members
    and staff at no cost”, makes it clear that Good Life has unlimited access
    to the all of the parking spaces at the shopping plaza.  Restricting Good
    Life’s access to some spaces by granting other tenants the exclusive use
    of a certain number of parking spaces therefore contravenes the terms of
    the Good Life lease.  Good Life further submits that the second sentence, “[t]he
    Landlord shall not reduce the available spaces for Tenant parking available
    at the commencement of the Lease, during the Term of the Lease or any extension
    thereof”, restricts Hazeldean’s ability to reduce the number of spaces in
    the parking area from the 275 spaces that were originally constructed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not agree with Good Life’s interpretation of the parking covenant.  In
    my view, the meaning of the term “access” in the first sentence of the parking
    covenant is clear and unambiguous, and I agree with the application judge’s
    interpretation of the term, namely, that it refers to access generally to “parking”.  The
    second sentence, however, refers specifically to the availability of “spaces” for
    parking.  Read in context, therefore, the first sentence addresses the issue
    of access to the parking area generally, and makes it clear that Hazeldean
    cannot impose restrictions on Good Life’s access to the parking area, for
    example, by setting limited hours of operation or charging a fee for parking.  The
    second sentence, on the other hand, deals specifically with the availability
    of parking spaces and makes it clear that Hazeldean cannot reduce the number
    of spaces that were available for Good Life’s use at the “commencement of
    the Lease”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    Good Life wanted to ensure access, specifically, to all of the individual
    parking spaces in the parking area, as opposed to the parking lot generally,
    it was incumbent on Good Life to specify accordingly in the lease.  Similarly,
    if Good Life wished to prevent the landlord from granting reserved spaces
    anywhere in the parking lot to other tenants, it should have negotiated for
    the inclusion of such a clause in the lease.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Good
    Life also argues that if the first sentence of the parking covenant simply
    ensures access to the parking lot generally, this sentence becomes redundant
    and effectively useless.  Good Life maintains that access to the parking
    area is guaranteed by virtue of other provisions in the lease regarding the
    common elements of the shopping plaza.  Accordingly, Good Life submits that
    since these provisions ensure access to the common elements, and the parking
    area is a common element, the application judge’s interpretation of the first
    sentence of the parking covenant cannot be correct.  I would not give effect
    to this submission.  The clauses dealing with the common elements do not
    provide for unlimited access to all of the common elements.  Absent the first
    sentence in the parking covenant, the landlord would not be precluded by
    the common element provisions in the lease from placing limits on access
    to the parking area.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Good
    Life submits in the alternative that the application judge erred in his interpretation
    of the phrase “commencement of the Lease” in the second sentence of the parking
    covenant.  Specifically, the application judge erred in concluding that the
    date of “commencement of the Lease” in the parking covenant is the same as
    the “Commencement Date”, as defined in the lease.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second sentence of the parking covenant provides that the landlord “shall
    not reduce the available spaces for Tenant parking available at the commencement
    of the Lease, during the Term of the lease or any extension thereof.”  Rather
    than prohibiting absolutely the reduction of available spaces, this sentence
    operates to prohibit the reduction of available spaces after a certain date,
    namely, the date of “commencement of the Lease”.  The issue, therefore, is
    the determination of that date.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Good
    Life submits that the date of “commencement of the Lease” should be interpreted
    as December 24, 2002, the date the conditional offer to lease was accepted
    and thereby became binding, and not the much later “Commencement Date”.  The
    Good Life lease defines
    “Commencement Date” as being 90 days after the possession date, which, pursuant
    to the amendments to the lease, is August 23, 2004, or the date Good Life
    opens for business, if that date is earlier.  Since Good Life only opened
    for business on January 2, 2005, the
    “Commencement Date” for the space Good Life was to occupy in the plaza therefore
    works out to be November 14, 2004, 90 days after the possession date.
      Good Life argues that because the leases with Royal LePage and the Bank
    of Nova Scotia were entered into after December 24, 2002, and because these
    leases granted Royal LePage and the Bank of Nova Scotia the exclusive use
    of a certain number of parking spaces, Hazeldean contravened the parking
    covenant “not to reduce the available spaces”
    for Good Life parking “available at the commencement of the Lease”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the application judge was correct.  It would make little sense for
    the commencement of the lease for parking purposes to be a date almost two
    years before the commencement of the lease for purposes other than parking.  Further,
    on December 24, 2002, the date the offer to lease became binding, Hazeldean
    was still negotiating with the Municipality regarding the total number of
    parking spaces required for the entire project.  As noted earlier, the number
    of spaces was ultimately reduced in the course of these negotiations from
    292 to 275.  It therefore could not have been the intention of the parties
    that the “available spaces for Tenant parking at the commencement of the
    Lease” would be determined as of the date that the offer to lease became
    binding, since at that date, the number of parking spaces that would ultimately
    be constructed was still inconclusive.  </p>

    disagree, however, with the application judge’s conclusion that Hazeldean
    is at liberty to grant exclusive parking spaces to other tenants in addition
    to those already granted to the Bank of Nova Scotia and Royal LePage.  In
    my view, when spaces are reserved for other tenants, these parking spaces
    are no longer
    “available spaces” for Good Life.  The application judge’s interpretation
    that the reserved spaces are available simply because Good Life clients and
    staff can access the parking area generally renders the second sentence of
    the parking covenant meaningless and, in effect, wrongly equates the phrase “access
    to parking at the property” with the phrase
    “available spaces for tenant”.  Taken to the extreme, this interpretation
    would mean that Hazeldean could allow other tenants to reserve all of the
    parking spaces in the shopping plaza.  Good Life customers would have access
    to the parking area, but would have no spaces in which to park.  This defeats
    the clear intent and stated purpose of the clause, which is not only to ensure
    that “spaces” are available to Good Life clients and staff, but also that
    the spaces that were “available”
    to Good Life at the commencement of the lease remain available during the
    term of the lease and any extension thereof.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
    on the foregoing discussion, I would allow the appeal in part, and declare
    that the parking covenant in the Good Life lease restricts Hazeldean’s ability
    to grant reserved parking spaces to tenants of the plaza beyond those already
    granted on November 14, 2004, the date of commencement of the lease.  I would
    not, however, issue an injunction to the same effect.  Hazeldean has indicated
    before us that it does not intend to grant any additional reserved parking
    spaces beyond those already in place.  I therefore do not consider an injunction
    to be an appropriate remedy.  I would simply issue a declaration.</p>

      LePage claims that it is entitled to 30 reserved parking spaces.  Although
      the application judge dismissed Royal LePage’s application, his reasons
      do not specifically address the basis for his rejection of Royal LePage’s
      claim.  Royal LePage submits that the trial judge erred in this regard
      and, at a minimum, the application judge ought to have granted partial
      relief by declaring that 6 of the 30 spaces could be reserved exclusively
      for Royal LePage staff and clients.</span></p>

      the application judge ought to have given reasons for rejecting Royal LePage’s
      request for the declaration in respect of the 30 parking spaces, he was,
      in my opinion, correct in dismissing this portion of Royal LePage’s application.  Correctly
      interpreted, the parking covenant does not grant Royal LePage 30 reserved
      spaces.  The relevant sentence of the parking covenant reads as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Said spaces shall be located on
      the upper level of the Lands and side of the Lands and 6 of the guaranteed
      30 spaces shall be located as indicated in the Schedule 1 and marked reserved
      for Royal LePage customers or staff.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A
      clear distinction is made between the 6 spaces that are to be “marked reserved”,
      and the remaining 24 spaces.  Whatever was intended by referring to the
      30 spaces as “guaranteed”, it is clear that this reference could not mean
      that the spaces are reserved exclusively for Royal LePage.  Absent marking
      the remaining 24 spaces as reserved, the spaces can invariably be used
      by all of the plaza’s tenants. </span></p>

      these 30 spaces are to be located on the property of the plaza. </span></p>

      Royal LePage’s application for a declaration that it was entitled to 30
      reserved parking spaces was dismissed, it is apparent from his reasons
      that the application judge recognized that Royal LePage did have the right
      to 6 reserved parking spaces.  On appeal, Hazeldean has all but conceded
      that a declaration to that effect could be issued and, in my view, the
      parking covenant clearly provides for this right. </span></p>

      that Royal LePage is entitled to 6 parking spaces, located as set out in
      the parking covenant, and that these spaces may be marked as reserved for
      Royal LePage clients or staff.  In light of my disposition of the Good
      Life appeal, it is clear that the granting of this declaration in the Royal
      LePage appeal does not affect Good Life’s parking rights.</span></p>

      would allow both the Royal LePage and Good Life appeals in part, and I
      would issue declarations as follows:</span></p>
  <p><span

      may not grant reserved parking spaces on the subject property over and

  <p><span

      the circumstances, I would not award costs for or against Royal LePage.  Royal
      LePage was justified in bringing and had partial success on this appeal
      and, although Hazeldean did not strenuously oppose the granting of a declaration
      as to the 6 parking spaces in its submissions, there was no clear concession
      to that effect in its materials.  I would therefore make no award of costs
      as between Royal LePage and Hazeldean.</span></p>

      in breach of the parking covenant, and requesting a permanent injunction.  Therefore,
      in the circumstances, I would award Hazeldean costs against Good Life in
      the reduced amount of $5,000, inclusive of GST and disbursements.</span></p>
