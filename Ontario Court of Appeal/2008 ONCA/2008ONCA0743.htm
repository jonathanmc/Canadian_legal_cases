    this appeal, the appellant father seeks to set aside the trial judgment,
    which awarded, among other relief, sole custody of the children to the respondent
    mother, and further awarded the respondent mother child support in the amount
    of $300 per month, based on an imputed annual income to the appellant of
    $20,000.  The appellant also seeks various additional relief, which includes
    costs and an order for a new trial.</p>

  <p>1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    fairness of the trial was undermined by procedural defects both before and
    during the trial; and </p>
  <p>2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    trial judge had a conflict of interest and was biased against the appellant.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><u><span lang=EN-US>Fairness</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that he could not receive a fair trial in Sudbury, for the
    following reasons: he had been before the court roughly 40 times on this
    matter before commencing the trial; he had reported three Sudbury lawyers
    to the Law Society; no lawyer in Sudbury was willing to represent him; and,
    he had only recently been approved for legal aid and had not yet had the
    opportunity to retain a lawyer.  The appellant further argues that he was
    rushed to trial despite being overwhelmed by stress, having received the
    trial record only 15 minutes before trial, and not having been provided with
    either a witness list or an opportunity to discover the named witnesses prior
    to trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    would not give effect to this ground of appeal.  This proceeding was commenced
    in 2002 and, as reflected by the great many court appearances, was quite
    difficult.  The appellant had ample opportunity to retain a lawyer, and nothing
    in the record suggests that the court in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Sudbury would not give the appellant a fair hearing.  Further, it is apparent
    that, at the outset of trial, the appellant was well aware of the case he
    had to meet, albeit without representation by a lawyer.  The trial record,
    although only served the day before trial, contained only documents that
    were already in the appellant’s possession.  In any event, while the trial
    commenced on October 17, 2005, it was adjourned on several occasions due
    to the appellant’s unavailability or illness, and to allow for settlement
    discussions.  As a result, the trial was not completed before March 7, 2006.  Over
    those 4½ months, the appellant had sufficient time to retain a lawyer and
    to respond to the documents and information that he alleged were only disclosed
    to him on the eve of trial.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><u><span lang=EN-US>Allegation of bias</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that the trial judge had a conflict of interest and was
    biased against the appellant, which undermined the fairness of the trial
    or, at the very least, the appearance thereof.  We do not agree.  From our
    review of the record, there was no conflict of interest, nor was there an
    appearance of unfairness or partiality on the part of the trial judge, let
    alone a bias, against the appellant.  The trial judge’s interventions and
    overall management of the trial demonstrated patience throughout and a genuine
    concern to reach the correct result for the parties, as well as for their
    children, and did not constitute misconduct nor disclose any bias or partiality.  The
    defendant was in no way deprived of a fair hearing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, the appeal is dismissed with costs to the respondent Shauna
    Harris/Lehto in the amount of $4,000, inclusive of GST and disbursements.</p>
