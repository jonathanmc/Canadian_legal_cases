  <h4><span lang=EN-US>OVERVIEW</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The
      central issue on this appeal is whether a class proceeding involving thousands
      of small claims by “payday” loan borrowers for allegedly illegal interest
      should be stayed on the ground that the loan agreements contain arbitration
      clauses.  The appellants, the lenders, have already unsuccessfully litigated
      that issue all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The
      appellants nonetheless renewed their request for a stay in the court below
      and asked that the class proceeding be decertified.  They argued that two
      subsequent decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada in cases from Quebec,  </span><i>Dell
      Computer Corp. v. Union des consommateurs</i>, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 801, and <i>Rogers
      Wireless Inc. v. Muroff</i>, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 921, <span lang=EN-GB>changed
      the law in Ontario and that they were entitled to the benefit of that change.  The
      respondents, the borrower class, countered with a motion for summary judgment.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The
      motion judge dismissed both motions.  He held that <i>Dell </i>and <i>Rogers </i>were
      distinguishable and inapplicable in Ontario; provisions of the <i>Consumer
      Protection Act</i>, <i>2002,</i> S.O. 2002, c. 30, Sch. A. allowing the
      respondents to pursue their claim in court despite the arbitration clauses
      applied retroactively; and the stay should be refused pursuant to s. 7(2)5
      of the </span><i>Arbitration Act, 1991</i>, S.O. 1991, c. 17<span lang=EN-GB>.  In
      the alternative, he held that the appellants were estopped from renewing
      their stay motion under the doctrine of issue estoppel.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The
      appellants come to this court asking that the motion judge’s decision be
      set aside and that the class proceeding be stayed and decertified.  For
      the reasons that follow, I conclude that even if <i>Dell </i>and <i>Rogers</i> have
      changed the law of Ontario, and even if the <i>Consumer Protection</i> <i>Act,
      2002 </i>provisions do not have retroactive effect, the motion judge properly
      exercised his discretion to apply the doctrine of issue estoppel and deny
      the appellants’ motion to stay and decertify the class proceeding.</span></p>

      appellants, National Money Mart and its American parent Dollar Financial
      Group, are in the business of providing “payday” loans.  These are small,
      short-term loans with due dates connected to the borrower’s payday.  The
      rate of interest is specified at 59% and there are other fees payable by
      the borrower at the time of repayment.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-GB>The
      plaintiff class, estimated to include 210,000 members and to involve over
      four million transactions, seeks damages estimated at more that $300 million,
      alleging that the rate of interest and fees charged by the appellants for
      these loans exceed the rate of interest prescribed by s. 347 of the <i>Criminal
      Code</i>. </span></p>
  <h3><i><span lang=EN-GB style='font-weight:normal'>(ii)  The arbitration clauses</span></i></h3>

      2001, the appellants began inserting a class action waiver clause into
      their payday loan agreements whereby the borrower purportedly waives the
      right to bring a court action with respect to the loan and is required
      to submit any dispute for resolution to binding arbitration.  Margaret
      Smith, who has since died, was formerly one of the representative plaintiffs.  She
      entered into various loan agreements containing arbitration clauses.  The
      first agreement, dated February 13, 2003, contained the following clause:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-GB>Any claim, dispute or issue whether
      in contract, tort or otherwise, arising out of or in connection with the
      Loan or this Loan Agreement or any prior or future loan agreement between
      the parties, including any issue regarding related fees, advertising, promotion
      or any oral or written statement or the absence thereof, default of payment,
      and/or the relationship between the parties shall, upon election by either
      party be resolved by binding arbitration in accordance with The Arbitration
      Act of Ontario<i> </i>as amended (“the Act”).  No joinder or consolidation
      of claims with other persons are permitted without the consent of the parties
      hereto.  In the event of a conflict between this arbitration provision
      and the Act, the terms of this arbitration provision shall govern.</span></p>

      agreements contained differently worded clauses providing for mediation
      and arbitration of disputes, as well as the following class action waiver: </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-GB>Each party also agrees not to
      commence or participate in any class action either as a representative
      plaintiff or as a member of a plaintiff class, and to opt out of any class

      out of the Loan Agreement].</span></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-GB>In
      2005, the appellants moved to stay the representative plaintiff’s claim
      pursuant to s.&nbsp;7(1) of the </span><i>Arbitration Act</i>.  That section
      provides: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>7. (1)  If a party to an arbitration agreement
    commences a proceeding in respect of a matter to be submitted to arbitration
    under the agreement, the court in which the proceeding is commenced shall,
    on the motion of another party to the arbitration agreement, stay the proceeding.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    motion, and a motion to stay the action against Dollar Financial Group for
    want of jurisdiction, was dismissed by E.M. Macdonald J.: (2005), 18 C.P.C.
    (6th) 1 (S.C.).  She held that the Ontario courts did have jurisdiction to
    entertain the claim against Dollar Financial Group and that the request for
    a stay should be determined by the judge hearing the certification motion
    when deciding whether a class proceeding was the “preferable procedure” under
    s. 5(1)(d) of the <i>Class Proceedings Act, 1992</i>, S.O. 1992, c. 6. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

    October 7, 2005, this court quashed an appeal from that decision: (2005),
    258 D.L.R. (4th) 453.  Writing for the court, Weiler J.A. held<span
lang=EN-GB> that the motion judge had correctly held that the issue of whether
    to stay the action on account of the arbitration clause should be dealt with
    at the certification hearing.  As the stay issue had been deferred to the
    certification judge, the order denying the stay was interlocutory in nature
    and this court had no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal.  The Supreme
    Court of Canada refused the appellants’ request for leave to appeal: (2006),
    223 O.A.C. 394n.</span></p>

    Ontario had jurisdiction to entertain the action against Dollar Financial

      case then proceeded to a certification hearing.</span><span lang=EN-GB>  </span>On
      January 5, 2007, Hoy J. certified the action as a class proceeding: (2007), <span class=documentbody>37
      C.P.C. (6th) 171</span> (S.C.).  With respect to the arbitration clause
      and the appellants’ submission that the respondents were obliged to arbitrate
      and were precluded from litigating, Hoy J. held, at para. 132:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I am satisfied that a class proceeding is preferable
    to arbitration or mediation.  Money Mart itself says that the cost of proving
    individual claims would exceed any possible recovery by class members.  Money
    Mart does not concede that it has breached section 347 of the <span
class=italic1><span style='color:black'>Criminal Code</span></span> or offer
    to fund counsel for borrowers who elect to mediate or arbitrate.  The uncontradicted
    evidence of plaintiffs’
    counsel is that, if retained, the cost to prepare for and attend an individual
    mediation or arbitration would exceed $15,000 and $20,000, respectively.  The
    plaintiffs cannot afford such legal fees.  The legal fees would be disproportionate
    to the amount [in] issue in an individual mediation or arbitration.  Ms.
    Smith’s claim, by way of example, involves only about $83.  Plaintiffs’ counsel
    is acting on a contingency basis in this action, and the plaintiffs have
    obtained funding from the Class Proceedings Fund.  Money Mart has never elected
    to arbitrate any dispute with any of its customers at any time; it has instead
    chosen to resort to the courts, instituting over 137,000 [sic] actions during
    the class period against customers who did not repay their loans.  Nor has
    a customer ever asked for arbitration or mediation.  I do not believe that
    any class member would spend the time, or expend the effort, necessary to
    mediate or arbitrate.</p>

      class action rights are mere procedural rights that can be waived under

    address the jurisdictional issues.</span></p>
  <h3><i><span style='font-weight:normal'>1.  Jurisdiction to entertain the appeal
        from the refusal to grant a stay</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents rely on s. 7(6) of the <i>Arbitration Act</i> which provides
    that “[t]here is no appeal from the court’s decision” from an order made
    on an application for a stay under s. 7.  In <i>Huras v. Primerica Financial
    Services Ltd</i>. (2000), 137 O.A.C. 79, at para. 10, this court affirmed
    a line of authority to the effect that where a stay is refused on the ground
    that the dispute lies beyond the reach of s. 7 and the <i>Arbitration Act</i> is
    not applicable, the prohibition in s. 7(6) against an appeal is equally not
    applicable.  Here, the motion judge ruled that the <i>Arbitration Act</i> was
    not applicable in the face of the <i>Consumer Protection Act, 2002</i> provisions
    that rendered the waiver of the right to bring an action invalid.  It follows,
    in my view, that s. 7(6) does not apply to deny the appellants a right of
    appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    oral argument, the panel raised the question of whether the order denying
    a stay was an interlocutory order.  That proposition was also rejected at
    para. 12 in <i>Huras</i> on the ground that an order denying a s. 7 stay “finally
    determines the forum in which the dispute between the parties is to be resolved” and
    deprives the party seeking the stay of the substantive contractual right
    to arbitration.  Similarly, orders denying a stay for want of jurisdiction
    or on the ground of <i>forum non conveniens</i> have been held to be final
    for the purposes of appeal: see e.g.<i> M.J. Jones Inc. v. Kingsway General
    Insurance Co.</i> (2003), 68 O.R. (3d) 131 (C.A.).  By denying the appellants’ request
    to “go back to square one” on the stay issue and by refusing the stay, the
    motion judge finally disposed of the appellants’ claim for a stay and finally
    determined the forum in which the dispute will be resolved.  It follows that
    the order was final in nature for the purposes of this appeal. </p>
  <h3><i><span style='font-weight:normal'>2. The summary judgment appeal</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the conclusion of oral argument on the summary judgment issue, we indicated
    that that appeal from the motion judge’s comments regarding the defences
    would be dismissed for want of jurisdiction.  The motion judge’s order dismissing
    the respondents’ motion for summary judgment is an interlocutory order from
    which no appeal lies to this court.  The statements or findings made by the
    motion judge to the effect that the appellants failed to make out certain
    defences to the claim are <i>obiter</i>, they do not bind the parties and
    this court has no jurisdiction to entertain an appeal against them: <i>V.K.
    Mason Construction Ltd. v. Canadian General Insurance Group Ltd. </i>(1998),
    42 O.R. (3d) 618 (C.A.).</p>
  <h3><i><span style='font-weight:normal'>3.  Issue estoppel</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    come now to issue estoppel which, in my view, is dispositive of the remaining
    issues on this appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    doctrine of issue estoppel precludes a party from relitigating a legal or
    factual issue that has been conclusively resolved in a prior proceeding.  The
    doctrine rests on the finality principle, “a compelling consideration” that
    ordinarily limits a litigant “to one bite at the cherry”: <i>Danyluk v. Ainsworth</i>,
    [2001] 2 S.C.R. 460, at paras. 18-19.  Once a point has been decided, the
    winning litigant is entitled to rely on the result, to be assured of peace
    and to be able to plan the future on the basis of the court’s decision.  The
    finality principle is fundamental to a secure legal order.  It avoids “duplicative
    litigation, potentially inconsistent results, undue costs, and inconclusive
    proceedings”: <i>Danyluk</i>, at para. 18. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the other hand, issue estoppel “is a doctrine of public policy that is designed
    to advance the interests of justice” and where the application of issue estoppel
    would itself produce an injustice, courts have a discretion to relieve against
    it: <i>Danyluk</i>, at para. 19.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Danyluk</i>,<i> </i>the
    Supreme Court of Canada set out a two-step test designed to ensure that issue
    estoppel and the finality principle are applied so that justice is done.  At
    para. 33, Binnie J., for the Court, held:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The rules governing issue estoppel should not be
    mechanically applied.  The underlying purpose is to balance the public interest
    in the finality of litigation with the public interest in ensuring that justice
    is done on the facts of a particular case.  (There are corresponding private
    interests.)&nbsp; The first step is to determine whether the moving party…  has
    established the preconditions to the operation of issue estoppel….<i> </i>If
    successful, the court must still determine whether, as a matter of discretion,
    issue estoppel <i>ought</i> to be applied. [Emphasis in original; citations
    omitted.] </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Binnie
    J. held, at para. 25, that the preconditions at the first stage of the test
    are those set out by Dickson J. in <i>Angle v. Minister of National Revenue</i>,
    [1975] 2 S.C.R. 248, at p. 254: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;  that the same question has been
    decided; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp; that the judicial decision which
    is said to create the estoppel was final; and,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3) &nbsp;that the parties to the judicial decision
    or their privies were the same persons as the parties to the proceedings
    in which the estoppel is raised or their privies.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the prior determination that the appellants are not entitled to
    a stay on account of the arbitration clauses meets all three requirements. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the same question was decided when this court held in 2005 that the appellants
    were not entitled to a stay and that the issue of whether the dispute should
    be resolved by way of arbitration or class proceedings was a matter to be
    decided at the “preferable procedure” stage of the certification hearing.  The
    certification judge rejected the contention that arbitration was preferable
    to a class proceeding and the appellants exhausted their rights of appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the decision on that issue was final.  The appellants’ application for leave
    to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed, the matter proceeded
    to certification and the appellants’ application for leave to appeal the
    certification order was also dismissed.  While the claim of the respondents
    has yet to be resolved on its merits and, in that sense, remains “in the
    system”, the issue of arbitration or class proceeding has been finally resolved
    and is no longer in play. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    third requirement that the parties or their privies are the same is now subject
    to the abuse of process doctrine: see
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <i>Toronto</i><i> (City) v. C.U.P.E</i>., [2003] 2 S.C.R. 77. In any event,
    it is clear here that the parties are the same and that the third requirement
    is met. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:black'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    turn to the second stage of the <i>Danyluk</i> test, namely, whether, as
    a matter of discretion, issue estoppel <i>ought</i> to be applied.  The appellants
    submit that the change in the law brought on by <i>Dell</i> and <i>Rogers</i> entitles
    them to avoid the prior determination and to relitigate the stay issue and
    that the motion judge erred in exercising his discretion against them.  Strong
    reliance is placed on the following sentence from <i>Minott v. O’Shanter
    Development Co.</i><span style='color:black'> (1999), 42 O.R. (3d) 321 (
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), at p. 340: “If the decision of a court on a point of law in an earlier
    proceeding is shown to be wrong by a later judicial decision, issue estoppel
    will not prevent relitigating that issue in subsequent proceedings.”  That
    sentence, however, must be read in the context in which it is found at pp.
    340-41:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Issue estoppel is a rule of public policy and,
    as a rule of public policy, it seeks to balance the public interest in the
    finality of litigation with the private interest in achieving justice between
    litigants.  Sometimes these two interests will be in conflict, or at least
    there will be tension between them. Judicial discretion is required to achieve
    practical justice without undermining the principles on which issue estoppel
    is founded.  Issue estoppel should be applied flexibly where an unyielding
    application of it would be unfair to a party who is precluded from relitigating
    an issue.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>That the courts have always exercised this discretion
    is apparent from the authorities.  For example, courts have refused to apply
    issue estoppel in “special circumstances”, which include a change in the
    law or the availability of further relevant material.  <i>If the decision
    of a court on a point of law in an earlier proceeding is shown to be wrong
    by a later judicial decision, issue estoppel will not prevent relitigating
    that issue in subsequent proceedings.  </i>It would be unfair to do otherwise<i>.  </i>In <i>Arnold
    v. National Westminster Bank plc</i>, [1991] 3 All E.R. 41 at p. 50 (H.L.),
    Lord Keith wrote:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            . . . there may be an exception to
    issue estoppel in the special circumstance that there has become available
    to a party further material relevant to the correct determination of a point
    involved in the earlier proceedings, whether or not that point was specifically
    raised and decided, being material which could not by reasonable diligence
    have been adduced in those proceedings.  One of the purposes of estoppel
    being to work justice between the parties, it is open to courts to recognise
    that in special circumstances inflexible application of it may have the opposite
    result . . . [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Particularly
    when read in the light of <i>Danyluk</i>, <i>Minott</i> does not lay down
    an iron-clad guarantee that a litigant who has fought an issue and lost will
    always be accorded the benefit of a change in the law.  A litigant has no
    automatic or presumptive right to relitigate an issue on account of a change
    in the law: the matter rests upon the discretion of the court to ensure that
    the finality principle is applied in a manner consistent with the interests
    of justice.  The “special circumstances” qualification on issue estoppel
    from <i>Minott </i>and <i>Arnold</i> is consistent with<i> Danyluk.</i>  It
    qualifies the rigorous application of issue estoppel, not with another strict
    exception, but rather with a discretion to ensure that the interests of justice
    are met.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, in the circumstances of this case, the motion judge did not err

    reasons, I conclude that this loss is clearly outweighed by the adverse consequences
    to the respondents of revisiting the stay issue at this late stage in the
    proceedings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants strongly rely on <i>Hockin v. Bank of
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    British Columbia</i> (1995), 123 D.L.R. (4th) 538 (B.C.C.A.), a case which,
    in my view, is distinguishable.  There, employees claimed surplus funds in
    a pension fund.  It had been determined on a preliminary point of law that
    the employer was entitled to the funds.  That decision was affirmed by the
    Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Canada denied leave to appeal.  Before
    the remaining issues came to trial, the Supreme Court of Canada decided another
    appeal and expressly disagreed with the Court of Appeal’s decision in <i>Hockin</i> that
    the employer was entitled to the surplus.  On appeal by the employees from
    a decision that they were bound by the prior determination under the doctrine
    of issue estoppel, the Court of Appeal held, at paras. 35-36, that the “special
    circumstances” referred to in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Arnold</i> were met, that the employees should not be “denied a hearing

    I acknowledge that <i>Dell</i> and <i>Rogers </i>characterize the contractual
    right to arbitrate as a substantive right, one must not lose sight of the
    fact that, in the end, it is a right to have a dispute resolved by way of
    a different process.  Although the application of issue estoppel will deprive
    the appellants of that right, the loss of this right is considerably less
    serious than in <i>Hockin</i>.  There, issue estoppel went to the merits
    of the claim and effectively deprived the employees of any remedy.  In a
    class proceeding, the appellants would not be denied any defence to the claim
    that they could raise in arbitration.  Simply put, although the appellants
    would lose the right to arbitrate, they would suffer no loss of rights in
    relation to the merits of the claim.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, the loss of the appellants’ right to arbitrate pales into insignificance
    when measured against the impact that a contrary ruling would have on the
    respondents.  Such a ruling would force the respondents to radically alter
    the scope of the class proceeding to exclude those claims that are subject
    to arbitration clauses and to forgo all or part of the significant cost of
    advancing the class proceeding to its present stage.  The respondents’ efforts
    to this point would be forgone in the name of individual arbitration, a procedure
    that has no air of practical reality given the nature of the claims they
    advance.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-GB>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    the certification judge observed, the claim of each class member is small.  For
    instance, the representative plaintiff’s claim is for $83.  As the certification
    judge found, it is simply not economically feasible to arbitrate a claim
    of that size.  In addition, some of the loan agreements signed by the representative
    plaintiff preclude the <span lang=EN-GB>“joinder or consolidation of claims
    with other persons…
    without the consent of the parties” and other agreements contain class action
    waivers.  When asked during oral argument, counsel for the appellants could
    not assure us that their clients would agree to waive their right to object
    to any form of joinder or consolidated arbitration.  It is almost certainly
    the case that a stay would defeat the claims subject to arbitration clauses,
    not on the merits but for reasons of practicality.  E</span>nforcing the
    arbitration clauses would not lead to arbitration but would immunize the
    appellants from any claims.  This is hardly a compelling case for the exercise
    of judicial discretion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore,
    even if the claims subject to arbitration clauses were stayed, the appellants
    would almost certainly still have to defend a reconstituted class action
    by the class of borrowers who did not sign similar agreements or who signed
    agreements after the <i>Consumer Protection Act, 2002</i> provisions came
    into force.  <span lang=EN-GB>I fail to see the justice in an exercise of
    discretion that would stay these claims at this late stage.  It would surely
    be in the interests of justice to have all claims resolved in one proceeding.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would also weigh in the balance the fact that the appellants appear to lack
    a genuine interest in arbitration.  As the certification judge found, they
    never seek arbitration when enforcing their own rights and routinely bring
    court actions against borrowers to enforce the loan agreements.  It is difficult
    to avoid the inference that the appellants insist upon arbitration, not with
    any serious intention of arbitrating, but simply as a way to defeat the respondents’ class
    proceeding.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    conclude that the motion judge did not err in exercising his discretion in
    favour of applying issue estoppel in the circumstances of this case.  Even
    if <i>Dell</i> and <i>Rogers</i> would now compel a court to stay a class
    proceeding in the face of a consumer agreement providing for arbitration,
    when all of the circumstances of this case are considered, I agree with the
    motion judge that it would not be unjust to apply issue estoppel and to hold
    the appellants to the prior determination. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    note in passing that Brown J. reached a similar conclusion in <i>MacKinnon
    v. National Money Mart</i>, (2008), <span class=documentbody>293 D.L.R. (4th)
    478</span> (B.C.S.C.), leave to appeal to B.C.C.A. granted (2008), 295 D.L.R.
    (4th) 304.  While a stay was granted following <i>Dell </i>and <i>Rogers</i> in <i>Frey
    v. Bell Mobility Inc</i>., 2008 SKQB 79, Gerein J. noted at para. 10 that
    although he had determined before <i>Dell </i>and <i>Rogers</i> were decided
    that a class proceeding was preferable to arbitration, the certification
    motion was “in limbo” and had been adjourned <i>sine die</i>, so issue estoppel
    did not arise.  For the reasons discussed above, the same cannot be said
    in this case.</p>

lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
    if the <i>Consumer Protection Act, 2002</i> provisions do not have retroactive
    effect and even if the Supreme Court of Canada’s decisions in <i>Dell</i> and <i>Rogers</i> have
    changed the law in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario, I conclude that the doctrine of issue estoppel precludes the appellants
    from relitigating the issue of whether this action should be stayed on account
    of the arbitration clauses.  The appellants have fully litigated the issue
    all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada and lost.  Following that loss,
    the action proceeded to certification, discovery and it is now set down for
    trial.  It would be fundamentally unjust at this late stage of the proceedings
    to grant the appellants a stay that would not, in fact, send this case to
    arbitration but rather would have the effect of denying any remedy to borrowers
    who are subject to arbitration clauses.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I would dismiss the appellants’ appeal against the motion judge’s refusal
    to grant a stay and decertify the class proceeding as well as their appeal
    from the order dismissing the respondents’ motion for summary judgment.  If
    the parties are unable to resolve the issue of costs, we will entertain written
    submissions from the respondents within twenty days of the release of this
    judgment and from the appellants within ten days thereafter. </p>
