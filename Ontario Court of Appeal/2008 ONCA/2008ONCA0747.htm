    Mathisen admitted causing his wife’s death.  But he testified that he did
    not mean to kill her.  He defended the charge against him on the basis of
    self-defence, necessity and accident.  He claimed that his wife had been
    trying to kill him, by poisoning him and by setting a fire in their house,
    and that their altercation began when he confronted her and tried to obtain
    information about the poison or an antidote.  He testified that during their
    confrontation his wife said to him: “why can’t you just die like an ordinary
    person”, and “you’re a dead man.”  He relied on the evidence of a pathologist
    who testified that Jane Mathisen’s death was consistent with traumatic asphyxia.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

      for 24 years.  They had three children: two boys and a girl; the youngest

      165 pounds.  During the trial, witnesses repeatedly described Mr. Mathisen
      as friendly and humorous, and as a man of integrity.  He was not known
      to be violent.  In contrast, the three children described their mother
      as erratic, easily angered and sometimes violent.  </span></p>

      rekindle their relationship by taking a cruise together, but to no avail.  Mrs.
      Mathisen apparently found her husband’s weight gain because of thyroid
      cancer “rather unappealing”.  Their marital difficulties were no doubt
      exacerbated by their financial difficulties.  According to a family friend, “the
      entire time of, of knowing Peter and Jane they, they seemed to have a lack
      of finances.  That was not, that was not a new circumstance”.  Eventually
      Mrs. Mathisen decided to end the marriage.</span></p>

      their affair quickly evolved into phone calls or visits “almost every other

      August 2001, Mr. Mathisen became suspicious that his wife was having an
      affair.  He noticed a change in her.  She began to buy “fancier clothes”,
      wear more makeup and go out in the evenings.  In mid-September, before
      leaving on a business trip to the

    she had been seeing another man, though she insisted that he was just a friend.  Mr.
    Mathisen gave her an ultimatum:  they could either separate or make their
    marriage work.  He asked her to consider what she wanted to do while he was

      like “a gentleman”.  Throughout the meeting Mr. Mathisen was very polite.  He
      asked Mr. Peloza to stop seeing his wife because he still hoped to make
      their relationship work.  Mr. Peloza said “he would see what he could do”.  However,

    she offered to make him a cup of hot chocolate.  He accepted, viewing it

      wife had not served him food in years.  She offered him a second cup, which
      he refused.  Later he took a sample of the hot chocolate in a stool sample

    he had purchased at the airport.  Although she did not drink, she nonetheless
    asked about the taste of different alcohols.  She urged him to buy some Amaretto,
    which she said had an almond taste.  He found her questions bizarre and suspicious.</span></p>

      telephoned him to suggest that if he came home for lunch he should eat

      him to remove his wife as beneficiary under his life insurance policy.  He
      asked the agent to substitute his children as beneficiaries.  The employee

      problems.  They had liabilities of $55,000 and assets of only $18,000,
      including the equity in their home.  Jane Mathisen raised the issue of
      spousal support.  Peter Mathisen responded by telling his wife that he
      had secretly taped her telephone conversations with Bill Peloza and that
      two of the children had listened to them.  He gave her one of the tapes.  He

      that they could divorce immediately and that “she’d be lucky to get a kitchen

  <h3><span lang=EN-US>(a)       Dr. Rao’s Observations and Opinion</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    examining Jane Mathisen, Dr. Rao concluded that she had died from manual
    strangulation and blunt force to the body.  Dr. Rao’s examination revealed
    the following: Jane Mathisen had blunt force injury to her head, face and
    ears.  She had bruising on her chest, hands, arms and right shoulder.  She
    had haemorrhages
    – from pressure being applied to her chest or neck – on her cheeks, chin,
    eyes and epiglottis.  She also had five broken ribs on her left side, although
    her right ribs were intact.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Rao examined Jane Mathisen’s neck.  Mrs. Mathisen had some bruising on the
    muscles and tissues inside her neck.  In Dr. Rao’s opinion, this bruising
    was consistent with manual strangulation.  However, none of the bones in
    Mrs. Mathisen’s neck were broken.  She also had no finger marks, abrasions
    or any other injuries on the outside of her neck.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Rao acknowledged that in most cases of manual strangulation, bones in the
    neck are broken.  However, she maintained that the absence of neck fractures
    does not rule out manual strangulation, even for older persons.  Whether
    the neck bones will be fractured depends on the amount and place of pressure
    and whether the victim’s bones are brittle. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Rao also acknowledged that resuscitation attempts might account for the internal
    bruising on Jane Mathisen’s neck.  However, in her experience, only rarely
    does intubation cause bruising to the face and neck, and then only where
    the intubation was difficult.  Moreover, in her opinion, intubation could
    not account for the extensive bruising observed on Jane Mathisen. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Rao ruled out traumatic asphyxia as the sole cause of death, largely because
    of the internal bruising to Jane Mathisen’s neck.  However, she also said
    that in cases of traumatic or compression asphyxia she would expect to see
    massive haemorrhaging of the eyes, nose and mouth, and blueing above the
    area of compression.  These were not present in this case.  </p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr. <span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      Dr. Shkrum’s opinion, the bruising on Jane Mathisen’s chest and her internal
      injuries were consistent with traumatic asphyxia.  He added that human
      responses to trauma – for example, struggling or taking deep breathes – enhance
      the force of the compression.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Also

lang=EN-US>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    Dr. Shkrum said that the findings of the autopsy were consistent with traumatic
    asphyxia.  Although he knew of only a few case reports where one individual
    had inflicted traumatic asphyxia on another, in his view, Jane Mathisen could
    possibly have died merely because of her husband’s weight on her during their
    struggle on the floor:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-US>Q.        Would your findings be, Sir, consistent with an individual,
      a large individual weighing about 380 pounds claiming that he had kneeled
      on the chest of a 165 pound woman being Jan[e] Mathisen?</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-US>A.        Well as I indicated in my opinion to you that unfortunately
      there isn’t a lot of literature on this particular topic of individuals
      lying on someone else and causing their death.  Certainly in the classic
      examples of traumatic asphyxia there’s usually some type of large object,
      like a car or heavy machinery or someone being pinned in machinery and
      suffering traumatic asphyxia.  But there are only a few case reports that
      detail traumatic asphyxia inflicted by another individual.  So, I would
      say yes the death is consistent with traumatic asphyxia and it is possible
      for an individual of a large size laying on another person of a smaller
      size to cause their death by traumatic asphyxia.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Dr.
      Shkrum also suggested that the compressional force from kneeling on another
      person increases the likelihood of death and decreases the time for death
      to occur.  </span></p>

      air of reality and that the trial judge erred in law by failing to leave
      them for the jury’s consideration.  Sections 34(1), 34(2) and 37 of the <i>Criminal

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span

      different scenarios potentially gave rise to Mr. Mathisen’s claim of self-defence.  The
      first scenario arose from Mr. Mathisen’s belief that his wife was trying
      to kill him by setting the fire in their kitchen and by trying to poison
      him.  He claimed that her attempts to poison him drove him to restrain
      her and do what was necessary to obtain the antidote and thus save his
      own life.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      second scenario arose from Mr. Mathisen’s physical struggle with his wife
      at the door when he tried to prevent her from leaving, and she swung at
      him with her keys.  These two scenarios overlapped, but the “assault” triggering
      the claim of self-defence differed.  In the first scenario, the assault
      was his wife’s ongoing attempt to kill him, especially by poisoning him;
      in the second scenario, it was Jane Mathisen’s attempt to hit her husband
      with her keys.</span></p>

      trial judge ruled that the self-defence provisions did not apply to the
      first scenario because, under the <i>Criminal Code</i>, a poisoning does
      not constitute an assault.   He also held that ss. 34(1) and 34(2) had
      no air of reality under the second scenario.  In this court, Mr. Mathisen
      focused his submission on the first scenario.  I will do so as well in
      these reasons, as I agree with the trial judge that self-defence under
      the first scenario – either under s. 34(1) or under s. 34(2) – had no air

      defence should be put to the jury only if it is sound in law and meets
      the air of reality test.  The air of reality test requires that there be
      evidence in the record on which a properly instructed jury, acting reasonably,
      could acquit: see <i>R. v. Cinous</i>,  [2002] 2 S.C.R. 3.  In applying
      the air of reality test, a trial judge assumes that the evidence the accused
      relies on is true.  Moreover, the trial judge does not decide the substantive
      merits of the defence, weigh the evidence, make findings of fact or credibility,
      or draw firm factual inferences: see <i>Cinous</i> at paras. 53-54.</span></p>

      each of the elements in ss. 34(1) and (2) has both a subjective and an
      objective component.  The subjective component is the accused’s perception

    his ruling on the defences to be left to the jury, the trial judge held that “a

    ruling is legally correct because under the <i>Code</i> an assault as defined
    in s. 265 and administering a noxious substance under s. 245 are distinct
    offences.  The Crown points out that historically the common law differentiated
    between an act of poisoning and an act of assault: see <i>R. v. Smith</i>,
    [1874] O.J. No. 28 (Q.B.).  Thus, as there was no “assault”
    to trigger s. 34(1), the trial judge was right not to leave this self-defence

    37 provides a broader basis for self-defence than s. 34(1).  To take advantage
    of s. 37, Mr. Mathisen need only show that he reasonably believed he was
    being assaulted and that the force he used to defend himself was not more
    than necessary to prevent the assault or the repetition of it.  Unlike s.
    34(1), Mr. Mathisen could rely on s. 37 even if he provoked the assault and
    even if he intended to kill or seriously injure his wife.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    even though the trial judge had ruled that a poisoning could not constitute
    an assault, in his instructions on s. 37 he told the jury otherwise.  The
    trial judge instructed the jury that in determining whether Mr. Mathisen
    reasonably believed he was being assaulted, it should consider the evidence
    Mrs. Mathisen had poisoned her husband and had set a fire in the kitchen:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The issue is whether he reasonably believed, in
    the circumstances as he knew them to be, that he was being assaulted.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>You should look at his words and conduct before,
    at the time and after he used force against her.  And you should look at
    her words and actions at the time and after she used force against him.  All
    these things, and the circumstances in which they happened, may shed light
    on his state of mind at the time.  They may help you decide what he reasonably
    believed.  You should look at the other evidence relevant to his belief.  This
    includes evidence that she had poisoned him or that he believed she had,
    both that day and previously, that she had set the kitchen fire to harm or
    get rid of him, that he had inhaled smoke from the fire, that he had little
    or no sleep that day or the night before, and that if it was not a poison
    she had given him, it may have been the blood pressure medication, he may
    have been upset over the matrimonial breakup, and consider the evidence of
    his reputation for not being violent or aggressive, and his evidence as to
    her disposition for being violent and the evidence of her children supporting
    that.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    few moments later, in discussing whether Mr. Mathisen used more force than
    necessary, the trial judge again invited the jury to consider the evidence
    of poisoning and setting a fire:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This question requires you to consider the relationship
    between the assault by Mrs. Mathisen and the force used by him to defend
    himself against it. </p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In assessing his beliefs as to what was appropriate,
    take into account all of the circumstances as to what both of them said or
    did.  Take into account as well the other evidence which may be relevant
    to his belief.  This includes his evidence that she had poisoned him or that
    he believed she had, both that day and previously, his belief that she had
    set fire to the kitchen to harm or get rid of him, that he had inhaled smoke
    and/or carbon monoxide from the fire, that he had had little or no sleep
    that day or the night before, that if it was not a poison she had given him
    it may have been the blood pressure medication, his upset over the matrimonial
    breakup, and  the evidence of his reputation for not being aggressive or
    violent, and his evidence of her disposition to be violent and the evidence
    of her children supporting that.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    the substance of Mr. Mathisen’s claim of self-defence under s. 34(1) was
    left for the jury under s. 37 of the <i>Code</i>.  The trial judge gave the
    jury a broad basis on which to acquit the accused because of self-defence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    if s. 34(1) is available, is it reversible error to leave only s. 37?  In <i>R.
    v.  McIntosh</i>, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 686, the Supreme Court of
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    discussed Parliament’s intention in enacting s. 37.  Lamer C.J., writing
    for the majority, noted at para. 44 that s. 37’s broad justification appears
    to render s. 34 redundant.  He suggested, at para. 45, that s. 37 serves
    a “gap-filling role, providing the basis for self-defence where ss. 34 and
    35 are not applicable.”  In dissent, McLachlin J. restricted the role of
    s. 37 even more, holding at para. 84 that s. 37 should not apply where death
    or grievous bodily harm occurs.  In such cases, the more specific self-defence
    provisions, s. 34 or s. 35, should govern.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accepting
    that limitation on the use of s. 37, it seems to me, nonetheless, that the
    question on appeal is this: assuming s. 34(1) were available, was Mr. Mathisen
    prejudiced by the trial judge’s failure to leave this provision with the
    jury?  In my view, the answer is no.  Mr. Mathisen was not prejudiced because
    of the trial judge’s thorough and fair instructions on s. 37.  Those instructions
    put Mr. Mathisen’s claim at least as well as it could have been put under
    s. 34(1).  Mr. Ruby, in his candid argument for Mr. Mathisen, acknowledged
    as much: see <i>R. v. Grandin</i> (2001), 154 C.C.C. (3d) 408, where the
    British Columbia Court of Appeal took a similar approach.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    concluding this part, I emphasize that I have not found that the trial judge
    erred by failing to leave s. 34(1) with the jury.  I have concluded only
    that if s. 34(1) were available, the trial judge’s instructions on s. 37
    cured any prejudice that would have flowed from his failure to leave s. 34(1).</p>
  <h3>(d)       Section 34(2)</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Mathisen’s main complaint about the self-defence instructions is the trial
    judge’s failure to leave s. 34(2) with the jury.  The justification afforded
    by s. 34(2) has three elements:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Mathisen reasonably believed that he was being unlawfully assaulted by Mrs.
    Mathisen;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Mathisen caused Mrs. Mathisen’s death because he reasonably feared that she
    would kill or seriously injury him; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Mathisen reasonably believed that he had no other way to save his life.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
    the trial judge concluded that a “surreptitious poisoning” cannot constitute
    an assault under s. 34, he did not leave s. 34(2) with the jury on the scenario
    I have been discussing: Mrs. Mathisen’s ongoing attempts to kill her husband
    by poisoning him and by setting a fire in their house.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Mathisen contends that this was an error in law, that s. 34(2) had an air
    of reality, and that accordingly it should have been left for the jury’s
    consideration.  He makes the valid point that s. 34(2), unlike s. 37, applies
    even when an accused uses more force than is necessary to prevent the assault.  This
    might have been an important consideration for the jury as Mr. Mathisen was
    so much taller and weighed so much more than his wife.  Moreover, s. 34(2)
    is available for an accused, such as Mr. Mathisen, who disclaims any intention
    to kill the victim: see <i>R. v. Pintar</i> (1996), 110 C.C.C. (3d) 402 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">

    ) at p. 433.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    in my view, the trial judge did not err in refusing to leave s. 34(2) with
    the jury.  Even if Mrs. Mathisen’s alleged ongoing acts of poisoning and
    setting a fire amounted to an assault, at a minimum the third element of
    s. 34(2) had no air of reality.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    meet the air of reality test, the third element requires some evidence that
    Mr. Mathisen actually believed he had no other way to save himself and some
    evidence that his belief was reasonable.  Even accepting that Mr. Mathisen
    believed his only course of action was to do what he did, that belief was
    not reasonably based.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If,
    as Mr. Mathisen testified, his goal was to obtain an antidote and prevent
    his wife from further harming him, he had many alternatives other than restraining
    her from leaving the house.  He could have let her go; he could have locked
    the doors; he could have called 9-1-1; he could have gone to a doctor, or
    to the hospital, or to a poison centre.  He did none of these things.  At
    least objectively, his conduct does not satisfy the air of reality test under
    the third prong of s. 34(2).  The trial judge was right not to leave s. 34(2)
    with the jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h3>2.         Did the trial judge err by failing to properly instruct the
    jury on the defence of accident?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> At
    trial, Mr. Mathisen relied on the defence of accident.  He said that he did
    not intend to kill his wife; her death was accidental.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the criminal law “accident” is used in two senses: it refers either to an
    unintended act (accident as to the <i>actus
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    reus</i>) or to unintended consequences.  Mr. Mathisen relies on both senses
    of accident.  He claims that he did not intend the act that killed his wife.  Alternatively,
    he claims that if he intended the act, he did not intend its consequence:
    his wife’s death.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge instructed the jury on accident in the sense of unintended consequences,
    but he did not instruct on accident in the sense of an unintended act.  Mr.
    Mathisen submits that his failure to do so amounts to an error of law requiring
    a new trial.  I agree with that submission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge dealt with Mr. Mathisen’s claim that he did not intend to kill
    his wife by thoroughly and accurately instructing the jury on the mental
    element of the offence of murder.  For example, the trial judge told the
    jury:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The crime of murder requires proof of a particular
    state of mind.  For an unlawful killing to be murder, Crown counsel must
    prove that Mr. Mathisen meant either to kill Mrs. Mathisen or meant to cause
    her bodily harm that Mr. Mathisen knew was likely to kill her, and was reckless
    whether she died or not – that is, that he saw the likelihood that she could
    die from the injury, but went ahead anyway and took the chance.  The Crown
    does not have to prove both.  One is enough.  All of you do not have to agree
    on the same state of mind, as long as everyone is sure that at least one
    of the required states of mind has been proven beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No
    further instruction was required to put before the jury Mr. Mathisen’s defence
    of an unintended consequence.  That defence is nothing more than an argument
    that Mr. Mathisen lacked the <i>mens rea</i> for murder.  As Justice Watt
    points out in his <i>Watt’s Manual of Criminal Jury Instructions</i> (
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto: Thomson Carswell, 2005) at 780, accident in the sense of an unintended
    consequence is best handled as part of the mental element of the offence
    charged.  That is what the trial judge did.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    Mr. Mathisen says not only that did he not intend to kill his wife, but also
    that he did not even intend the act that resulted in her death.  The criminal
    law punishes people for their conscious voluntary acts.  Therefore, if Mr.
    Mathisen did not intend to commit the act that killed his wife, he is not
    guilty of murder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defence theory was that Mrs. Mathisen died of traumatic asphyxia.  Based
    on the expert evidence, that defence had an air of reality.  Only two acts
    could have caused Mrs. Mathisen’s death by traumatic asphyxia: Mr. Mathisen
    put his knee on his wife’s chest and kept it there; or, Mr. Mathisen continually
    sat on his wife’s chest.  Thus, the pivotal question is whether there was
    an air of reality to Mr. Mathisen’s contention that, if he committed either
    act, he did so unintentionally.  If there was an air of reality, the jury
    should have been instructed on accident as to the <i>actus
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    reus</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge was well aware of the distinction between unintended acts and
    unintended consequences.  In his ruling on “Defences to be Left to the Jury”,
    he began the section “The Defence of Accident” with the following sentence:
    “Accident may arise in the sense that the <i>actus
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    reus</i> was unintended, or in the sense that the consequences were unintended
    and not foreseen.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the trial judge’s view of the evidence, accident as to the <i>actus
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    reus</i> had no air of reality.  After referring to two cases where accused
    claimed the <i>actus
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    reus</i> was unintended, the trial judge said
    “[t]hat is not the claim here as [Mr. Mathisen] has testified that he intended
    to apply the physical acts that he did, but that he did not intend the consequences
    and that they were accidental.”  The trial judge, therefore, concluded that: “[T]here
    is no air of reality, and indeed the evidence is contradictory, to any claim
    for accident as a defence in respect of the application of the force, as
    opposed to its result.  Accident will not be left as a separate defence.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Indeed,
    in his charge, the trial judge invited the jury to find that, when Mr. Mathisen
    kneeled on his wife’s chest, he committed an assault because he applied force
    to her intentionally, not accidentally:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Either a manual strangulation or a compression
    asphyxiation by kneeling on a person’s chest could be an assault.  An assault
    is the intentional application of force, directly or indirectly, to another
    person without her consent.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Some types of assaultive actions are objectively
    dangerous.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Kneeling on another person’s chest may be of this
    less obvious category, and require a careful consideration of the relative
    sizes of the two persons, and of the duration of the period of kneeling.  If
    you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Mathisen strangled her
    or kneeled on her chest in a manner that was objectively likely to cause
    harm or injury, and thereby caused her death, then either would be an assault
    and hence an unlawful act, unless you have a reasonable doubt as to whether
    it was done in self defence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Defence
    counsel appeared to concur with the trial judge’s position.  In the pre-charge
    discussions, the trial judge asked defence counsel what form of accident
    he wanted left with the jury.  Defence counsel, who seemed more focused on
    the defences of necessity and self-defence than on accident, replied that
    he would be content with an instruction on intent.  Defence counsel reiterated
    this position in his closing address.  In putting forward the defence of
    self-defence, defence counsel told the jury that, though Mr. Mathisen kneeled
    on his wife, he did so to preserve his own life; he did not intend the consequences
    of his kneeling:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In his panicked mind the only way to ensure his
    safety was to hold her down.  She was furious, she was very dangerous.  Was
    the force he was using out of proportion?  Again, perhaps in the cold light
    of day, but not to Peter in his circumstances.  From his perspective he is
    kneeling on her to prevent a continuation of her destructive, assaultive
    behaviour.  He’s kneeling on her with one knee.  He is not continuously beating
    her.  He is not kicking her.  He is not trying to use a weapon.  He is not
    reacting simply out of rage.  Let’s face it, at 380 pounds he could have
    administered a horrible beating but despite everything that happened he did
    not.  He kneeled on Jane Mathisen.  The consequences of Jane Mathisen’s death
    caused by the kneeling were unintended.  I submit to you, if you look at
    the force applied by Peter in the circumstances which was kneeling on his
    wife with one knee, which I suggest in his unique desperate circumstances
    is an appropriate use of force to defence (sic) himself.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly,
    in her factum in this court, Crown counsel maintained, as had the trial Crown,
    that even after falling to the floor Mr. Mathisen “was actively sitting on
    his wife – intentionally applying force to her
    – in an effort to restrain her … [t]he [a]ppellant’s use of his knee in effecting
    this purpose may not have been done with calm measure, and may, according
    to the defence theory, not have been intended to kill her, but it was no
    accident.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    have read and re-read Mr. Mathisen’s evidence.  And I do not view it in the
    way the trial judge or defence counsel viewed it.  Unquestionably, Mr. Mathisen
    intended to restrain his wife.  However, although his evidence is perhaps
    equivocal, in several parts of his testimony Mr. Mathisen said or suggested
    that, though he intended to restrain his wife, he did not intend to kneel
    on his wife’s chest or sit on her, and did not realize he had done so until
    after she was dead. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Obviously
    the confrontation between Mr. Mathisen and his wife was emotionally charged.  Mr.
    Mathisen acknowledged that he did not completely remember exactly what happened
    between the time he fell on his wife and the time he got off of her.  Early
    in his evidence in chief, however, he discussed in some detail his fight
    with his wife and then what occurred after they fell to the floor.  In this
    part of his evidence, he appeared to say that he did not appreciate he had
    put his knee on his wife’s chest:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I got off balance and we both fell right down onto
    the floor.  I landed on top of her and she kept wriggling around and pushing
    and shoving and kicking.  When – in previous years when she absolutely loved
    to wrestle, I would get her down on the floor and I would sit astride her
    legs and hold her arms and now she’s basically unable to move and I would
    wait until she settled down and I waited.  In those times I’d wait and then
    when she settled down I’d let her go, well in many cases she “played possum”,
    and waited ‘til I let go and then she started again.  Well in this particular
    case I couldn’t sit astride her because her leg, her one leg was up because
    she was right across the hallway and the hallway’s not that big.  <u>So I
    guess I must have in that desperation put my knee on her</u>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Later
    in his evidence in chief, after testifying about discovering that his wife
    was not moving anymore, Mr. Mathisen was asked: “And what part of your body
    is on her body, sir?”  He answered: “Well I look down and I found my left
    knee on top of her chest.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
    if these passages might be said to be ambiguous, there was no ambiguity in
    two later parts of Mr. Mathisen’s evidence.  After stating that his “main
    restraint was holding her arms”, Mr. Mathisen was asked directly: “Did you
    use anything other than your hands, sir, during the course of this struggle?”,
    to which he responded “No.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And,
    again on cross-examination, Mr. Mathisen repeated his testimony that he did
    not appreciate he had been kneeling on his wife’s chest until after she was
    dead:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        All right.  Sir I’m going to suggest
    that this foggy if not absent memory and while you were on top of your wife
    causing her death is nothing but a convenient explanation for not being able
    to tell us what really happened.  Isn’t that the case?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        I was holding her down, I was holding
    her arms and I had my knee on her chest and I was just trying to hold her
    still.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        I thought you said yesterday you must
    have had your knee on her chest?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        No I looked down after the fact and saw
    the knee there.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Admittedly,
    another passage from Mr. Mathisen’s evidence suggestes that he kneeled on
    his wife deliberately.  This occurs in the following exchange:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        All right.  Now, Sir, you had earlier
    admitted and talked about how you had kneeled on Mrs. Mathisen during the
    course of her struggle?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        Yes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        And how you observed at one point that
    she had stopped moving.  And your intent, Sir, upon kneeling on her?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        I was just trying to restrain her.  I
    wanted to know what this, what the antidote was or what the poison was.  I
    didn’t want her to leave my presence.  I didn’t want to go back in the car,
    I didn’t want to go elsewhere in the house and find hypodermic needles or
    anything else that she might have kicking around to finish me off.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        And as we know, Sir, that struggle including
    the kneeling ended up causing Mrs. Mathisen’s death?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        Yes, I’m sorry.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>Even in this passage, however, Mr.
    Mathisen’s apparent acceptance that he deliberately kneeled on his wife may
    be attributable to the way that his counsel framed the question.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    air of reality test assumes Mr. Mathisen’s evidence to be true.  Assuming
    his testimony and the passages I have cited are true, then there is evidence
    in the record that he kneeled on his wife’s chest accidentally and did not
    realize he had done so until after she was dead.  Put differently, on this
    evidence, once they fell to the floor, his only intentional act, his only
    assault, was holding his wife’s arms down.  Thus, in my view, there is an
    air of reality to the defence of accident as to the <i>actus
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    reus</i>.  If the jury was instructed on that defence and accepted or had
    a reasonable doubt that Jane Mathisen died from compression asphyxia, it
    could have acquitted Mr. Mathisen of murder because the act that caused her
    death was accidental or unintended.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    certainly recognize that, on the question whether accident as to the <i>actus
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    reus</i> should be left with the jury, the trial judge received no help whatsoever
    from defence counsel.  Moreover, as I have already said, Mr. Mathisen’s own
    evidence on whether he kneeled on his wife’s chest accidentally is equivocal.  Some
    parts of his evidence suggest that his kneeling was accidental at least one
    part, and perhaps others, that his kneeling was intentional.  And his evidence
    is the only evidence on the issue.  However, a trier of fact is entitled
    to accept all, some or none of a witness’s testimony.  Thus, the jury could
    accept the exculpatory parts of Mr. Mathisen’s evidence, or at least conclude
    that they raised a reasonable doubt.  Accordingly, I conclude, contrary to
    the trial judge’s ruling, that the defence of an accidental act should not
    have been removed from the jury’s consideration.  The jury should have been
    charged both on unintended act and on unintended consequence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    in addition to its view of Mr. Mathisen’s evidence, the Crown puts forward
    two arguments to support the trial judge’s ruling.  First, it points out
    that Mr. Mathisen was talking to his wife throughout their struggle on the
    floor.  Their conversation, the Crown argues, belies any notion that Mr.
    Mathisen was continually kneeling on his wife accidentally.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not agree with this argument.  We have to accept that Mr. Mathisen’s evidence
    is true.  And in the charged atmosphere of his confrontation with his wife,
    I find it entirely conceivable that Mr. Mathisen continued to talk to her
    and yet did not realize that while doing so he was kneeling on her chest.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the Crown argues that the defence of accident as to the <i>actus
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    reus</i> was contrary to the defence position on necessity and self-defence,
    and for that reason defence counsel asked only for an instruction on unintended
    consequences.  Accordingly, the Crown contends we should not accede to the
    defence’s change of position on appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    also do not agree with this argument.  I do not find Mr. Mathisen’s claim
    that he kneeled on his wife accidentally to be necessarily inconsistent with
    his claim that he acted in self-defence.   He acknowledged throughout that
    he intentionally restrained his wife by pinning her down with his hands in
    order to extract information about the antidote.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    keeping from the jury a defence that has an air of reality is an error of
    law.  And it is no less an error of law because an accused or an accused’s
    counsel does not raise it at trial.  As my colleague Doherty J.A. wrote in <i>R.
    v. Austin</i> (2006), 214 C.C.C. (3d) 38 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) at para. 14 “[t]he significance of counsel’s position at trial to the merits
    of the argument on appeal will depend on the nature of the argument advanced
    on appeal.”  Here, Mr. Mathisen has made out an error of law.  At best, counsel’s
    position at trial is relevant to the application of the curative proviso
    in s. 686(1)(b)(iii) of the <i>Code</i>.  However, the Crown, who bears the
    onus of showing that no miscarriage of justice occurred, has not attempted
    to rely on the proviso.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    I do not think it can fairly be said that removing accident as to the <i>actus
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    reus</i> from the jury’s consideration caused no prejudice to Mr. Mathisen.  The
    defence of accident as to the <i>actus
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    reus</i> was important for his overall defence.  Looking at the record as
    a whole, it seems to me that “accident” was his most realistic or viable
    defence.  The obvious implication of the jury’s verdict is that Mr. Mathisen
    intended to kill his wife.  However, accident as to the <i>actus
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    reus</i> would have a new and different perspective from which to assess
    Mr. Mathisen’s actions – a different basis on which the jury could have acquitted
    Mr. Mathisen of the charge of murder.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    our case law has emphasized that accident in the sense of an unintended act
    and accident in the sense of unintended consequences are distinct defences.  Where
    both are viable, both must be put to the jury: see, for example, <i>R. v.
    Culliton</i>, 2000 CanLII 1093 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) at para. 8.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    add this: although I have found an air of reality to Mr. Mathisen’s contention
    that he kneeled on his wife’s chest accidentally, there is no doubt on his
    evidence that during their struggle on the floor he intentionally held his
    wife’s arms down.  That intentional act was an assault.  The trial judge
    would have been obliged to instruct the jurors on both the implication of
    finding the kneeling to be accidental and the holding down of Mrs. Mathisen’s
    arms to be intentional.  If, for example, Mrs. Mathisen’s death was caused
    by the accidental kneeling on her chest, but the jury was satisfied beyond
    a reasonable doubt that Mr. Mathisen’s unlawful act of holding her arms down
    subjected her to the risk of harm, then her death would yield a conviction
    for manslaughter: see <i>R. v. Tennant and Naccarato</i> (1975), 7 O.R. (2d)
    687 (C.A.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would give effect to this ground of appeal.  On this ground alone Mr. Mathisen
    is entitled to a new trial.</p>
  <h3>3.         Did the trial judge err in excluding from evidence Mr. Mathisen’s
    two videotaped statements to the police?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    his arrest and after he had consulted with counsel, Peter Mathisen gave two
    videotaped statements to the police.  The first took place five and a half
    hours after his 9-1-1 call; the second, ten and a half hours after his 9-1-1
    call.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    both statements Mr. Mathisen is very emotional and experiences several emotional
    breakdowns.  During the first interview, when told that his wife has died,
    he begins sobbing and puts his face in his hands.  Later, when asked if meant
    to kill his wife, he replies, his voice breaking, “[n]o… I live there.  She
    tried to kill me”.  During the second interview he becomes distraught on
    his realization that his wife tried to kill him.  Throughout both interviews
    Mr. Mathisen appears and sounds exhausted.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Defence
    counsel brought a pre-trial motion to adduce Mr. Mathisen’s statements as
    part of the defence case.  He argued that the statements were admissible
    to show Mr. Mathisen’s state of mind at the time he learned he had caused
    his wife’s death.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge ruled that the two videotaped statements were &ldquo;inadmissible
    at the instance of the defence&rdquo;. He referred to the judgment of the
    Supreme Court of Canada in <em>R. v. Simpson</em>, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 3 at para. 24,
    which holds that, as a general rule, an accused&rsquo;s out of court statement
    to a third person is admissible as evidence against the accused, but not
    for the accused. The trial judge also acknowledged that the rule has exceptions:
    for example, an accused may be able to introduce a prior consistent statement
    to a third person to rebut a suggestion of a recently fabricated defence
    or to show the accused&rsquo;s state of mind at a relevant time. However,
    the trial judge held he had &ldquo;not been made aware of any claim that
    the state of mind of the accused as may appear in these interviews is relevant
    to an issue at trial.&rdquo;  Still, the trial judge left it open for defence
    counsel to renew his motion should the evidence at trial unfold in a way
    that gave rise to one of the exceptions to the rule. Defence counsel did
    not bring a further motion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Now,
    on appeal, Mr. Mathisen submits that the trial judge erred in his pre-trial
    ruling excluding the two statements.  Mr. Mathisen says that his statements
    show his state of mind when first confronted by the police, his reaction
    when told for certain that his wife had died, and his demeanour when talking
    about his wife and her attempts to kill him.  He contends that his state
    of mind and the veracity of his belief that his wife tried to kill him were
    live issues for the jury.  He points out that any concerns about introducing
    his statements were reduced because he testified at trial and therefore could
    be cross-examined on them.  I do not accept Mr. Mathisen’s submission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    are important reasons for the rule precluding the defence from putting into
    evidence an accused’s prior consistent statement.  Where the accused does
    not testify, “[t]his rule is based on the sound proposition that an accused
    person should not be free to make an unsworn statement and compel its admission
    into evidence through other witnesses and thus put his defence before the
    jury without being put on oath and being subjected, as well, to cross-examination”:
    see <i>Simpson</i> at para. 24.  Even where an accused has testified, the
    fact that he or she has previously said the same thing does not make the
    accused’s trial testimony any more credible or reliable.  In other words,
    the mere repetition of a story does not enhance its truthfulness or its reliability.  The
    law views the prior statement as self-serving and superfluous: see <i>R.
    v. Curto</i> (2008), 230 C.C.C. (3d) 145 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless,
    as the trial judge recognized, the rule admits of exceptions, and one of
    those exceptions is to show the state of mind of the accused if relevant
    to an issue at trial.  Under this or any other exception, the statement is
    admissible not for the truth of its contents, but rather for the fact it
    was made and the circumstances under which it was made.  Moreover, as Doherty
    J.A. suggested in <i>R. v. Suzack and Pennett</i> (2000), 141 C.C.C. (3d)
    449 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) at para. 183, the danger in admitting a prior consistent or self-serving
    statement may be alleviated where an accused testifies and is available for
    cross-examination.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,
    Mr. Mathisen did testify, and both his state of mind when he first learned
    of his wife’s death and his belief that his wife was trying to kill were
    live issues at trial.  Nonetheless, I agree with the Crown that the trial
    judge did not err in his ruling excluding the statements.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his pre-trial motion, defence counsel did not seek to have the videotaped
    statements admitted to show the veracity of Mr. Mathisen’s belief that his
    wife was trying to kill him.  He sought to have them admitted only to show
    Mr. Mathisen’s reaction when he first learned of his wife’s death or when
    he was first accused of his wife’s death.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these purposes, the statements had no value.  When Mr. Mathisen’s first interview
    began –
    at 5:24 a.m. – he believed his wife to have been dead for more than five
    hours.  He told the 9-1-1 operator at midnight that he thought he had killed
    his wife.  He also told the first officer on the scene that his wife had
    tried to kill him and that he had killed her.  That officer arrested Mr.
    Mathisen for his wife’s murder at 12:10 a.m.  Thus, Mr. Mathisen’s statements
    to the 9-1-1 operator and the arresting officer less than one hour after
    he caused his wife’s death were far better evidence of Mr. Mathisen’s emotional
    reaction to the death of his wife and his potential liability for it, than
    his emotional reaction five hours later, and significantly, five hours after
    he had been arrested and had an opportunity to consult counsel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this court, Mr. Mathisen seeks to overturn the trial judge’s ruling by casting
    the basis for the admissibility of the statements differently: to show his
    belief that his wife was trying to kill him.  The trial judge surely cannot
    be faulted for not addressing this basis for admissibility, as it was never
    put to him. Even if it had, I do not think that it could have succeeded because,
    again, Mr. Mathisen’s statement to the 9-1-1 operator and arresting officer
    together with his own trial testimony were far better evidence of his belief.  From
    this evidence, and without the videotapes, the jury was well aware of Mr.
    Mathisen’s claim that his wife was trying to kill him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    I consider it telling against this ground of appeal that, though the trial
    judge did not foreclose the renewal of the motion to admit the videotape
    statements, defence counsel did not renew his motion.  Although this court
    will forgive an omission of counsel to prevent a miscarriage of justice,
    we will be far less inclined to do so where the omission was a deliberate
    tactical decision.  As Ms. Paine for the Crown points out, that may well
    have been the case here.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first videotaped statement raised a problem for the defence: on a key issue,
    Mr. Mathisen’s statement was inconsistent with his trial testimony.  The
    key issue was his reason for assaulting his wife.  In his statement when
    asked why he became physical with his wife he answered that he wanted to
    know why she had tried to poison him:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>M:       I said, “Now that’s the second time
    you tried to kill me.”  She goes, “No it’s not.  That’s the third time.” (Gestures
    with both hands and puts head in hand)</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>N:        Is that why you got physical?</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>M:       Um Hm.  I just wanted to know why?
    Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? </p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>N:        She didn’t give you an answer?</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>M:       Nope.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his videotaped statement, Mr. Mathisen showed no concern or urgency about
    any poisoning; he said nothing about any symptoms he was suffering.  Yet,
    in his trial evidence he testified that he sought to restrain his wife to
    get the
    “antidote”.  Thus, Mr. Mathisen’s videotaped statement would have undermined
    his defence of self-defence, which he had put forward in his trial testimony.  That
    is a credible reason why defence counsel did not renew the motion.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[112]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I

    trial judge then reviewed the evidence of Dr. Rao in considerable detail.  His
    review was balanced as he discussed both her evidence-in-chief and the arguable
    weaknesses in her evidence brought out on cross-examination.  For example,
    he reminded the jury of Dr. Rao’s concession and opinion on a central plank
    of the defence: the absence of finger marks on Jane Mathisen’s neck and the
    absence of any fracture to her neck suggested that she did not die from manual
    strangulation.  He said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>No finger marks on the neck, she agreed, no nail
    marks.  And she agreed the neck structures were intact.  She agreed they
    are often broken in a manual strangulation case but not necessarily so.  And
    the fact they are not broken does not rule out manual strangulation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
    the defence expert, Dr. Shkrum, agreed that in adults the absence of neck
    fractures does not rule out manual strangulation.  Defence counsel did not
    object to the trial judge’s review of Dr. Rao’s evidence.  The lack of an
    objection is a further indication that the trial judge’s review was fair
    and accurate.  I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h3>5.         Other grounds of appeal</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[118]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Mathisen raised several other grounds of appeal, which we did not call on
    the Crown to address.  I will deal with them briefly.</p>
  <h3>(a)       Necessity</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[119]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, defence counsel asked the trial judge to leave the defence of necessity
    with the jury.  The trial judge refused to do so.  He held that this defence
    had no air of reality.  Mr. Mathisen submits that the trial judge erred in
    law in failing to leave necessity with the jury.  We disagree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[120]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defence of necessity applies to a very narrow set of circumstances.  It requires
    the presence of three elements: imminent peril; the absence of any reasonable
    legal alternative; and, proportionality between the harm inflicted and the
    harm avoided: see <i>R. v. Latimer</i>, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 3.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[121]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge concluded that none of these elements had an air of reality.  The
    peril from the attempted poisoning and even from the fire was not imminent:
    it was not “on the verge of transpiring and virtually certain to occur”.  Mr.
    Mathisen could have availed himself of several reasonable legal alternatives:
    he could have called 9-1-1, sought medical assistance, or sought the assistance
    of the police to obtain information from his wife.  And, in the light of
    the evidence the poison had not acted on Mr. Mathisen, causing his wife’s
    death was not a proportionate response.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[122]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    we see no error in the trial judge’s reasons for refusing to leave the defence
    of necessity with the jury.</p>
  <h3><span>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr.
    Rosenbloom and carbon monoxide poising</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[123]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defence argued that Mr. Mathisen’s actions had to be assessed in the light
    of his mental state.  His mental state was affected by sleep deprivation,
    possibly by the ingestion of a poison, and, importantly for this ground of
    appeal, by the inhalation of smoke and carbon monoxide from the fire.  The
    defence sought to qualify Dr. Rosenbloom, a licensed pharmacist, to give
    expert opinion evidence on “the general effects of carbon monoxide poisoning,
    both physical and cognitive.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[124]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown did not oppose the defence’s request that Dr. Rosenbloom give evidence
    of the physical effects of carbon monoxide poisoning.  These effects were
    well established in the literature, and a Crown forensic toxicologist had
    already testified to these effects.  The trial judge ruled that Dr. Rosenbloom
    would be permitted to give opinion evidence on the physical effects of carbon
    monoxide poisoning and on the effects of Mr. Mathisen’s blood pressure medication,
    but not on the neuropsychiatric or cognitive effects of carbon monoxide poisoning.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[125]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Mathisen submits that the trial judge erred in refusing to permit Dr. Rosenbloom
    to give opinion evidence on carbon monoxide’s cognitive effects or on whether
    Mr. Mathisen suffered from any of these effects when he caused his wife’s
    death.  Again, we disagree.  The trial judge correctly ruled that Dr. Rosenbloom
    was not a qualified expert on the subject of the cognitive effects of carbon
    monoxide poisoning.  He properly noted:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr.
    Rosenbloom is a pharmacist, trained in the clinical use of drugs on patients;
    he holds no degrees in medicine, psychiatry, psychology or toxicology;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Carbon
    monoxide is not a drug; the subject of carbon monoxide poisoning falls within
    the discipline of forensic toxicology;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr.
    Rosenbloom’s curriculum vitae lists no published articles on the effects
    of carbon monoxide;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr.
    Rosenbloom has no formal training in carbon monoxide poisoning, and has not
    conducted any research in the area;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although
    Dr. Rosenbloom has participated in the treatment of five to ten persons suffering
    from carbon monoxide poisoning, he has always done so as a member of a treatment
    team with other professionals, including doctors.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[126]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Mathisen contends that Dr. Rosenbloom was qualified because he had extensively
    reviewed the medical literature on the effects of carbon monoxide poisoning.  However,
    we agree with the trial judge that this alone did not qualify Dr. Rosenbloom
    to give an expert opinion outside the area of his field of expertise:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my opinion, it is inappropriate to find a witness
    to be a properly qualified expert where the source of the proposed expertise
    comes from reviewing literature – albeit with a facility that most of us
    would not have – but in respect of a subject matter that is outside the field
    of that witnesses’ (sic) education and training.  In particular, the bulk
    of the opinion letter deals with neuropsychiatric problems attributed to
    carbon monoxide and purports to qualify or bolster as being reasonable the
    reports made by Mr. Mathisen to this witness in respect of neurological or
    behavioural aspects, which in my opinion, are not within Dr. Rosenbloom’s
    sphere of expertise in the ordinary sense.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[127]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Indeed,
    as the Crown points out, were it otherwise, courts would be obliged to qualify
    as experts persons who could not offer real opinions of their own on any
    given subject but could only point to what they had read.  </p>
  <h3>(c)       The Crown’s closing</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[128]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Mathisen submits that the Crown’s closing address to the jury was improper
    because he made several suggestions unsupported by the evidence.  For example,
    the Crown suggested to the jury that Mr. Mathisen deliberately set the fire
    in the kitchen in an attempt to commit suicide.  Mr. Mathisen claimed that
    there was no evidence to support this suggestion.  Overall, according to
    Mr. Mathisen, these unsupported suggestions were prejudicial and contributed
    to his unfair trial.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[129]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not accede to this submission.  We see nothing improper in the Crown’s
    closing.  In our view, the impugned suggestions of the Crown were reasonable
    inferences from the evidence.  Thus, the Crown was entitled to ask the jury
    to draw the inference that Mr. Mathisen had deliberately set the fire.  Notably,
    defence counsel did not object to the Crown’s closing.</p>
  <h3>(d)       The trial judge’s instruction on recklessness</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[130]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Mathisen submits that the trial judge erred in his charge to the jury on
    the recklessness component of the intent for murder under s. 229(a)(ii) of
    the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  The trial judge’s charge contained this instruction:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The crime of murder requires proof of a particular
    state of mind.  For an unlawful killing to be murder, Crown counsel must
    prove that Mr. Mathisen meant either to kill Mrs. Mathisen or meant to cause
    her bodily harm that Mr. Mathisen knew was likely to kill her, and was reckless
    whether she died or not – that is, that he saw the likelihood that she could
    die from the injury, but went ahead anyway and took the chance.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[131]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Mathisen contends this instruction was wrong because it allowed for the possibility
    that he could be convicted of murder if he thought his wife could die from
    her injuries.  Instead, the trial judge should have told the jury that to
    be guilty of murder under this branch of the <i>Code</i>, a person must foresee
    the likelihood of death, not just the risk of death.  In making this submission,
    Mr. Mathisen relies on the judgment of this court in <i>R. v. Czibulka</i> (2004),
    189 C.C.C. (3d) 199, leave to appeal refused [2004] S.C.C.A. No. 502. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[132]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the trial judge’s instruction was correct.  In <i>Czibulka</i> this
    court held that a charge on the recklessness component of the intent for
    murder is wrong if it refers only to the danger that an accused’s conduct
    could bring about death.  As Mr. Mathisen argued, an accused must foresee
    the likelihood of death, not just the risk.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[133]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the trial judge did instruct the jury that, for Mr. Mathisen to be guilty
    of murder, the Crown had to prove “that he saw the <u>likelihood</u> that
    she could die from the injury” (emphasis added).  Moreover, the trial judge’s
    instruction conformed exactly to <i>Watt’s Manual of Criminal Jury Instructions</i> on
    s. 229(a)(ii) as revised after this court’s decision in <i>Czibulka</i>.  Accordingly,
    this ground of appeal failed.</p>
