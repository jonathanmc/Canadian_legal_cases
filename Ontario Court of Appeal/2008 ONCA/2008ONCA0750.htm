    this appeal from the judgment of Brown J. and a jury, the appellant argues
    that the trial judge erred in his application of the doctrine of abuse of
    process.  The defendant David MacArthur had been convicted of dangerous driving
    causing bodily harm by Duncan J. of the Ontario Court of Justice.  In a civil
    action against MacArthur and others, the trial judge ruled that the conviction
    was conclusive of MacArthur’s negligence.  He also ruled that four facts
    that were essential to the conviction were conclusive.  Relying on the abuse
    of process doctrine, the trial judge prohibited MacArthur and the appellant
    from adducing evidence contrary to these essential facts.    </p>

    appellant submits that abuse of process had no application because the appellant
    was not attempting to relitigate MacArthur’s negligence but rather to show
    that the other driver, Ana Dorkin, was also negligent.  Ms. Dorkin’s negligence
    had not been an issue in the criminal proceedings.  The jury in the civil
    trial found MacArthur 100 percent negligent and did not attribute any negligence
    to Ms. Dorkin.  </p>

    July 6, 2001, David MacArthur was driving south on a major highway in the
    City of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Brampton.  He was following two other vehicles that were travelling at a
    high rate of speed.  The plaintiff, Jerry Caci, was a passenger in MacArthur’s
    car.  Ana Dorkin was driving northbound on the highway and was stopped at
    an intersection to make a left turn.  As she made the turn, the three vehicles
    entered the intersection and the MacArthur vehicle struck her vehicle.  Caci
    was seriously injured in the resulting collision.</p>

    a result of the collision, MacArthur was charged with dangerous driving causing
    bodily harm.  He was tried by Duncan J. of the Ontario Court of Justice and
    convicted.  The prosecution called a number of witnesses that had seen MacArthur’s
    driving in the minutes prior to the collision.  It also called an expert
    in accident reconstruction who gave an opinion as to the speed of MacArthur’s
    vehicle at the relevant time.  Duncan J. accepted the evidence of the various
    civilian witnesses who testified to the high rate of speed at which MacArthur
    and the drivers of the other two vehicles were travelling.  He also accepted
    evidence that these vehicles “came out of nowhere” an instant before the
    collision as Ms. Dorkin was making her turn.  While Duncan J. could not quantify
    the speed of the MacArthur vehicle just prior to the collision, he was satisfied
    that MacArthur was travelling very fast and greatly in excess of the speed
    of the other traffic on the highway.  Duncan J. rejected MacArthur’s evidence
    that he was travelling at a normal rate of speed and not racing or pursuing
    the two other vehicles.</p>

    a result of the accident, the plaintiff Jerry Caci and members of his family
    sued MacArthur and others, including Ms. Dorkin and the appellant Economical
    Mutual Insurance Company.  At the time of the accident MacArthur was uninsured.  Caci
    had uninsured and underinsured coverage under a policy of insurance issued
    by the appellant.  At the ensuing jury trial, MacArthur was unrepresented,
    but given the commonality of interests between MacArthur and the appellant,
    counsel for the appellant essentially put in the case that MacArthur would
    have put forward.  The only issue at the civil trial was whether MacArthur
    and Dorkin were both negligent.</p>

    jury selection, counsel for Dorkin brought a motion to be permitted to prove
    MacArthur’s conviction for dangerous driving, as well as certain reasons
    of Duncan J. that explained the conviction.  The trial judge granted the
    motion.  He held that counsel for Dorkin could prove the conviction in accordance
    with ss. 22 and 22.1 of the <i>Evidence Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. E.23.  He
    also held, relying on the abuse of process doctrine as explained in the decision
    of the Supreme Court of Canada in

    <i>Toronto</i><i> (City) v. C.U.P.E., Local 79</i>,<i> </i>[2003] 3 S.C.R.
    77, that neither MacArthur nor the appellant could relitigate the facts essential
    to the conviction.  Finally, he held that counsel for Dorkin could place
    before the jury the facts essential to the conviction, which he summarized
    as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(a)       Three
    vehicles, including Mr. MacArthur's, approached the intersection from the
    north &quot;traveling greatly in excess of the posted speed&quot; and &quot;greatly
    in excess of the speed of other traffic on the road&quot;;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(b)       Mr.
    MacArthur's car was &quot;very close to and following the second car&quot;;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(c)       Two
    of the cars were racing and Mr. MacArthur &quot;was either racing with the
    other vehicles, or was in pursuit of the other vehicles&quot;;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(d)       Because
    all three cars, including Mr. MacArthur's, &quot;were traveling at very excessive
    speeds&quot;, Mr. MacArthur's car, and the other two cars, &quot;had not
    been close to the intersection when [Mrs. Dorkin's] turn began, but were
    there before it could be completed&quot;.</p>

    appellant does not quarrel with the trial judge’s decision admitting MacArthur’s
    conviction for dangerous driving causing bodily harm.  It submits, however,
    that the trial judge erred in his application of the abuse of process doctrine.  It
    relies upon the decision of the Divisional Court in <i>Taylor v. Baribeau</i> (1985),
    51 O.R. (2d) 541, where it was held that a criminal conviction is only <i>prima
    facie</i> proof of the defendant’s negligence, that the findings of fact
    in support of a conviction are not admissible as evidence in the related
    civil proceedings, and that the doctrine of abuse of process has no application

    the appellant submits that the abuse of process doctrine had no application
    because the appellant was not attempting to relitigate MacArthur’s negligence
    but rather show that Dorkin was also negligent, a theory not at issue in
    MacArthur’s criminal trial.  It submits that the effect of the trial judge’s
    ruling was to preclude it and MacArthur from adducing evidence of speed of
    the MacArthur and Dorkin vehicles that would have demonstrated that Dorkin
    was at least partially responsible for the accident.  </p>

    the appellant, relying upon <i>Taylor</i> and this court’s decision in <i>Franco
    v. White</i> (2001), 53 O.R. (3d) 391, submits that where, as here, a party
    attempts to use proof of a prior conviction for offensive purposes to establish
    liability it is only <i>prima facie </i>proof of negligence.  It submits
    that it is only where the conviction is used defensively to resist a claim
    by a convicted party that relitigation is precluded.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    can deal briefly with the decision in
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Taylor</i>. 
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Taylor</i> was decided before the decision in <i>C.U.P.E.</i>, where the
    court clarified and explained the application of the doctrine of abuse of
    process.  To the extent that <i>Taylor</i> holds that the criminal conviction
    is only <i>prima facie</i> proof of negligence and that the findings of fact
    in support of the conviction are never admissible, it has been overtaken
    by <i>C.U.P.E.</i> and decisions of this court, especially <i>Hanna v. Abbott</i> (2006),
    272 D.L.R. (4th) 621.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    am also of the view that the distinction drawn between offensive and defensive
    uses of the prior criminal conviction is inconsistent with <i>C.U.P.E.  </i>Whether
    or not the person convicted may be precluded by the doctrine of abuse of
    process from contesting the underlying facts will depend on the application
    of the principles set out in <i>C.U.P.E.</i> and not simply upon whether
    the use is characterized as offensive or defensive.  I note that this court
    in <i>Franco</i>, while referring to the line of authority that had drawn
    such a distinction, held at para. 31 that it was unnecessary to consider
    whether the abuse of process doctrine “should be extended beyond its apparent
    present limits”.  As a result of <i>C.U.P.E.</i>, the law of abuse of process
    has been explained and extended beyond the limits referred to in <i>Franco</i>.  In
    particular, in <i>C.U.P.E.</i>, Arbour J. speaking for the court at para.
    47 held that there is “no reason to constrain the doctrine of abuse of process
    only to those cases where the plaintiff has initiated the relitigation”
    (i.e. the defensive use of the doctrine).  Also see the discussion of this
    issue at para. 49 of the <i>C.U.P.E.</i> decision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    explained in <i>C.U.P.E.</i>, the abuse of process doctrine engages the court’s
    inherent power to prevent the administration of justice from being brought
    into disrepute.  In the context of a case such as this where the court must
    consider the evidentiary effect of a prior conviction, the issue is “whether
    relitigation would be detrimental to the adjudicative process”: <i>C.U.P.E.</i>, at
    para. 45.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the trial judge properly applied the principles from <i>C.U.P.E.</i> in
    holding that the verdict in the criminal case and the findings essential
    to that verdict were conclusive in the civil proceedings.  To permit MacArthur
    or the appellant, whose interest was identical to MacArthur, to relitigate
    the issue of negligence and the findings essential to that verdict would
    undermine the integrity of the adjudicative process.  MacArthur had been
    found to have committed dangerous driving, an offence of negligence at least
    as high if not higher than civil negligence.  Further, that negligence had
    been proved to the criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.  Finally,
    MacArthur had a full opportunity to defend the allegation of negligence in
    circumstances where he had every reason to mount a complete defence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Arbour
    J. identified several factors at paras. 52 and 53 of the <i>C.U.P.E.</i> decision
    where the abuse of process doctrine should not be applied, including where
    the earlier proceeding was tainted by fraud; where fresh, new evidence previously
    unavailable conclusively impeaches the earlier verdict; or when fairness
    dictates that the first result should not be binding in the subsequent proceedings.  None
    of those factors applied in this case.  It would have been a clear abuse
    of process to allow the appellant and MacArthur to relitigate the issue of
    MacArthur’s negligence and, subject to what I say below about the fourth
    finding, to rebut the judicial findings of fact essential to the conviction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    said, the limits of the application of the abuse of process doctrine were
    reached when it came to the issue of Dorkin’s negligence.  Dorkin’s manner
    of driving was not an issue in the MacArthur criminal trial; that her driving
    might have contributed to the collision did not affect MacArthur’s criminal
    liability.  Permitting the appellant and MacArthur to show that Dorkin was
    partially responsible for the collision was therefore not an abuse of process.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the trial judge’s ruling did not prevent the appellant or MacArthur from
    calling evidence that was relevant to the issue of Dorkin’s negligence, and
    in fact considerable evidence was led on that issue.  Dorkin herself was
    extensively cross-examined as to why she had not seen the three speeding
    vehicles.  The trial judge also fairly placed the issue of Dorkin’s negligence
    before the jury.  In particular, he noted the heavy onus on Dorkin, by virtue
    of s. 141(5) of the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.8, of showing
    that before commencing her left turn she afforded MacArthur a reasonable
    opportunity to avoid a collision.  Several references were made to this onus
    in the main charge and in answer to a question from the jury on this issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s principal complaint is with the trial judge’s holding that no
    evidence could be adduced to rebut the finding by Duncan J. that MacArthur’s
    car and the other two vehicles with which he was either racing or pursuing
    were travelling at “very excessive speeds”.  The appellant submits that this
    finding was not essential to the verdict in the criminal case and undermined
    its attempt to show that Dorkin’s own negligence contributed to the collision.  I
    do not agree.  Excessive speed was essential to the finding of dangerous
    driving.  The trial judge’s ruling did not prevent the appellant from adducing
    evidence about speed and indeed a great deal of evidence of speed was placed
    before the jury in relation to the question of Dorkin’s negligence.  The
    various civilian witnesses who had testified at the criminal trial also testified
    at the civil trial to their observations about the speed of the MacArthur
    vehicle and the other two vehicles.  Finally, expert evidence of accident
    reconstruction, including estimates of speed at the time of the collision,
    was placed before the jury.</p>

    have only one concern with the trial judge’s ruling, relating to the fourth
    finding of fact that was placed before the jury.  It will be recalled that
    this fact was as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Because all
    three cars, including Mr. MacArthur's, “were traveling at very excessive
    speeds”, Mr. MacArthur's car, and the other two cars, “had not been close
    to the intersection when [Mrs. Dorkin's] turn began, but were there before
    it could be completed”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    finding not only related to MacArthur’s negligence but might also have been
    seen by the jury as impacting on Dorkin’s negligence.  It would have been
    better if it had not been placed before the jury.  However, the trial judge
    made it clear to the jury that this and the other findings were to be taken
    only as dispositive of MacArthur’s negligence.  Thus, after reciting the
    four findings in the charge to the jury, the trial judge said this:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>As I have said,
    in your deliberations, you must accept those facts regarding the way in which
    Mr. MacArthur drove his car as binding on you.  You cannot come to a different
    conclusion about how Mr. MacArthur drove his car.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge then immediately turned to the issue of Dorkin’s negligence and
    reminded the jury of the “very heavy onus” on a driver making a left-hand
    turn into the path of an approaching vehicle.  In my view, neither the trial
    judge’s ruling nor the charge to the jury undermined the defence position
    that Dorkin was negligent.</p>
