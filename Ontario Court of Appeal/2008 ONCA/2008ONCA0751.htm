'>[1]</span></span></span></a> Robert Cranston, Robert Solleveld, and his wife,
    Desiree Solleveld (the respondents) were charged with 32 counts of fraud
    and conspiracy.  It was the Crown’s theory that the respondents were running
    a “prime bank” or “high yield” investment scam.  In this type of commercial
    fraud, people invest in transactions that purport to provide extremely high
    returns without risk of loss of the principal investment but the transactions
    do not exist. </p>

    copies and information contained therein are subject to the same order prohibiting

    March 10, 2006, following the completion of a 29-day preliminary inquiry,
    the respondents were committed to stand trial on two global counts of fraud. 
    <st1:City w:st="on">

    the trial began, the respondents brought an application pursuant to s. 11(b)
    of the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms </i>for a stay of proceedings
    on the ground that there had been an unreasonable delay in bringing the matter
    to trial.  On August 27, 2007, Harris J. of the Superior Court of Justice
    granted a stay after concluding that the respondents’ right to a trial within
    a reasonable time had been infringed.   </p>

    the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal, set aside the stay of
    proceedings and order that the matter proceed to trial.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>A BRIEF CHRONOLOGY  </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Robert
    and Desiree Solleveld ran an investment club called TCSI Incorporated or
    Club TCSI (“TCSI”).  TCSI purported to provide investors with the opportunity
    to invest in complicated international banking transactions that provided
    extremely high rates of return without any risk of loss of the capital invested.  Despite
    these assurances of guaranteed high rates of return and no risk of loss to
    invested capital, investor after investor testified at the preliminary inquiry
    that neither occurred.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Robert
    Cranston operated a business called Island Holdings or Paradise Holdings.  He
    solicited funds for the same investment purpose as TCSI and gave generally
    the same types of documents and assurances as those given by TCSI.  Again,
    his investors lost most of their investments.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    were two investigations into the investment activities of the Sollevelds.  In
    2000 or 2001, the RCMP in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    London conducted an investigation into the Sollevelds’ activities that resulted
    in no charges being laid.  In 2002, a second investigation was commenced
    by the RCMP in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Hamilton as a result of a complaint about
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Cranston by a dissatisfied investor.  The second investigation led back to
    the Sollevelds and resulted in them being charged, together with
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Cranston, on November 4, 2003.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second investigation was large and complicated.  Disclosure filled over 100
    volumes of bound documents.  Scott McBride, a forensic accountant retained
    by the RCMP in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Hamilton to assist with the investigation, spent 1100 hours reviewing the
    documents that had been seized from the respondents and their banks, and
    preparing a lengthy multi-volume report.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents were released on bail on November 19, 2003.  The bail conditions
    required the respondents to: remain in Ontario; not enter onto airport grounds;
    report weekly to the local RCMP detachment; not solicit or conduct transactions
    or business as a financial planner or investment counsellor whether remunerated
    or not; not offer or give financial advice, whether that advice was solicited
    or not; and not dispose of or dissipate any business assets or real or personal
    property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the request of the Sollevelds, there were numerous adjournments or delays
    between November 19, 2004, and mid-February 2005.  The adjournments were
    sought because of Mr. Solleveld’s expectation that he would receive funds
    that could be used to pay legal expenses and make restitution, and thereby
    possibly resolve matters.  No one seriously challenged the requested adjournments
    as everyone had the legitimate hope that Mr. Solleveld would, indeed, come
    into funds.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    February 15, 2005, the parties set a trial date of August 16, 2005, in provincial
    court.  </p>

    from the record in June 2005. </p>

    July 4, 2005, the Sollevelds re-elected trial by judge and jury, with the
    then-existing trial dates to be used for a preliminary inquiry.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    preliminary inquiry took place over 29 days between August 16, 2005, and
    December 1, 2005.  There were 23 days of evidence, 1 day lost due to the
    absence of a translator and 5 days of submissions.  The Crown served 120
    subpoenas in preparation for the preliminary hearing.  The Crown ended up
    calling 21 witnesses and filing 254 exhibits.  Exhibit 2 was Scott McBride’s
    report; it took up several binders.   </p>

    on July 9, 2007.  The trial was subsequently rescheduled to begin on September
    10, 2007, with an anticipated completion date of April 10, 2008.  Before
    trial began, the respondents brought a stay application.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE REASONS FOR STAYING THE

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a> the trial judge recognised that there were five
    factors to be considered when deciding the stay application: (1) the length
    of the delay; (2) waiver of time periods; (3) the reasons for the delay,
    including limits on institutional resources and the inherent time requirements
    of the case; (4) prejudice to the accused; and (5) balancing of the problems
    that the delay caused for the respondents against the public interest in
    seeing that the criminal charges are properly disposed of.   </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span
lang=EN-US>Length of Delay</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that the period between the laying of the charges and the
    anticipated culmination of the six-month trial was approximately four years
    and five months (53 months).  Given the length of the delay, he found that
    it was appropriate to consider whether the respondents’ 11(b) rights had
    been infringed.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US>Waiver</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that none of the respondents waived their 11(b) rights
    during the proceedings.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span
lang=EN-US>Reasons for the Delay</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge attributed the delays as follows: to the Crown -- 281 days, institutional
    delay of 668 days, defence-caused delay of 106 days, and inherent delay of
    368 days.  He viewed the Crown and institutional delay together as having
    caused a total delay of 949 days or 31.5 months.  In his reasons, the trial
    judge offers some general comments about each type of delay but he made no
    attempt to analyse the various time periods nor did he explain why he allocated
    the delay as he did.        </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that prejudice could be inferred from the length of the
    delay following arrest.  He stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This case is now four years old and that length
    of time breeds failing memories, relocated witnesses, which in turn impacts
    on trial fairness. Failing memories also includes those memories of the accused
    innocence and making it more difficult to instruct their counsel and/or defend
    their cause. This cannot be underestimated, even though there will be documentation
    to assist the witnesses, time [takes] its toll on all of us, and in this
    case, four years later and seven years after the events in question is a
    serious impediment to the accused.       </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge concluded that the respondents also suffered actual prejudice.  At
    pp. 10 and 11 of the reasons, he stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In terms of actual prejudice, I would characterize
    the bail terms as restrictive and included, in effect, the closing down of
    the accused businesses, pending the completion of the trial, and as well,
    a prohibition against the taking of any employment in matters involving any
    sort of financial planning or banking. Seeking employment would be almost
    impossible for persons the age of the accused, and with criminal charges
    pending against them, it is easy to imagine that any attempts at obtaining
    employment in the short run would require an explanation to the prospective
    employer for their unemployment predicament. They would have to alert their
    prospective employer that they had been charged under the <i>Criminal Code</i>,
    with fraud.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Anytime the state places strict bail restrictions
    on a citizen, it ought to be accompanied with an assiduous devotion to a
    timely trial. Surely the bail restrictions could have been worked through
    with counsel right from the start to ameliorate the loss of employment, given
    the need for legal representation and groceries.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    reasons of the trial judge with respect to balancing are extremely brief.  Under
    the heading
    “balancing”, the trial judge did nothing more than note that the societal
    interest in having charges tried increases with the seriousness of the charges.  Arguably,
    however, balancing is also addressed in a later paragraph contained in the
    section in the reasons entitled
    “conclusion” (the “Paragraph”).  The full text of the Paragraph reads as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>At the end of the day, the amount of the delay,
    the reasons for the delay and the presence of prejudice to the accused arising
    from that delay, satisfies me that the interests of a timely trial outweigh
    the societal interest [in] having these charges tried.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pursuant
    to s. 11(b) of the <i>Charter</i>, an accused person has the right to be
    brought to trial within a reasonable time.  It is the accused’s onus to establish
    a violation of his or her s. 11(b) right.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    overarching issue in this case is whether the trial judge erred in finding
    an unreasonable delay and, consequently, ordering a stay of the proceedings.  The
    Crown concedes that the length of the delay warrants inquiry and that there
    had been no constitutional waiver of the delay.  Thus, the specific issues
    for determination are whether the trial judge erred in his: (1) allocation
    of the delay, (2) findings of prejudice to the respondents, or (3) balancing
    of the rights of the accused against the societal interests in having those
    accused of crimes dealt with fairly.    </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    will be recalled that the trial judge stated that the Crown and institutional
    delay accounted for 949 days of delay.  It will be further recalled that
    the trial judge did not explain how he arrived at his allocation of delay.  Instead,
    he made some general statements about the conduct of the parties and, occasionally,
    described a specific aspect of the proceedings and how he would treat the
    time.  One example of the latter will suffice.  In respect of intake, he
    allowed six months of time, explaining that a four-year investigation preceded
    the laying of charges so the intake period should have been shorter.  He
    does not explain the date or event that he views to be the end of the intake
    period nor does he explain why he chose six months as the appropriate amount
    of time for intake purposes.  He simply says that given the four-year investigation
    leading up to the laying of the charges, in his view, six months is an appropriate
    intake period.  Further and in any event, he is in error in respect of the
    duration of the investigation.  The trial judge appears to have confused
    two different investigations.  The investigation that underlay the charges
    in question lasted for a period of one and a half years, not four years. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    allocating delay, it is important that the trial judge give sufficient reasons
    that the parties and the reviewing court can understand the time that was
    allocated and the reasons therefor.  In the present case, the trial judge
    did not attempt to go through the time periods nor did he explain how he
    arrived at his allocation of the delay.  Consequently, the reasons do not
    admit of appropriate appellate review.        </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown submits that the trial judge failed to properly allocate delay primarily
    because he did not properly allow for the time requirements of a complicated
    fraud involving multiple accused.  I agree.  The five errors made in respect
    of the time allocations relate to the following:  the intake period in the

    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Provincial Court; defence-requested adjournments; the preliminary inquiry

    to these errors, it is useful to recall the principles which inform this
    area of the law.</p>

    stay imposed for a violation of s. 11(b) is to be reviewed on a standard
    of correctness.  No deference need be accorded the trial judge’s attribution
    of the various periods of delay, or his or her ultimate conclusion as to
    the reasonableness of the delay:  see <i>R. v. M. (N.N.)</i> (2006), 209

    scope of institutional delay, the Supreme Court in <i>Morin</i> set out the
    following guidelines:  eight to ten months in the Ontario Court of Justice
    and six to eight months in the Superior Court of Justice.  These are not
    limitation periods.  Rather, they are factors to be weighed in the overall
    assessment of the reasonableness of the total delay:  see <i>R. v. Allen</i> (1996),
    110 C.C.C. (3d) 331 (Ont.

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Institutional
    delay must be contrasted with the inherent time requirements of a case.  The
    latter concept generally encompasses the time taken at both levels of court
    to get the case to the point where the parties are ready to set trial dates.  It
    includes the time needed to retain and instruct counsel, conduct bail hearings,
    undertake administration and paperwork, and comply with disclosure obligations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    the more complicated the case, the greater the inherent time requirements
    will be.  This case is a complex fraud which involves trying multiple individuals.  Both
    these factors have been recognised as increasing inherent time requirements:  see <i>R.
    v. Horgan</i> (2007), 165 C.R.R. (2d) 332 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), at para. 38.  Complex fraud cases typically require substantial preparation
    time and court time, as a result of having to review large quantities of
    complicated financial documents, and interview many witnesses, including
    experts.  Trying multiple individuals may significantly extend the time reasonably
    required to complete the proceedings as there is the need to co-ordinate
    the schedules of multiple counsel for intake matters, the preliminary hearing
    and the trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    factors were present in this case.  This was a complex investment fraud involving
    a massive amount of disclosure, over 100 potential witnesses, and numerous
    co-accused.  It was scheduled for a six-month jury trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In

    trial judge then used this erroneous view of the pre-charge delay to assess
    the reasonableness of the post-charge delay.  First, he found that given
    the supposed four-year “head start”, a six-month period of neutral time up
    to May 4, 2004, was appropriate.  Then, in assessing the reasonableness of
    delay relating to Crown disclosure, he found that “[t]<span

    as a result of new disclosure and was rescheduled for September 8, 2004,
    and again to September 13, 2004.  As a result, I attribute 49 days of the

    bail hearings were being co-ordinated, counsel were being retained, and the
    Crown was producing disclosure and defence counsel were reviewing it.  In
    addition, there were minor delays caused by the then co-accused, Mr. Ahmad

    this court has recognised that the delay needed to schedule a judicial pre-trial
    is properly considered institutional delay, the time the parties require
    to prepare for and conduct the pre-trial may be an inherent time requirement:  see <i>R.
    v. M. (N.N.)</i> at para. 33.  Further, during this period, there were other
    activities taking place such as additional bail proceedings, consent releases
    and continuing Crown disclosure.  In light of both the need for preparation

    scheduled on August 17, 2006.  Accordingly, the Crown asked to begin the
    case at the beginning of July 2007.  The trial judge found that the 109 days
    between September 15, 2006, and January 2, 2007, was institutional, and the
    further six-month delay between January and July was Crown delay.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span

    delay as it fails to adequately take into account the nature of the case,
    the circumstances that gave rise to the conflict causing the delay, and the
    relevant jurisprudence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, this six-month period (188 days) should be treated as inherent delay.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    neither of the respondents opposed a July trial date.  Counsel for
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Cranston made no complaint or assertion that he wanted an earlier trial.  He
    stated,
    “I’m available for that, Your Honour.  I’m also available earlier in the
    Year.”  The Sollevelds similarly expressed no concern about the date.  In
    fact, Robert Solleveld stated, “We prefer July as well, Your Honour.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    as noted previously, this was a complex fraud case involving a massive amount
    of evidence.  Given the amount of work already conducted, including the conduct
    of the 29-day preliminary inquiry and the volume and complexity of material
    deciphered by Crown counsel, it would not be reasonable to expect a new Crown
    counsel to take over the matter and get up to speed on the file in time for
    the July trial dates.  The view of the trial judge is at odds with the practical
    reality, recognised in <i>Morin</i> at p. 792, that “counsel for the prosecution
    and the defence cannot be expected to devote their time exclusively to one
    case.”  This position was adopted by this court in <i>R. v. G. (C.R.)</i> at
    para. 24, and <i>R. v. Allen</i> at p. 348.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further
    and importantly, the conflicting dates of the homicide trial had been chosen
    on August 17, during one of the adjournment periods requested by the Sollevelds
    to retain counsel.</p>

    period from the charges being laid (November 4, 2003) to the commencement
    of trial (September 10, 2007) was 46 months.  The trial judge attributed

    already given, he erred.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I have explained, approximately 31 months (929 days) of the delay should
    be treated as inherent or defence-caused delay which leaves the remaining
    15 months as institutional and Crown delay.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
    constitutes an acceptable period of systemic or institutional delay will
    vary depending on the nature and circumstances of each case.  After allowing
    for a reasonable neutral intake period, the permissible range for systemic
    delay is between 14 and 18 months for matters in the Superior Court of Justice.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

    a trial date and are responsible for significant periods of the delay. 
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Cranston, while purporting to want an early trial, took no steps to push
    for an early trial.  Furthermore, much of the evidence in this case is documentary,
    thus the concern with failing memories is much diminished.  While the trial
    judge alluded to the fact there was documentation, he failed to recognise
    or consider its significance in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    any event, the trial judge erred in finding actual prejudice.  It will be
    recalled that he found that the respondents suffered actual prejudice because
    restrictive bail conditions led to their businesses being closed down and
    precluded them from finding employment.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In

    of the bail conditions.

    Cranston voluntarily stopped his business in December 2000 – years before
    the charges in question were laid -- in order to comply with a cease-trade
    order issued by the Ontario Securities Commission (“OSC”).  Further, on December
    12, 2000, the OSC issued a statement of allegations relating to

    Sollevelds’ business also evaporated before the charges were laid.  A letter
    dated February 24, 2004, written by Robert Solleveld and sent to investors,
    was tendered on the 11(b) application (the “Letter”).  In the Letter, Robert
    Solleveld stated that in May 2001, he closed his business office and laid
    off most employees.  It will be recalled that the charges against the Sollevelds
    were laid on November 4, 2003.  The Letter also describes events in 2003,
    before the charges were laid, as being “complete hell” during which time
    the Sollevelds were “selling off as many assets as possible to meet the legal
    and other obligations.”  Further, Donna McNicholl, a former TCSI employee,
    testified at the preliminary hearing that TCSI was evicted from its premises
    in mid to late April 2001 for failing to pay rent.      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    for the suggestion that the Sollevelds suffered financial problems as a result
    of delay, again the record does not support such a finding.  The Sollevelds
    approached the Crown for a bail variation to further mortgage their home,
    months after they had already lost the home through a power of sale and only
    days before their possessions were going to auction.  In any event, there
    was no equity left in the home to mortgage.  And, despite the bail condition
    prohibiting the Sollevelds from disposing of or dissipating any real or personal
    property, they put large additional mortgages on their home not long after
    being released on bail.  While Mr. Solleveld acknowledged receiving the mortgage
    money, it is unclear what happened to those funds.  </p>

    Cranston’s inability to find employment was significantly impacted by separate

    unable to find employment as a result of the bail conditions.  The record
    suggests that any inability to find employment arose either from events that
    predate the charges or as a result of the charges themselves.  Of the events
    that predate the charges, I make note of only two.  First, there is Robert
    Solleveld’s prior bankruptcy.  Second, in the Letter, Robert Solleveld states
    that he pleaded guilty in October 2002 to assisting people in tax evasions
    and paid a fine of $133,000 rather than going to jail.    </p>

    the circumstances, the trial judge erred in finding that the prejudice flowed
    from the delay.  As prejudice is not inferred and was not otherwise proven,
    the basis for enforcement of the individual right protected by s. 11(b) was “seriously
    undermined”.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8"

    that part of the reasons entitled “balancing”, the trial judge correctly
    stated that there is a societal interest in seeing that criminal charges
    are properly disposed of and that this interest is to be balanced against
    the prejudice caused to the respondents by the delay.  However, he makes
    no attempt to undertake such a balancing.   </p>

    if it is assumed that the Paragraph is meant to amount to a balancing, it
    fails as it is simply conclusory.  It contains no analysis or reasoning.  The
    Paragraph amounts to no more than saying that delay plus prejudice outweighs
    the societal interest in seeing that the charges are properly disposed of.  In
    contrast to the consideration shown for prejudice to the respondents flowing
    from the delay, no mention is made of the seriousness of the charges and
    the harm that the investors had suffered.     </p>

    properly taken into account, together with the inherent time requirements
    in a case such as this, the minimal prejudice suffered by the respondents
    and the seriousness of the charges, the delay is not unreasonable.  Certainly,
