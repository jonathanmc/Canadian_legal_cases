  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    2002, this court quashed a bylaw enacted by the Town of Oakville prohibiting
    the erection of third p arty signs (signs that direct attention to products,
    goods or services not located on the same premises as the signs) on the basis
    that the prohibition violated s.&nbsp;2(b) of the <i>Charter</i> <i>of Rights
    and Freedoms </i>and could not be saved under s. 1. While recognizing the
    Town’s legitimate objectives for enacting the bylaw, the court found that
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Oakville had several “unremarkable industrial zones” such that a total prohibition
    on third party signs could not be reasonably and demonstrably justified under
    s. 1 of the <i>Charter</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      Town subsequently adopted a new bylaw that allowed third party billboards
      but imposed restrictions as to where billboard signs could be erected.
      The respondent successfully challenged the constitutionality of this new
      bylaw in the court below. The application judge found that the restrictions
      imposed by the bylaw amounted to an effective prohibition on billboards
      which could not be justified under s. 1. He quashed the bylaw in its entirety
      subject to a suspension of the quashing for six months. In addition, he
      ordered the Town to grant permits to the respondent for certain billboards
      it had applied to erect in the Town’s heavy industrial zones. The order
      permitted the billboards to be erected without having to comply with the
      provisions of the bylaw. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      Town appeals both the finding that the bylaw cannot be saved under s. 1
      of the <i>Charter</i> as well as the remedy granted by the application
      judge. For the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal as to remedy
      and on the s. 1 issue in part. I would substitute the judgment below with
      an order quashing ss. 39(1), (3), (4) and (5)(b) of Bylaw 2006-005, subject
      to a suspension of that order for a period of six months.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>PROCEDURAL BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    1994, the Town of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Oakville enacted a sign bylaw that prohibited all billboard signs larger
    than 80 square feet as well as the erection of third party signs.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the year 2000, Vann Niagara Ltd., a predecessor corporation of the respondent,
    filed applications with respect to 52 locations (86 signs) for the erection
    of billboards. These were denied. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent challenged the constitutionality of the bylaw. In 2002, a majority
    of this court declared that both the size restriction provision and the third
    party sign provision violated the right to freedom of expression under s.
    2(b) of the <i>Charter </i>and could not be saved under s. 1: <i>Vann Niagara
    Ltd. v. Oakville (Town) </i>(2002), 60 O.R. (3d) 1 (“<i>Vann No. 1</i>”).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Borins
    J.A., with whom Feldman J.A. concurred, held that that the entire bylaw could
    not be saved under s. 1. The Town failed to demonstrate that the prohibitions
    on signs over 80 square feet as well as third party signs were rationally
    connected to the Town’s stated objectives. In particular, there were several “unremarkable
    industrial zones” in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Oakville and the prohibition on third party signs was not rationally connected
    to the legitimate objective of preserving the aesthetic character of the
    Town. Moreover, he held that the bylaw, as a total prohibition on a form
    of expression, did not minimally impair the s. 2(b) right. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>MacPherson
    J.A. dissented but only with respect to the size restriction provision. In
    his view, although this provision violated s.&nbsp;2(b) of the <i>Charter</i>,
    it was reasonably and demonstrably justified pursuant to s. 1. Based on his
    interpretation of the bylaw, the size restriction and third party ban provisions
    were separate and unrelated. In his view, once it was accepted that some
    form of size restriction was appropriate, courts should be deferential about
    the actual line chosen by municipalities.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Town sought leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada on the size restriction
    issue only. The Supreme Court of Canada allowed the appeal and adopted the
    reasons of MacPherson J.A.: <i>Vann Niagara Ltd. v.
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Oakville (Town)</i>,<i> </i>[2003] 3 S.C.R. 158. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision, the Town of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Oakville undertook a review process in order to prepare a new sign bylaw.
    The Town organized a working group to study the matter and make recommendations
    to Town Council. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One
    of the key issues for the working group was determining the appropriate locations
    for third party signs. One of the group’s guiding principles was to limit
    additional structures in the streetscape. At the time of the review process,
    only one third party sign existed in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Oakville. It was protected by a grandfathering provision. The virtual absence
    of third party signs was considered to be important to the Town as it contributed
    to the distinct visual character and aesthetic of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Oakville.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Town engaged in a public consultation process and invited submissions from
    the sign industry. As part of the consultation process, a consultation paper
    was prepared. The paper presented various objectives to guide the location
    of signs having regard to the Town’s existing character. These objectives
    included the following:</p>
  <p>(a)       additional structures in the streetscape should be minimized;</p>
  <p>(b)       advertising signs should not be located in residential areas and
    should be located at a sufficient distance away from residential areas so
    that they are not visible from residential areas or do not impact on their
    character; and</p>
  <p>(c)       advertising signs should not be located at the major entry points
    to the Town or within areas that act as gateways to the Town.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Town clerk wrote to the respondent directly to ensure that it had notice
    of public meetings being held by the working group and a copy of the consultation
    paper. The respondent did not participate in the meetings. Its president
    wrote back to the Town, saying, in effect, that it should be allowed to erect
    signs in the 52 “non-descript” locations for which it had made applications
    back in 2000. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    the consultation process, the working group’s final report and a draft bylaw
    were submitted to Town Council. The report recommended that advertising signs
    should be specifically defined and should be permitted only on vacant lots
    with no other signs on the lot; only in E2 employment zones south of Dundas
    Street; and subject to a number of specific setback restrictions and other
    regulatory requirements.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Bylaw
    2005-036 implementing these recommendations was passed by the Town Council
    on March 8, 2005. This bylaw was replaced by the current sign bylaw, Bylaw
    2006-005, which is the same in all relevant aspects. Section 1 of the bylaw
    defines an “advertising sign” as a “sign which is owned and maintained by
    a person engaged in the rental or leasing of the sign face area for advertising
    goods services or facilities”. Section 39 places restrictions on the location
    of advertising signs: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>39.      No person shall erect, locate or display
    an advertising sign:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(1)    if any other sign is also erected, located,
    or displayed on the property, other than a temporary real estate sign with
    a sign area of no greater than 4.65 m<sup>2</sup> (50 sq. ft.) and a maximum
  height of 3.6 metres (11.8 ft) or an election sign;</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(2)    on any property North of Dundas Street;</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(3)    on property other than property within
    an E2 Zone under the Zoning By-law;</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(4)    if there is any building on the property,
    or a building permit has been issued for a building on the property;</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(5)    within 200 metres of any of the following:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a) any property within a residential zone
    or legally used for residential purposes;</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(b) the road allowance of any of the following
    streets: Burloak Drive, Bronte Road (Regional Road <span
style='font-size:12.5pt;font-family:Arial;'>25), </span>Third Line, Fourth Line,
    Nottinghill Gate, Dorval Drive, Kerr Street, Trafalgar Road, Ford Drive,
    and Winston Churchill Boulevard; or</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(c) the QEW and Highway 403 corridors; and</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(6)    any closer to the edge of the road allowance
    than the set back required for buildings and structures other than signs
    on the property under the provisions of the Zoning By-law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent’s challenge to the bylaw relates to the 52 locations for which
    it sought permits back in 2000. The locations are in what the respondent
    calls the “employment lands” zones of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Oakville which include a mixture of commercial and industrial land uses.
    While some of the 52 locations are within the E2 zone, where the bylaw permits
    the placement of such signs, none of the applications meet the other conditions
    in s. 39. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE DECISION OF THE APPLICATION
      JUDGE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent’s challenge to the new bylaw focussed on ss. 39(1), (3), (4),
    (5)(a), (5)(b) and (6). No issue was taken with ss. 39(2) or (5)(c). The
    respondent argued that in all of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Oakville, there existed only nine locations where signs could be erected
    in compliance with the bylaw and none of these was a site on which the respondent
    had proposed to erect a sign. Further, of the nine available locations, only
    one or two at most had sufficient visibility and traffic to be commercially
    viable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge held that the bylaw constituted a <i>prima facie </i>violation
    of s. 2(b). He then moved on to consider whether the bylaw could be saved
    under s. 1 of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge held that whether or not it was the Town’s intent, the
    result of the bylaw was to effectively ban billboard advertising in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Oakville. While the application judge referred to a general ban on all billboard
    advertising, given the definition of an “advertising sign” above, he may
    be taken to have been referring to third party signs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the view of the application judge, as a result of the bylaw, billboards were
    restricted to pockets within the municipality that were tiny in comparison
    to the total area within its borders. Almost all of the commercial and industrial
    areas within the municipality were eliminated from consideration. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge held that the fact that the Town had engaged in a consultation
    process could not assist it in light of the fact that this court had already
    held that a ban on billboard advertising in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Oakville was constitutionally impermissible in <i>Vann No. 1</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge noted that in <i>Vann No. 1</i>, although this court did
    not undertake an analysis of the different zones in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Oakville, it did describe the various industrial areas in the Town as “unremarkable”.
    The application judge noted at the outset of his reasons that the Town in
    this case had offered no particular rationale for confining billboards to
    the E2 Zones, as opposed to any of the other unremarkable areas in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Oakville.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the end, the application judge found that the Town had failed to show that

      since the messages sought to be conveyed by the respondent are commercial
      and fall outside the core of protected expression and the values underlying

      the sign bylaw falls squarely within its policy discretion and that this

      not involve the property owner’s own right of expression. Other than the
      limited instances where the respondent is using the billboard to advertise
      its own services, the respondent in this case is acting as an intermediary

    signs can in some cases amount to a “serious and unjustified infringement
    of a form of expression that has been commonly used for a long time and <i>is</i> closely

      in the Town’s view, the imposition of the size restriction, which was held

      this would not, in my view, sufficiently alter the impact of the above

      the Town has failed to demonstrate that this is the case. Simply put, it
      is not clear why restrictions which rule out virtually all commercially
      viable sign locations across a diverse range of areas and land uses are

      I would not give effect to the Town’s suggestion that the availability
      of other forms of advertising, and in particular, third party advertising
      in bus shelters, it has provided an adequate outlet for commercial expression
      so as to justify the aforementioned restrictions in the bylaw. The Town
      has led no evidence to indicate that this type of advertising provides
      an equivalent outlet for commercial expression. Nor has it shown that by
      allowing bus shelter advertising and enacting restrictions that effectively
      prohibit viable third party sign locations in areas described by this court
      as “unremarkable industrial zones”, it minimally intruded on the s. 2(b)
      right.</span></p>

      it is not this court’s function to re-legislate the Town’s bylaws, a consideration
      of conceivably less intrusive means to achieve the Town’s objectives serves
      two functions. It both illustrates the Town’s failure to demonstrate that
      the aforementioned provisions, as enacted, minimally impair the s. 2(b)
      right and provides some limited guidance to the Town for drafting future
      bylaws. By way of example, it may be that:</span></p>

      need not make any finding in this regard. Nor should these observations
      be taken to mean that the bylaw, as a whole, must allow a minimum number
      of third party signs. It is sufficient to say that on this record, the
      Town has failed to show that, taken together, ss. 39(1), (3), (4) and (5)(b)
      minimally impair the s. 2(b) right. </span></p>

      reaching this conclusion, I do not wish to be taken to have ignored the
      significance of the Town’s public consultation process. In my view, the
      fact that the Town engaged in this process and the respondent refused to
      participate in it is significant. Consultative processes provide guidance
      to municipal bodies on how to craft bylaws that balance the wishes of the
      various interests in the community. It is this balancing function that
      entitles choices made by legislative bodies such as the Town Council to
      considerable deference. It may well be that, had the respondent participated
      in the consultation, it could have ensured that the Town was made aware
      of its concerns respecting the effect the bylaw would have on commercially
      viable third party sign locations. The respondent may also have been able
      to suggest ways to minimize these effects without compromising the Town’s
      objectives. Given the severity of the impact of ss. 39(1), (3), (4) and
      (5)(b) and the Town’s failure to justify its choice of means, however,
      I do not think that the respondent’s failure to participate, regrettable
      as it is, should disentitle it to <i>Charter </i>relief. </span></p>

    effects on freedom of expression and these provisions pass the requirement
    of proportionality: <i>Dagenais v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp.</i>, [1994]
    3 S.C.R. 835. With respect to s. 39(5)(a), there are other outlets for commercial
    expression in Oakville outside of residential zones and the aesthetic benefit
    to the Town of prohibiting third party signs in residential areas is clear.
    Similarly, in my view, s. 39(6) does not significantly curtail the ability
    to erect third party signs and the benefit of preserving a uniform streetscape
    to the Town is obvious.</p>

    challenge to the bylaw was directed only to some of the restrictions set
    out in s. 39. No issue was taken with any of the other provisions of the
    bylaw which regulate a wide variety of signs in the Town and establish a
    permit regime for signs.</span></p>

      the right should be struck. I would therefore quash ss. 39(1), (3), (4)

      These permits were to be issued regardless of whether the other restrictions

      relief on the ground that this was the respondent’s second successful challenge
      to the Town’s sign bylaw and that the respondent was entitled to meaningful

        power or clearly wrong conduct on the part of the legislature, it is
        generally not appropriate to combine a s. 52(1) remedy with a s. 24(1)

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[t]he purpose of a suspended declaration
      of invalidity can be to facilitate the legislature’s function in crafting
      a prospective remedy. The temporal delay in striking down the law also

      noted by the application judge, the present case is unusual in that this
      is the respondent’s second successful challenge to the Town’s sign bylaw.
      The prior bylaw, however, was somewhat different than the bylaw currently
      in place. Notwithstanding the finding that ss. 39(1), (3), (4) and (5)(b)
      do not minimally impair the s. 2(b) right, it was the Town’s first attempt
      to produce a bylaw aimed at restricting, rather than explicitly prohibiting,
      third party signs.</span></p>

      impact of allowing the respondent’s signs on the legitimate concerns of
      the Town. </span></p>

      it is noteworthy that the application judge clearly underestimated the
      extent of the relief he granted. When he rendered his decision, the application
      judge believed that his order would allow the erection of signs in 11 different
      locations. As it turns out, the decision would allow the erection of signs
      in 21 different locations.</span></p>

      to erect 21 signs without regard to the Town’s legitimate concerns “other
      than being restricted to E2 zones”. In the circumstances, such an order
      is not warranted by the Town’s conduct and would unnecessarily complicate
      the Town’s task of drafting new restrictions that appropriately balance
      its concerns with the freedom of expression rights of members of the billboard
