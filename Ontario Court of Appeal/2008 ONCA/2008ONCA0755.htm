    common law wife.  The indictment alleged
    four counts of sexual exploitation related to the time when the complainant was
    a teenager living with the appellant and her mother.  A fifth count alleged that the appellant
    sexually assaulted the complainant several years later when she was married and
    living with her husband.  The jury found
    the appellant guilty of one count of sexual exploitation, acquitted the
    appellant on another count of sexual exploitation and acquitted the appellant
    of sexual assault.  The jury was unable
    to reach a verdict on two remaining sexual exploitation charges and a mistrial
    was declared in relation to those counts. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Well into deliberations, the jury asked the following
    question:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Is the jury to decide each charge <u>strictly</u> on the evidence presented for that charge? I.E. If, for example, a juror does
    not accept that one of the incidence/charges happened, should that influence
    his/her decision on another charge, or does each charge have to stand on its
    own evidence?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In discussions regarding whether the question concerned
    evidence or credibility, both the appellants counsel and Crown counsel raised
    concerns regarding the possibility that the jury may have been under the
    mistaken impression that they were obliged to compartmentalize their assessment
    of the complainants credibility to the individual counts.  Based on the wording of the question, counsel
    were concerned that the jury may have decided one count in a manner that called
    the complainants credibility into question and that the jury did not know
    whether they could use that credibility assessment in their deliberations
    pertaining to the other counts.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite the concerns of counsel, the trial judge
    decided to restrict his answer to the question of evidence.  The trial judge did so because he was
    concerned that he would add to the jurys confusion if he instructed them at
    the same time not to compartmentalize their credibility findings.  The trial judge explained this to
    counsel:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>He says, A juror.  Maybe this is just a hypothetical juror.  I dont know.  If, for example, a
    juror does not accept that one of the incidents happened, that doesnt necessarily
    mean that the reason was because he believed one story and not the other.  It just means that he doesnt think it
    happened and you cant  credibility, I think, will muddy the waters because
    credibility just goes across the whole field, but it is not responsive to their
    question because they are saying Is the jury to decide each charge strictly on
    the evidence presented for that charge?  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The instruction that the trial judge decided to give to
    the jurys question came from David
    Watt, <i>Watts Manual of Criminal Jury Instructions</i> (Toronto: Thomson Carswell, 2005).  The
    instruction is designed for a jury considering a single accused charged with
    multiple counts relating to different complainants where there is no similar
    fact ruling permitting cross-count use of the evidence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before giving this instruction, the trial judge told
    the jury: We had some difficulty determining whether the way we read your
    question was the way you read it, but I have a charge to read to you that we
    think is responsive to the question.  The trial judge then proceeded to tell the jurors to consider that each
    allegation was a separate charge and that each count must be decided
    separately.  He instructed the jury that,
    You must make your decision on each charge only on the basis of the evidence
    that relates to that charge .  You must
    not use evidence that relates only to one charge in making your decision on any
    other charge.  He concluded by telling
    the jury that if they had any further questions arising from the answer, he
    would deal with them the following morning when the jury resumed its
    deliberations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the trial judges answer correctly recited the
    law on cross-count use of evidence, we agree with the appellant that it was not
    responsive to the jurys question.  There
    is at least a reasonable prospect that the jurys question related to the issue
    of whether disbelieving the complainant on one or more counts was something
    they could use when assessing her evidence on the other counts.  We also agree that there is a at least a
    reasonable prospect that the trial judges answer to the question could well
    have led the jury to think that they were not to take into account an adverse
    finding of credibility on one or more counts when assessing credibility on the
    remaining counts - even though this result was clearly not intended by the
    trial judge. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the time the question was posed, the trial judge did
    not know that the jury would convict on one count and acquit on other
    counts.  However, the appellant is
    entitled to have his appeal decided on the basis of the entire record and the
    verdict. In our view, given the acquittals on certain counts and the failure of
    the jury to agree on other counts, and given that the complainants credibility
    was a central issue at the trial, there is at least a strong possibility that
    some members of the jury either did not accept or were left with a reasonable
    doubt about the complainants credibility on the counts that did not result in
    conviction. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As Cory J. said in <i>R.
    v. S. (W.D.)</i> (1994), 93 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.) at p. 8:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There can be no doubt about the significance which
    must be attached to questions from the jury and the fundamental importance of
    giving correct and comprehensive responses to those questions.  With the question the jury has identified the
    issues upon which it requires direction.  It is this issue upon which the jury has focused.  No matter how exemplary the original charge
    may have been, it is essential that the recharge on the issue presented by the
    question be correct and comprehensive.  No less will suffice.  The jury
    has said in effect, on this issue there is confusion; please help us.  That help must be provided.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent further argues that in any event the
    jury would not have been misled by the answer because the application of
    credibility to all counts was a matter of common sense.  We cannot agree that it would be safe to rely
    on that proposition. In the light of the issues raised in the evidence, the
    jurys verdicts would indicate that credibility likely was the issue.  If, as we find, the trial judges answer
    suggested to the jury that they were not to apply a credibility assessment
    across counts, we are not prepared to assume that the jury would ignore that
    legal instruction and persist in deciding the case on the basis of common
    sense. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We also do not accept the Crowns argument that the
    jury would have asked a further question in the event they remained unclear
    about the issue of credibility.  This
    argument presupposes that the jury did not accept the trial judges instruction
    to consider the counts in isolation.  In the
    light of the trial judges instruction, the jury may well have been under the
    impression that the trial judge had fully answered their question and that they
    were bound by that answer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown also argues that the jurys verdicts do not
    provide information about what the jury did and did not believe and that the
    jury could have arrived at the verdicts for reasons unrelated to
    credibility.  Nonetheless, there remains
    a reasonable probability that the jurors who acquitted on some of the counts,
    absent the instruction, would have used their assessment of the complainants
    credibility to acquit the appellant on the count on which he was
    convicted.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the Crown argues that the jurys guilty
    verdict reflected the fact that it was the only count where the complainants
    evidence was corroborated by the complainants sister.  The count in question involved the allegation
    that the appellant on one occasion climbed into the complainants upper bunk
    bed and rubbed his penis against her leg through her clothing.  The sister did not describe witnessing sexual
    activity.  The only significant
    observation made by the sister was that she saw her step-fathers head going
    under the covers of the complainants bed on the morning in question.  However, this observation was not consistent
    with the complainants evidence or with the allegation.    The count did not contain an allegation of
    any other sexual misconduct. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We conclude that the appeal must be allowed, the
    conviction set aside and a new trial ordered.  In the light of that result, it is unnecessary to deal with the
    appellants sentence appeal.  </p>
