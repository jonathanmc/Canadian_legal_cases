  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown seeks leave to appeal and, if leave be
    granted, appeals the sentences imposed on the four respondents, who were all
    court officers with the Toronto Police Service.  The respondents were convicted of assaulting an individual being held as
    a prisoner in the holding cells of
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Old
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    City Hall courthouse in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto.  They were sentenced to conditional sentences
    ranging between 45 and 90 days plus 6 months probation and 50 hours of
    community service.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondents unleashed a vicious assault on a
    prisoner who had spilled juice on one of their fellow court officers.  Feeney, the supervisor, asked for
    “volunteers” and held a short meeting.  He then led a group of court officers, including the other three
    respondents, to the victim’s cell.  The
    victim was handcuffed from behind and shackled. When he refused to clean up the
    juice he was knocked to the ground and beaten.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the ensuing assault, the victim was kicked in the
    face, given flying kicks, and punched in the back and face.  In addition, the victim was grabbed by his bound
    hands and legs and his body was used as a mop to wipe the juice from the
    floor.  The trial judge found that the
    respondents attempted to cover up their involvement and that they falsified
    reports.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While we recognize the well-established principle that
    an appellate court owes deference to the sentencing judge, we are persuaded
    that the sentence imposed in this case was demonstrably unfit and that the
    trial judge erred by failing to give sufficient weight to the principles of
    general deterrence and denunciation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The conduct of the respondents must be considered in
    the light of the fact that they are officers in the justice system.  They owe a duty to the public to uphold the
    values of that system.  The respondents
    held a position of authority conferred upon them by virtue of their important
    public duties, and they owed the victim, a prisoner entrusted in their custody,
    a duty to take care for his safety. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When officers entrusted with such duties commit a
    collective, premeditated, vicious and humiliating assault upon a defenceless
    prisoner, and then try to cover up their actions, a sentence emphasizing the
    principles of deterrence and denunciation is called for.  We agree with the appellant that the
    situation was akin to a breach of trust which normally calls for a custodial
    term.  Moreover, this was a case where
    the values of our society and its justice system must be vindicated and
    reflected by a sentence that clearly tells those vested with power and
    authority that attacks by court officers on vulnerable prisoners will not be
    tolerated and that when they occur, serious sanctions will be imposed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In similar circumstances, the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    British Columbia Court of Appeal in <i>R. v. Bottrell (No. 2)</i> (1981), 62 C.C.C.
    (2d) 45, at p. 47:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The police are in a special position of power over
    prisoners….  The prisoner cannot run from
    a policeman without fear of a charge of escaping lawful custody.  There is really not much that a prisoner can
    do to protect himself against assaults by police officers.  The justice system puts the police officer in
    that position of power and, in my view, it is the justice system that must
    protect the prisoner.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The court went on to cite the following passage from
    the decision of the Appeal Division of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court in <i>R. v. Cusack</i> (1978), 41 C.C.C. (2d) 289,
    at p. 293:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my opinion, the paramount
    consideration in this case is the protection of the public from offences of
    this sort being committed by persons who are given special authority by our law
    to deal with individual members of society, and to deter such persons from
    acting in breach of their trust. All citizens must have confidence that police
    officers who are invested with substantial rights of interference with
    individual liberties exercise these rights with a scrupulous propriety, and
    that any failure to so act will result not only in dismissal from the position
    of trust but also in the imposition of substantial punishment.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The commission of
    offences by police officers has been considered on numerous occasions by the Courts,
    and the unanimous finding has been that their sentence should be more severe
    than that of an ordinary person who commits the same crime, because of the
    position of public trust which they held at the time of the offence and their
    knowledge of the consequences of its perpetration.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Likewise, in <i>R.
    v. Nixon</i> (1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 428, the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    British Columbia Court of Appeal stated at
    p. 432:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The gratuitous use of force on a
    defenceless prisoner in the confines of the police station lock-up is as reprehensible
    a crime in a free and democratic society as one can imagine, and one in which
    the appellant became deeply implicated by culpable inaction when he failed in
    his duty to the prisoner in his charge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the conditional sentences imposed manifestly
    failed to reflect those principles.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Bearing in mind that the respondents have served all or
    virtually all of their conditional sentences, we impose the following
    additional terms to be served in custody: The respondent Feeney 60 days; the
    respondent
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Findlay
    60 days; the respondent Kang 30 days; and the respondent Martin 45 days. </p>
