    assault in relation to eight different women on eight different occasions.  The key issue at trial was identity.  The trial judge granted the Crown’s similar
    fact application, ruling that the evidence on each count was admissible on all
    other counts.  In detailed and
    comprehensive reasons for judgment, the trial judge convicted the respondent on
    four counts but held that the Crown had failed to prove its case beyond a
    reasonable doubt on the remaining four counts and acquitted the respondent on
    those counts. </p>

    acquittals, and</span></h3>
  <h3><span

    trial judge erred by curtailing the cross-examination of one of the Crown’s
    witnesses.</span></h3>

    application for leave to appeal, allow the appeal and restore the convictions.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All eight assaults that formed the subject of these
    charges took place over approximately 12 weeks during the summer of 2002.  While there were some minor variations as to
    how the assaults were committed, essentially, in each case, the attacker came
    up suddenly from behind the female victim, grabbed her with one arm, thrust his
    other arm underneath her skirt to touch her vagina, quickly let go and ran
    away.  Each of the complainants testified
    that the attacker wore the collar of his t-shirt across the bridge of his nose
    to disguise himself.  The complainants
    were all able to give some description of their assailant’s physical appearance
    and some were able to describe the distinctive car he was driving.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown’s strongest case involved the assault on
    P.Y.  After she was assaulted, P.Y.
    chased her assailant but he managed to escape.  An independent witness, Fred Rosler, testified that he saw the
    respondent pull his car into a handicapped parking spot outside Rosler’s
    apartment and then saw the same man return on foot a few minutes later to enter
    the car and speed away.  Rosler was
    suspicious of the driver’s actions and he wrote down the licence plate number
    of the car.  The licence plate number led
    the police to the respondent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, Rosler was thoroughly cross-examined on the
    observations he made on the day of the assault against P.Y.  He was then cross-examined at considerable
    length on his general character and prior disreputable conduct.  This included questions related to the
    frequency of his employment and compensation he received for medical injuries,
    his extensive criminal record, the fact that he had suffered a nervous
    breakdown, a heart attack and a stroke, and suggestions that he had problems with
    alcohol and used marijuana.  The
    respondent’s counsel sought to further cross-examine the witness with respect
    to a number of issues including: a police report involving a complaint by his
    ex-girlfriend about a threat another man had made against her and that man’s
    complaint of Rosler’s threat; mention in a dated police report that Rosler had
    been admitted to hospital with mental illness; and another dated police report
    which had not resulted in charges.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge held a <i>voir dire</i> to canvass these proposed areas of cross-examination.  When asked, defence counsel indicated that
    the questions were not directed to the witness’s testimonial capacity or to his
    ability to relate his observations to the court but rather that they related to
    his credibility at large.  The trial
    judge concluded that these areas of proposed further questioning had no
    probative value, were little more than a fishing expedition intended to upset
    the witness, and that prohibiting the questioning would not imperil the
    respondent’s right to a fair trial.  Nonetheless, the trial judge gave defence counsel some latitude and
    allowed some further cross-examination.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent did not testify.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that the Crown had proved its
    case beyond a reasonable doubt in relation to the assault on P.Y.  He also convicted the respondent in relation
    to three other assaults given the strong similarities in evidence of
    identification of the assailant’s car, the assailant himself and the nature and
    location of the assaults.  The trial
    judge concluded with respect to the remaining four counts that, in light of
    certain frailties that he identified, he was left with a reasonable doubt and
    therefore, he acquitted the respondent on those counts.</p>

    because the trial judge had made a threshold ruling on the similar fact
    application that all of the offences were likely committed by the same person
    and as he had acquitted the accused on four of the counts, he was required to
    expressly consider the exculpatory value the acquittals had on the other
    counts. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree with the appellant that the summary conviction
    appeal court judge erred.  There is a
    fundamental distinction between the test for admissibility of similar fact
    evidence – proof on a balance of probabilities that the same person committed
    all eight attacks – and the test for conviction – proof beyond a reasonable
    doubt that the accused was the man who perpetrated four of those attacks.  As the Supreme Court of Canada stated in <i>R. v. Arp</i>,<i> </i>[1998] 3 S.C.R. 339, at para. 79, where the evidence on one count
    is admissible under the similar fact principle on other counts, “[t]here is
    nothing unfair or logically irreconcilable about a jury having reasonable doubt
    whether the accused committed an act while also finding that it is likely that
    he committed it.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the circumstances of this case, we fail to see how
    the trial judge’s acquittal on four counts had any exculpatory value on the
    other four counts.  It is clear from his
    reasons that the trial judge rigorously applied the proof beyond a reasonable
    doubt standard and that he was simply not satisfied of the respondent’s guilt
    to that standard on four counts. However, he certainly did not find, nor can
    one read into his reasons that, as the respondent puts it in his factum, he was
    satisfied that the respondent was not the attacker on four of the assaults
    resulting in acquittals.  We can read no
    more into the acquittals than that the trial judge was not satisfied of the
    respondent’s guilt on those counts beyond a reasonable doubt, a finding that is
    perfectly consistent with his finding that it is more likely than not that the
    same man committed all eight assaults.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The summary conviction appeal judge cited the following
    passage from <i>Arp</i> at para. 78:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>a careful instruction from
    the trial judge will be required.&nbsp; It will be necessary to explain to the jury
    that evidence adduced on one count upon which the jury would acquit may be used
    in assessing the liability on another count or counts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What this passage makes clear, in our view, is that
    even if the jury acquits on one count they can still use similar fact evidence
    arising from that count in relation to other counts, exactly the reverse of
    what the respondent submits.  While there
    may be situations where, on the particular facts of the case, an acquittal on
    one count could have exculpatory effect on another count, there is no air of
    reality that the facts of the present case give rise to that possibility.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the trial judge did not explicitly reject the
    alibi evidence led in relation to the W.S. count, he concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I cannot conclude that… the
    combination of the alibi evidence plus the dissimilarities in Ms. W.S.’s
    version of the events, would lead me to conclude anything other than; I have a
    reasonable doubt with respect to Mr. Mitchell’s guilt on that count.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly, while K.M.1 and K.M.2 thought they saw their
    assailant subsequent to the attacks and gave identifying features that differed
    from the respondent, in the end, the trial judge viewed that evidence as simply
    a weakness in their ability to identify the respondent.  In our view, none of this amounts to
    exculpatory evidence.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We respectfully disagree with the summary conviction
    appeal judge that the trial judge erred in limiting the cross examination of
    Rosler.  As the Supreme Court of Canada
    held in <i>R. v. Lyttle</i>, [2004] 1 S.C.R.
    193, at paras. 44 and 50:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The right of cross-examination must
    therefore be jealously protected and broadly construed.  But it must not be abused. Counsel are bound
    by the rules of relevancy and barred from resorting to harassment,
    misrepresentation, repetitiousness or, more generally, from putting questions
    whose prejudicial effect outweighs their probative value.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>wide latitude does not mean
    unbridled licence, and cross-examination remains subject to the requirements of
    good faith, professional integrity and the other limitations set out above.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the trial judge provided ample and
    persuasive reasons for limiting the cross-examination of Rosler.  The witness had been thoroughly cross-examined
    with respect to his observations and he had been subjected to a lengthy attack
    on his character which included exploration of his criminal past, his medical
    history, and the fact that he had suffered from mental illness.  When asked to justify further probing into
    these highly personal areas on what appeared to be a speculative basis, counsel
    conceded that his questions related only to the witness’s general credibility. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Trial judges are entitled to limit needless,
    repetitive, prolix and abusive cross-examinations as part of their overall
    obligation to control the process of the court, provided of course, that they
    respect the fundamental right of the accused to make full answer and defence.  In the circumstances of this case, we see no
    basis to interfere with the trial judge’s conclusion that the proposed areas
    for additional cross-examination lacked relevance and probative value, and that,
    in view of the fact that the witness’s character and past had already been
    explored in some considerable depth, the respondent’s right to make full answer
    and defence was in no way impaired by limiting the cross-examination. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons we grant the Crown’s application for
    leave to appeal, allow the appeal and restore the convictions entered at trial.
     Given his disposition of the conviction
    appeal, the summary conviction appeal judge did not deal with the sentence
    appeal.  That sentence appeal remains
    outstanding and is remitted to the Superior Court for determination.</p>
