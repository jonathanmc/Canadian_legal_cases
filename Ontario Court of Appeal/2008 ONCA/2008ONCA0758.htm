    Fleguel-Cannock (the child) be returned to Australia pursuant to the <i>Hague

    in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario. The mother, a Canadian, who had been living with the father in
    <st1:country-region

    when the child was conceived, returned to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario while pregnant with the child. The father was unable to come to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    at the time because he had a criminal record. He had pleaded guilty to assault
    with a weapon in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    in July, 2005, and been deported for the offence. The assault was on the
    boyfriend of a friend of the mother. The father had also been convicted of
    assault in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Australia</st1:country-region>
    in 1998. </p>

    the child was approximately five weeks old, the mother returned to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Australia</st1:country-region>
    and lived there with the father until they separated on October 29, 2007.
    She did so on about November 22, 2007 returning to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario with the child and his older sibling from a previous relationship.
    The father contacted the Central Authority<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

    securing the child’s return.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge found that as of November 22, 2007 the child was a habitual
    resident of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Australia</st1:country-region>
    within the meaning of the Hague Convention. He remarked that as of that date
    the child had lived in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Australia</st1:country-region>
    for some 16 1/2 of his 18 months of life. The application judge found that
    the mother knew that the father intended to apply to the Federal Magistrates
    Court in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Australia</st1:country-region>
    , for an order for joint custody of the child and for an order that the mother
    be restrained from removing the child from
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Australia</st1:country-region>
    and “took steps to covertly leave the jurisdiction.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    mother opposed the father’s application by relying on Article 13(b) of the
    Convention. Article 13(b) provides that a court may refuse to order the return
    of the child if there is a grave risk that the child would be exposed to
    physical or psychological harm or otherwise be placed in an intolerable situation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application proceeded on affidavit evidence. The mother filed her answer
    and supporting affidavits on May 2, 2008, the father replied with his affidavit
    on May 7, 2008, and the mother was permitted to file a further affidavit
    in reply at the hearing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    will set out the application judge’s summary of the mother’s evidence later
    in these reasons. In brief, the mother alleged the father was a violent criminal,
    a drug addict and trafficker, who was incapable of parenting and who had
    abused her. It was her position that the child would be exposed to physical
    or psychological harm if he were returned to the father’s care. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge concluded that the Article 13(b) standard was not met and
    ordered the child to be returned to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Australia</st1:country-region>
    . However, he indicated to the parties that he was considering seeking the
    involvement of the Department of Human Services in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Australia</st1:country-region>
    . In the end, he left it to the parties, either solely or jointly, to take
    whatever steps were appropriate and left it to counsel to arrange a hearing,
    if necessary, for the presentation of evidence and argument to determine
    the content of any undertakings to be entered into before the child’s return.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Issues</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge’s findings that the child was habitually resident in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Australia</st1:country-region>
    and that he was wrongfully removed from his habitual residence were not contested
    by the appellant. The issues the mother did raise </span>collapse into one:
    whether the trial judge erred by considering and determining the issue of
    the risk to the child under Article 13(b) without hearing <i>viva voce</i> evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    court, however, asked counsel to address whether the appeal should be stayed
    because it was premature. I first discuss this threshold issue.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Should the Appeal be Stayed
      because it is Premature?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    question whether the appeal was premature arose because the application judge
    had not yet finally disposed of the application at the time this appeal was
    heard. Jurisdiction was not the concern; the decision under appeal is final.
    The trial judge has finally decided that the mother cannot rely on Article
    13(b) to avert an order that the child be returned to
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Australia</st1:country-region>
    .  Nevertheless, this court had two concerns about proceeding with the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first concern was the fragmentation and protraction of proceedings under
    the Convention. Should the mother lose the appeal, the application judge
    would proceed to determine any undertakings that would govern the child’s
    return to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Australia</st1:country-region>
    . The mother took the position that, should she lose this appeal, she would
    have another right to appeal the undertakings that the application judge
    imposed at the subsequent hearing. Multiple appeals to dispose of an application
    are not conducive to the summary and expeditious process contemplated by
    the Convention.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second concern of this court was that any undertakings that the application
    judge would impose at the subsequent hearing could be germane to the determination
    of the issues raised on this appeal. This court in <i>Finizio v. Scoppio-Finizio </i>(1999),
    46 O.R. (3d) 226), relying on <i>Thomson v. Thomson, </i>[1994] 3 SCR 551,
    stated that Canadian courts can impose undertakings on parties to deal with
    the transition period between the time when a Canadian court makes a return
    order and the time at which the children are placed before the courts in
    the country of their habitual residence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Undertakings,
    by giving specific content to the order for return, are capable of defining
    the initial situation to which the child will return in the requesting State.
    Thus, leaving aside questions about the content, effectiveness and reliability
    of undertakings -matters to be addressed at the subsequent hearing - it seems
    clear that the undertakings imposed may well be relevant to the consideration
    of whether risk of harm to the child is of a sufficient degree for Article
    13(b) to apply. In this case, the specifics of how, to where and to what
    situation in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Australia</st1:country-region>
    the child is eventually returned may well affect the assessment of the degree
    of harm posed by the return itself. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    conclude on this issue, it is worth observing that it was to the appellant’s
    disadvantage to proceed with the appeal at this time. By proceeding with
    the appeal before the imposition of undertakings, it became necessary for
    the mother to persuade this court that the application judge erred irrespective
    of any undertakings the application judge may impose.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite
    our view that there was good reason to stay the appeal until the application
    judge had completely determined the application, we did not do so. In the
    absence of prior guidance by this court, we considered that the appellant
    should be given some leeway. Future appellants who proceed with appeals in
    like situations should not expect the same latitude. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    turning to the question raised by the appellant, it would be useful to review
    the main provisions of the Convention, and Article 13(b) in particular.</p>

    order is to be made expeditiously. Article 11 provides that “the judicial
    or administrative authorities of Contracting States shall act expeditiously
    in proceedings for the return of children.” The Article goes on to give the

    16 provides that the court in the State to which the child has been taken “shall
    not decide on the merits of rights of custody until it has been determined
    that the child is not to be returned under this Convention”. Thus, as LaForest
    J. put it in <i>Thomson</i>, “an application for return<i> </i>pursuant to
    the Convention pre-empts a local custody application”.  Or as this court

    ). Thus, where there has been a wrongful removal or retention, and no affirmative
    defence is established within the meaning of the Hague Convention...the children
    must be returned to their habitual residence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    philosophy of the Hague Convention is that it is in the best interest of
    children that the courts of their habitual residence decide the merits of
    any custody issue. Adhering to this philosophy ultimately discourages child
    abduction, renders forum shopping ineffective, and provides children with
    the greatest possible stability in the instance of a family breakdown. </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    central objective of the Convention to promptly repatriate abducted children
    to their habitual residence is subject to some limited exceptions. Article
    13(b) provides that the requested State is not bound to order the return
    of the child if “there is a grave risk that his or her return would expose
    the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child
    in an intolerable situation.” LaForest J., after reviewing decisions from
    several jurisdictions, said that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It has been generally accepted that the Convention
    mandates a more stringent test than that advanced by the appellant. In brief,
    although the word “grave” modifies “risk” and not “harm”, this must be read
    in conjunction with the clause “<u>or otherwise</u> place the child in an
    intolerable situation.” The use of the word “otherwise” points inescapably
    to the conclusion that the physical or psychological harm contemplated by
    the first clause of Article 13(b) is harm to a degree that also amounts to
    an intolerable situation... In <i>Re A. (A Minor) (Abduction), supra</i>,
    Nourse L.J., in my view correctly, expressed the approach that should be
    taken, at p. 372:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>... the risk has to be more than an ordinary
    risk, or something greater than would normally be expected on taking a child
    away from one parent and passing him to another. I agree ... that not only
    must the risk be a weighty one, but that it must be one of substantial, and
    not trivial, psychological harm. That, as it seems to me, is the effect of
    the words ‘or otherwise place the child in an intolerable situation’.</p>

    Convention on International Child Abduction”, emphasize the flexibility the
    Convention allows judges making an order of return to tailor the initial
    situation to which the child is returned. Citing the Australian case of

    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <i>Murray</i><i> v. Director, Family Services ACT </i>(1993) F.L.C. 92-416,  they
    say:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This flexibility in the drafting allows the child
    to come back and possibly remain with the abductor while the decision is
    reached on his future. This is of particular importance in the light of the
    current trend in abduction cases where the applicant, while having custody
    rights, might in fact have played a rather limited role in the actual care
    of the child. To take the child from the abductor would therefore be to create
    an entirely new custody situation which would not be in accordance with the
    reestablishment of the <i>status quo ante</i>.” </p>

    Supreme Court of Canada has recognized the flexibility that the Convention
    accords courts in the requested State. LaForest J. in <i>Thomson</i> observed
    that the
    “courts have recognized that frequently an unqualified return order can be
    detrimental to the short-term interests of the child in that it wrenches
    the child from its <i>de facto</i> primary caregiver.” He noted that the
    use of undertakings enables compliance with Article 12’s requirement that
    child be returned forthwith while ameliorating the short-term harm to the
    child. He reviewed approvingly th<span

    LaForest J. observed at para. 82, that in light of the undertakings “the
    court was satisfied that the child’s interest was safeguarded while the Convention
    was honoured.”  In <i>Thomson</i> one of the undertakings was that the father
    would not take physical custody of the child upon his return to

    absence of compelling evidence to the contrary or evidence that it is beyond
    the powers of those courts in the circumstances of the case, the courts of
    this country should assume that this will be done. Save in an exceptional
    case, our concern, i.e., the concern of these courts, should be limited to
    giving the child the maximum possible protection until the courts of the
    other country -

    recently, Lord Justice Wall in <i>Re W (a Child)</i>, [2005] 1 F.L.R 727
    cautioned:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>it is always of the utmost importance to remember…that
    these are summary proceedings, and that the object of the proceedings, subject
    to the defences under Article 13, is to ensure that the child or children

    for their futures to be decided in that country where, of course, the relevant

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    despite the flexibility the Convention allows the judge making an order for
    return, the role of a court in an Article 13(b) case remains a limited one.
    Article 13(b) does not supply the court with jurisdiction to conduct the
    type of inquiry appropriate in a custody dispute. The court must consider
    only whether there should be a departure from the general rule mandating
    summary return of the child because the stringent test of Article 13(b) has
    been met, and if not, what should be the initial situation to which the child
    is returned. Thereafter, the best interests of the child vis a vis his or
    her permanent custody arrangement, are left to the courts of the requesting
    State.</p>

    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Wales</st1:country-region>
    succinctly stated what I consider the proper approach in <i>Re W (a Child)</i>.
    At para. 23 he said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The experience and the instinct of the trial judge
    is always to protect the child and to pursue the welfare of the child. That
    instinct and experience sometimes is challenged by the international obligation
    to apply strict boundaries in the determination of an application for summary
    return. The authorities do restrain the judges from admitting oral evidence
    except in exceptional cases. The authorities do restrain the judges from
    making too ready judgments upon written statements that set out conflicting
    accounts of adult relationships. What the authorities do not do is to inhibit
    the judge from himself or herself requiring oral evidence in a case where
    the judge conceives that oral evidence might be determinative. The judge’s
    conduct of the proceedings is not to be restricted by tactical or strategic
    decisions taken by the parties. However, to warrant oral exploration of written
    evidence, the judge must be satisfied that there is a realistic possibility
    that oral evidence will establish an Article 13(b) case that is only embryonic
    on the written material.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    turn now to whether this was one of those rare exceptional cases that required
    oral evidence. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US>The Mother’s Evidence</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge in this case fairly summarized the mother’s evidence as
    follows at para. 12 of his reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[The mother], in her material filed with this court,
    alleges that [the father] is dysfunctional as a parent and a disreputable
    citizen. She alleges that he is incapable of serving [the child’s] best interests.
    It is her allegation that [the father] possesses no parenting skills, has
    no legal source of employment/income, is an active participant in the drug
    subculture and indeed is a producer and seller of illicit drugs. She further
    alleges that he has been physically, verbally and emotionally abusive towards
    her. She alleges that he is a violent criminal. It is her position that should
    [the child] be returned to the care of his father that [the child] will be
    exposed to physical or psychological harm and consequently this court should
    refuse to return [the child] to the jurisdiction of the Australian courts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    can be seen, the mother’s evidence focuses on the merits of the custody dispute
    and does not address the risk to the child in being returned to the state
    of his habitual residence where the Australian courts would determine his
    best interests. Her position is stated clearly in her formal Answer to the
    Application: the child “would be placed in a situation of danger if returned
    to Applicant in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Australia</st1:country-region>
    and placed in his care.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge properly recognized that this issue of the risk to the
    child from a return to the father was not before him. He noted that the test
    was whether the child “should be returned to the jurisdiction of the Australian
    courts” and the issue of the best interests of the child were not before
    him. He went on remark that the Australian courts may well award custody
    of the child to the mother, but he had no jurisdiction to make that determination.
    In considering Article 13(b) he applied the test as stated in <i>Thomson</i> by
    LaForest J.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,
    as the application judge noted, there was no allegation that the father had
    ever physically harmed the child. The issue is psychological harm. Certainly
    the risk of physical assaults on or psychological abuse of a mother is capable
    of establishing the risk of psychological harm to a child. The mother, however,
    did not allege that she left or could not return to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Australia</st1:country-region>
    because of fear of abuse and did not express any doubts about the ability
    of Australian institutions to protect her. The application judge specifically
    observed that her reasons for not wishing to return to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Australia</st1:country-region>
    related to her other children. He noted that this made the situation different
    from the circumstances in <i>Mahler</i> where the mother’s reasons for not
    wishing to return related to the alleged risk that would be posed to the
    child. Even then, in <i>Mahler</i>, the child was ordered returned, albeit
    in the physical custody of the mother if she chose to accompany the child. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge also observed that the father’s alleged lack of parenting
    skills did not seem to be of great concern to the mother in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Australia</st1:country-region>
    . This inference was open to him, given the mother’s evidence that after
    leaving the father on October 29, 2007 following the one physical assault
    she alleged, she continued to allow the father to care for the child, though
    she adds that he did not fare well and would telephone her to come and pick
    the child up. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is evident that the application judge considered that the evidence in this
    case, on the whole, is similar to that in <i>Finizio</i>, where this court
    set aside the application judge’s finding that Article 13(b) applied, and
    is not comparable to that in <i>Pollastro v. Pollastro </i>(1999), 43 O.R.
    (3d) 485 (Ont. C.A)<i>, </i>where this court allowed the mother’s Article
    13(b) application<i>. </i> We were not persuaded that the trial judge’s view
    of the evidence was incorrect, let alone that there was a basis for interfering
    with it. He concluded that the evidence did not establish the risk of physical
    or psychological harm of a degree that amounted to an intolerable risk under
    Article 13(b).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    said, the application judge indicated that he had some concerns and signalled
    that he was considering the return of the child to the Child Protection and
    Family Services Branch of the Department of Human Services in the State of
    Victoria, Australia. It seems to me he was correct to take into account possible
    harm to the child even if it fell short of the Article 13(b) standard.  An
    important aspect of his task was to fashion the appropriate undertakings
    to address the logistics of the return as well as his concerns as to the
    child’s welfare.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    noted above Lord Justice Thorpe’s observation in <i>Re W (a Child)</i>, that “[t]he
    experience and the instinct of the trial judge is always to protect the child
    and to pursue the welfare of the child.” This may lead to perceiving a certain
    tension between an order for return and the best interests of the child in
    the short term. Lord Justice Thorpe later added:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[I]t seems to me that those misgivings have no
    validity other than to return to the debate issues that have been aired extensively
    during the course of the negotiation of this Convention and in the ensuing
    decade of its international use. These issues have been debated repeatedly
    at Special Commissions convened by the Permanent Bureau and there can be
    no doubt at all that the conclusion of the international community is that
    only the robust construction and application of the Convention will serve
    to militate against the risks and dangers of the wrongful removal and retention
    of children. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> LaForest
    J. in <i>Thomson</i> reviewed in some detail the negotiation and adoption
    of the Convention. He concluded that “...the legislature's adoption of the
    Convention is indicative of the legislature's judgment that international
    child custody disputes are best resolved by returning the child to its habitual
    place of residence.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge fully appreciated the philosophy and objectives of the
    Hague Convention and the standard that had to be met to establish an Article
    13(b) defence. His approach paid proper regard to the obligation on the abducting
    parent to seek the protection of the courts in the jurisdiction of habitual
    residence and to obtain the permission of those courts to remove the child
    from his or her country of habitual residence.  He also correctly recognized
    that in this case, the Australian courts are the most appropriate venue for
    the determination of the merits of the custody dispute.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    concluding, it must be noted that the mother in this case did not request
    the application judge to hear oral evidence. Represented by counsel, the
    mother was content to proceed on the basis of the written material filed.
    She did not seek to cross-examine on the father’s affidavits and at the hearing
    sought and was granted permission to file a further affidavit in reply.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    conclude, the argument that the determination of the mother’s Article 13(b)
    defence required oral evidence is simply not tenable. Certainly, there are
    many factual matters in dispute and resolution of those facts may be relevant
    to the custody dispute of the parties.  However, it cannot be said there
    was a realistic possibility that oral evidence would establish an Article
    13(b) defence that was only embryonic on the written material. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    close with the additional caution that the bifurcation of the application
    proceedings as in this case in this case is not to be encouraged. It would
    be preferable that application judges determine all issues and the undertakings
    required at a single hearing.  </p>

    talks about children’s “prompt return to the State of their habitual residence”.</p>
