  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Alecia
    Fisher was born at
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Victoria
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Hospital in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    London at 10 p.m. on February 4, 1991. At around 9 p.m., while Mrs. Fisher
    was in active labour, nurses were unable to reliably detect a fetal heart
    rate for a period of between twelve and seventeen minutes. Despite this problem,
    doctors did not intervene, and Mrs. Fisher proceeded to a vaginal delivery.
    Alecia was not breathing spontaneously at birth and had to be resuscitated.
    Doctors eventually determined that she suffered asphyxia during labour, which
    led to cerebral palsy with all its tragic and devastating effects. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Alecia’s
    parents sued the obstetrician who attended Alecia’s birth, the anaesthetist,
    a paediatrician who assisted in the resuscitation efforts, an obstetrical
    resident, an intern, most of the nurses who were present during labour and
    delivery, and the hospital. In addition to saying that the doctors were negligent
    in failing to expedite Alecia’s birth, Alecia’s parents claimed that the
    hospital’s fetal heart monitoring protocol was below standard, that the nurses
    were negligent in carrying out the monitoring, and that proper monitoring
    every 15 minutes would have detected the asphyxia before 9 p.m., leading
    to intervention. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    parties agreed on damages prior to trial and, by the end of the 61-day trial,
    only the obstetrician and the hospital remained as defendants. Rady J. dismissed
    the negligence claim against the obstetrician, but held the hospital vicariously
    liable for the negligence of its nurses. Although she determined that the
    hospital’s protocol requiring intermittent monitoring of the fetal heart
    every thirty minutes during the active phase of the first stage of labour
    met an acceptable standard of practice, the trial judge found that the nurses
    breached the standard of care by failing to auscultate<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Concerning
    causation, the trial judge found that Alecia’s brain injury was the result
    of the cumulative effect of a period of acute near total asphyxia that occurred
    at around 9 p.m., and an earlier period of prolonged partial asphyxia that
    occurred in the hours before birth. As no irregularities in the fetal heart
    rate were detected at other times when the fetal heart was being monitored
    properly, the trial judge concluded that the prolonged partial asphyxia likely
    occurred between 6:00 p.m. and 7:30 p.m.  Had the nurses auscultated the
    fetal heart as required at 6:30 and 7:00 p.m., electronic fetal heart monitoring
    would likely have commenced, and that, in turn, would inevitably have led
    to an expedited delivery, “thereby sparing Alecia the magnitude of her injuries.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    appeal, the hospital does not contest the trial judge’s findings that the
    nurses breached the standard of care by failing to auscultate the fetal heart
    at 6:30 and 7:00 p.m.; that the factual cause of Alexia’s brain injuries
    was the cumulative effect of prolonged partial asphyxia and acute near total
    asphyxia; and that the acute near total asphyxia occurred at around 9 p.m.
    Rather, the hospital claims that the trial judge misapprehended important
    evidence about when the prolonged partial asphyxia occurred and reached her
    conclusions on that issue and on the liability of the hospital based on a
    theory that was not pleaded, and based on a series of findings and assumptions
    that are not supported by the evidence. The hospital raises the following
    issues on appeal:</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:normal;'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Did
    the trial judge err in law and make a palpable and overriding error by making
    factual findings and inferences in support of a judicial theory of negligence
    that are unsupported by the evidence and by inadvertently applying the benefit
    of hindsight?</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:normal;'><span

    the trial judge err in law by finding the hospital liable based on a theory
    of negligence that was not raised by the respondents at trial?</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:normal;'><span

    the trial judge err in law by misapplying the legal test of causation?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal and order a new trial.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:normal;'><b>II. Background</b></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:normal;'><b>      i) The events
      surrounding Alecia’s birth</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mrs.
    Fisher was admitted to hospital at 4:37 p.m. on February 4, 1991. Alecia
    was Mrs. Fisher’s second child, and Mrs. Fisher was considered a low risk
    patient.<a href="#_ftn2"
name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a> The hospital protocol required that intermittent
    fetal heart monitoring increase from every hour to every 30 minutes once
    a low risk mother reached the active phase of the first stage of labour.
    Although the hospital led evidence that Mrs. Fisher did not reach that phase
    until 7:30 or 8:00 p.m., the trial judge found that Mrs. Fisher commenced
    active labour at 6 p.m. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is no dispute that fetal heart monitoring occurred by auscultation at 4:45,
    4:55, 6:00, 7:30, 7:55; 8:00, and 8:35 p.m., and that on all these occasions,
    the fetal heart rate was in the normal range of 120 to 160 b.p.m.<a href="#_ftn3"
name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[3]</span></span></span></a> It is also clear that auscultation did not occur
    as required at either 6:30 or 7:00 p.m.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents took no issue at trial with the nurses’
    actions at 9 p.m., when they were unable to detect a fetal heart rate. Indeed,
    the trial judge found that the nurses took “all appropriate steps, including
    the application of oxygen, turning Mrs. Fisher from side to side and increasing
    the intravenous level.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the minutes after 9 p.m., the nurses made multiple attempts to locate a fetal
    heart rate. As many as four different nurses tried to locate the fetal heart
    rate through auscultation. In addition, they tried using a transducer and
    a fetascan.<a href="#_ftn4"
name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[4]</span></span></span></a> The transducer briefly displayed a fetal heart
    rate of 96-113 b.p.m. However, the nurses could not hear an audible fetal
    heart beat and were unable to maintain the fetal heart rate on screen. Although
    they thought they picked up the fetal heart on the fetascan, one of them
    described the fetal heart as “barely fluttering”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    the nurses were unable to locate a fetal heart rate, they paged the obstetrical
    resident, Dr. MacMillan. At around 9:05 p.m., they re-paged Dr. MacMillan
    and also paged an obstetrician present in the hospital, Dr. Atack.  Mrs.
    Fisher’s obstetrician, Dr.&nbsp;Maynard, was also paged but was unable to
    attend as he was at another
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    London hospital, attending another birth. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the time that he was paged, Dr. MacMillan was in the operating room assisting
    Dr. Atack with surgery on a patient with an ectopic pregnancy. Dr. MacMillan
    left the operating room and went to Mrs. Fisher’s labour room within minutes,
    while Dr. Atack remained in the operating room to complete the surgery. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    9:10 p.m., the nurses charted the fetal heart rate at 60-90 b.p.m. and, at
    about 9:12 p.m., the fetal heart rate was recorded by auscultation at 130
    b.p.m. Dr. MacMillan arrived, ruptured the amniotic membranes, and placed
    a fetal heart rate monitor on Alecia’s scalp (a scalp clip). At 9:17 p.m.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[5]</span></span></span></a>, the fetal heart rate was detected by the scalp
    clip and was recorded as improved at 145-150 b.p.m.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that Dr. Atack arrived in the labour room at about 9:25
    p.m. The fetal heart rate was around 150 b.p.m. at that point. Although there
    had been two variable decelerations, down to between 90 and 100 b.p.m., since
    electronic monitoring  began, they were brief in duration. Dr. Atack monitored
    Mrs. Fisher over about five minutes during two contractions and observed
    no decelerations in the fetal heart rate. As labour appeared to be progressing
    fairly rapidly, he approved administration of an epidural. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Atack observed three more decelerations in the fetal heart rate before Mrs.&nbsp;Fisher
    was transferred to the delivery room, one just before 9:38, one at 9:39,
    and one at 9:41 p.m. He felt that the first two were not concerning and that
    the third was associated with a vaginal examination in which he confirmed
    that Mrs. Fisher was fully dilated. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    Mrs. Fisher began pushing, Dr. Atack observed further decelerations in the
    fetal heart rate, but always with recovery. During the final two minutes
    before birth the fetal heart rate dropped to 50-60 b.p.m. Alecia was born
    at 10:00 p.m. by spontaneous vaginal delivery. She was limp and not breathing
    at birth. Her umbilical cord was wrapped loosely around her body and her
    head.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Alecia
    was ultimately diagnosed as suffering from a dyskinetic form of cerebral
    palsy, marked by dystonic and athetoid movement in all four of her limbs.<a href="#_ftn6"

    is quadriplegic. She is also slightly microcephalic, meaning she has a smaller
    than average head. Alecia exhibits some cognitive deficits and learning problems.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    electronic fetal heart rate tracings for the period between 9:17 p.m. and
    10:00 p.m. were filed as an exhibit at trial. There was no issue at trial
    that Alecia’s brain injury was caused by asphyxia during labour. However,
    the precise timing and mechanism of the injury was vigorously disputed. Much
    of the evidence at trial related to these issues and to the question of whether
    Dr. Atack fell below the standard of care by failing to expedite Alecia’s
    delivery based on what he was told by the nurses about what happened at around
    9 p.m., and based on the fetal heart rate tracings, both before and after
    he arrived.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>III. The Positions of
      the Parties at Trial</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    thrust of the respondents’ position at trial was that Alecia suffered brain
    damage either in the period of five to ten minutes before birth or in the
    period of about two minutes before and two minutes after birth, and that
    Dr. Atack caused or materially contributed to her injuries, primarily by
    failing to recognize the need to take steps to expedite her delivery. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents claimed that, at some point during labour, an unknown process

    to some extentopined that the process probably began somewhere between 40
    to 50 minutes and up to one to two hours before birth, and culminated either
    in the five to ten minute period or in the two minute period prior to delivery.
    The process resulted in either a prolonged partial asphyxia that became increasingly
    severe; an acute near total asphyxia; or more likely a combination of both
    forms of asphyxia. Whatever the form of the asphyxia, the respondents claimed
    that it did not cause injury until the final minutes before Alecia’s birth
    and that her injuries could have been avoided had Dr. Atack expedited her
    delivery. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition to their allegations against Dr. Atack, the respondents claimed
    that the hospital’s fetal heart rate monitoring protocol for low risk patients
    requiring intermittent monitoring of the fetal heart every thirty minutes
    during the active phase of the first stage of labour was below standard and
    that proper monitoring every fifteen minutes would have detected the asphyxia
    before 9 p.m., and would have led inevitably to intervention. The respondents
    also claimed that the method of auscultation used by at least one of the
    nurses was below standard. Finally, the respondents claimed that the nurses
    breached the standard of care by failing to monitor the fetal heart rate
    in accordance with the hospital’s protocol. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    doctors’ position at trial was that all doctors met the standard of care,
    that the timing of Alecia’s brain injury could not be established with precision,
    and that, in any event, her brain injury did not occur within the final minutes
    before birth. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    thrust of the hospital’s position at trial was that its fetal heart rate
    monitoring protocol met an acceptable standard of practice and that the nursing
    care provided to Mrs. Fisher equalled or exceeded the standard of care.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>IV. The Trial Judge’s
      Reasons</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge began the analysis portion of her reasons by considering the
    negligence claim against Dr. Atack. She concluded that Dr. Atack met the
    standard of care in deciding to monitor the fetal heart rate and in permitting
    Mrs. Fisher to continue to vaginal delivery. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge then turned to the question of whether any breach of the standard
    of care that Dr. Atack may have committed caused or materially contributed
    to Alecia’s brain injury. She began this portion of her reasons by stating, “[c]ritical
    to the analysis of causation is the timing of Alecia’s brain injury and the
    precision with which it can be measured.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    a section entitled Conclusions: Causation, the trial judge noted that there
    were three scenarios advanced to explain Alecia’s brain injury: i) acute
    near total asphyxia; ii) prolonged partial asphyxia; and iii) a mixed form
    of asphyxial exposure. She concluded that Alecia suffered both a prolonged
    partial asphyxia and an acute near total asphyxia in the hours before birth,
    and that the events around 9 p.m. represented the end of an acute near total
    asphyxia. As Dr. Atack did not assume responsibility for Alecia’s care until
    after these events, the trial judge found no causal link between any possible
    breach by him of the standard of care and Alecia's injury. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge summarized her reasons for these findings as follows:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Having considered the evidence,
    I am not satisfied that it is possible to pinpoint the timing of Alecia’s
    injury with minute accuracy and certainly not to within minutes of birth,
    particularly in the absence of a sentinel event. Moreover, there is no objective
    evidence of an acute near total event at this time. There are only two minutes
    of bradycardia which by itself is insufficient to cause the extent of Alecia’s
    injury. I am not satisfied that there is evidence pointing to a sentinel
    event during this interval. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>I am satisfied that the
    following findings of fact are supported by the evidence on a balance of
    probabilities. Alecia most probably sustained intrapartum asphyxia. There
    was, more likely than not, a period of prolonged partial asphyxia and a period
    of more acute asphyxia, the cumulative effect of which accounts for the pattern
    of brain injury that she sustained and the type of cerebral palsy that she
    exhibits. While it is not possible to pinpoint the timing of the asphyxial
    insult(s) with complete precision, I accept Dr. Watts' evidence that there
    was likely both partial prolonged asphyxia and an acute near total event
    that occurred in the hours before birth. I accept Dr. Watts’ opinion that
    the partial prolonged asphyxia occurred in the hours before birth and that
    the events at [9:00 p.m.] represented the tail end of a bradycardia representing
    a near total acute insult. In this regard, I accept Ms. Rawlins’ testimony
    about her observation that the fetal heart was barely fluttering. There is
    no doubt in my mind that Ms. Rawlins, an experienced labour and delivery
    nurse, knew what she was seeing-a heart that was beating very slowly.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>The foregoing events all
    occurred before Dr. Atack assumed responsibility for Mrs. Fisher’s care.
    As a result, if I had found Dr. Atack breached the standard of care, I can
    find no causal connection between the breach and the damages sustained.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge then turned to the respondents’ claim against the hospital. She
    rejected the respondents’ submissions concerning the protocol for auscultation
    and the method of auscultation used by at least one of the nurses. She found
    that the hospital’s protocol for low risk mothers requiring intermittent
    monitoring of the fetal heart every thirty minutes during the active phase
    of the first stage of labour and the methods of auscultation used by the
    nurses met an acceptable standard of practice. However, based on a finding
    that Mrs. Fisher was in the active phase of the first stage of labour at
    6 p.m., the trial judge concluded that the nurses breached the standard of
    care by failing to auscultate the fetal heart at 6:30 and 7 p.m.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to causation, the trial judge concluded that the respondents had
    established that Alecia’s injuries were caused by the nurses’ negligence
    for which the hospital is vicariously responsible. She found that there was
    either a bradycardia<a href="#_ftn8"
name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[8]</span></span></span></a>  or decelerations of the fetal heart during the
    period of up to 17 minutes after 9 p.m. during which the nurses were unable
    to auscultate the fetal heart, which was consistent with what Dr. Watts thought
    was an acute near total event. As she had already concluded that there was
    an earlier period of prolonged partial asphyxia, the trial judge found that
    it likely occurred between 6 p.m. and 7:30 p.m. when the fetal heart was
    not being properly monitored. The fact that no irregularities in the fetal
    heart rate were detected at other times when proper monitoring occurred supported
    this finding. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge then concluded: </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>[I]t seems reasonable to
    infer that if the nurses auscultated the fetal heart between [6:00 and 7:30
    p.m.], they would have detected decelerations or perhaps a bradycardia of
    the fetal heart, raising concern that some form of asphyxial event was occurring.
    It further seems reasonable to conclude that they would have conducted the
    appropriate nursing interventions and they would have likely summoned assistance.
    It is likely that Dr. MacMillan would have responded in the same fashion
    as he did at [9:15 p.m.], namely by rupturing the membranes and attaching
    a fetal scalp clip. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>In my view, the electronic
    tracing would have detected the magnitude of the bradycardia (or decelerations)
    occurring at [9:00 p.m.] and would have shown that an acute event was occurring,
    consistent with Dr. Watt’s view. There can be no doubt that in such circumstances,
    steps would have been taken to expedite delivery, thereby sparing Alecia
    the magnitude of her injuries.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>V. Analysis</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    hospital’s initial submission under its first ground of appeal is that the

    a prolonged partial asphyxia that preceded the events around 9 p.m. I do
    not accept this submission and I will address this issue first. </p>

    addition, the hospital submits that the series of findings on which the trial
    judge relied in order to find that the hospital caused Alecia’s injuries
    reflect a misapplication of the law of causation and, in any event, lack
    an evidentiary foundation. I will address these issues in turn. As I have
    concluded that these issues are dispositive of the appeal, it is unnecessary
    that I address the remaining issues raised by the hospital. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>1. Did the trial judge

    hospital contends that, in making her findings about the timing of Alecia’s

    occurred in the minutes before birth and relied instead on the doctors’ theory
    of causation, with particular emphasis on the evidence of Dr. Watts. The
    hospital claims that in finding that Alecia suffered a prolonged partial

    hospital points in particular to two portions of the trial judge’s reasons.
    In the section of her reasons setting out her conclusions on causation in
    relation to Dr. Atack, the trial judge said the following:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>I also accept Dr. Watts’ evidence
    with respect to the type of insult Alicia likely endured and his testimony
    with respect to timing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>…</p>

    to pinpoint the timing of the asphyxial insult(s) with complete precision,
    I accept Dr. Watts' evidence that there was likely both partial prolonged
    asphyxia and an acute near total event that occurred in the hours before
    birth. <u>I accept Dr. Watts’ opinion that the partial prolonged asphyxia
    occurred in the hours before birth and that the events at [9:00 p.m.] represented

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Later,
    in the section of her reasons setting out her conclusions on causation in
    relation to the hospital, the trial judge said this:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>It seems clear that during
    this latter interval [from 9:00 p.m. for a period of up to 17 minutes], there
    was either a bradycardia or decelerations of the fetal heart, consistent
    with what Dr. Watts thought was an acute near total event. <u>As I have already
    accepted on the basis of Dr. Watts’ testimony, there was an earlier episode
    of partial prolonged asphyxia</u> that occurred in the hours before birth.
    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>The trial judge then stated
    that it was reasonable to infer that the prolonged partial asphyxia occurred
    between 6:00 and 7:30 p.m.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According
    to the hospital, Dr. Watts did not opine that Alecia suffered a period of
    prolonged partial asphyxia that preceded the events around 9 p.m. Rather,
    his opinion was that the most significant period relating to Alecia’s injury
    was around 9 p.m., that Alecia likely suffered a prolonged bradycardia representing
    a near total acute asphyxia between about 8:45 p.m. and 9:08 p.m., that brain
    damage began in that time frame and likely occurred predominantly between
    9:00 and 9:08 p.m., and that a period of prolonged partial asphyxia continued

    way of illustration, the hospital points to the following excerpts of Dr.
    Watts’ evidence, given while he was being cross-examined by the hospital’s
    trial counsel:</p>
  <p>Q. Dr. Watts, I just have a few questions for you. As I understand your
    evidence, in coming to your opinion, you took a retrospective look at all
    of the evidence that you had before you and concluded that Alecia suffered
    both a near total acute hypoxic event and a partial prolonged hypoxic event.
    Is that correct?</p>
  <p>A. That's correct. </p>
  <p align=center style='
text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p>Q. And if I understood your evidence, and once again, looking retrospectively
    at both, you looked at the clinical evidence together with the obstetrical
    evidence and you concluded that the near total acute event likely occurred
    at or prior to [9:00 p.m.]? </p>
  <p>A. Yes. I think that's... </p>
  <p>Q. Is that a fair statement? </p>
  <p>A. ...that's, that's reasonable. </p>
  <p align=center style='
text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p>Q. And again, looking at that same evidence, being both the clinical evidence
    and the obstetrical evidence, you came to the conclusion that the most likely
    scenario was that, to some degree, there was a prolonged, <u>there was prolonged
    partial hypoxia that continued after [9:00 p.m.]</u>... </p>
  <p>A. Yes.</p>
  <p>Q.... for whatever the timing of the actual injury was in and around the
    time of [9:00 p.m.]. Is that. .. </p>
  <p>A. That's right. </p>
  <p>Q....a fair statement. </p>
  <p>A. Yes. </p>
  <p align=center style='
text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p>Q. Would it be fair to say, given the 13 minutes that we have the objective
    evidence of either bradycardia and/or deep decelerations or a rather slow
    return to normalcy, that the bradycardia would not have started too long
    before [9:00 p.m.]? </p>
  <p>A. Not too long before?</p>
  <p>Q. If it started before [9:00 p.m.], it wouldn't have been 20 minutes before
    [9:00 p.m.]? </p>
  <p>A. It's not likely to be that long before.</p>
  <p align=center style='
text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p>Q. And the actual timing of the injury would have been probably close to
    [9:00 p.m.] on either side of it? </p>
  <p>A. The timing of the start of -yes. </p>
  <p>Q. It, and it could have been after [9:00 p.m.]? </p>
  <p>A. Yes, it could. </p>
  <p>Q. And at [9:00 p.m.]? </p>
  <p>A. Yes. </p>
  <p>Q. All right. And as I also understand, again, using your clinical judgment
    and opinion based on all of the evidence you've reviewed, that you came to
    the opinion that in addition to the near total acute that you believe Alecia
    suffered as evidenced by the events surrounding [9:00 p.m.], that I think
    you used the term -or based on your sort of differential diagnosis -you believe
    the most likely scenario was that a <u>prolonged partial continued after..</u> </p>
  <p>A. <u>After.</u>.. </p>
  <p><u>Q. [9:00]? </u></p>
  <p><u>A....that time, yes</u>. </p>
  <p>(Emphasis added by the hospital.) </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not accept the hospital’s submissions. I have read both the trial judge’s
    reasons and Dr. Watts’ evidence several times. Although Dr. Watts may not
    have expressed a medical opinion that a prolonged partial asphyxia preceded
    the events around 9 p.m., he was not in a position to do so because there
    was no clinical evidence of a prolonged partial asphyxia before 9 p.m. to
    support such a hypothesis. However, he clearly recognized the possibility
    of an earlier prolonged partial asphyxia as illustrated by the following
    extract from his examination-in-chief:</p>
  <p>Q.  Dr. Perlman did concede in cross-examination that Alecia Fisher could
    have had a brain disabling exposure earlier than the last five minutes, sorry,
    five to ten minutes - and I emphasize the phrase “could have” - and still
    exhibited these blood gases that we see in Exhibit 4.  Do you agree or disagree
    with that proposition?</p>
  <p>A.  Yes.  I, I, I do agree.</p>
  <p>Q.  And how does that proposition relate, if at all, to your opinion as
    to how Alecia Fisher's brain injury occurred?</p>
  <p>A.  I think it's somewhat similar to my opinion.</p>
  <p>Q.  In what way?</p>
  <p>A.  In, in, in that I think there, there is likely to have been a significant
    event at around nine o'clock.  There may have been a contribution of the,
    of subsequent prolonged partial or intermittent asphyxia to the, to the base
    deficit or to the blood gases, but it seems unlikely to me, looking at the
    rest of the picture that that contribution would have changed her outcome
    in a significant way.<span style='font-size:12.0pt'> </span></p>
  <p>Q.  And in your opinion, is it possible that there was prolonged partial
    asphyxia before the serious episode that happened, as you posited, at around
    [9:00 p.m.]?</p>
  <p>A.  Yes.  Or, it, it's certainly possible.  It's really unknown.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I read her reasons, the trial judge was fully cognizant of this nuance in
    Dr.&nbsp;Watts’ testimony. I am not persuaded that she misapprehended Dr.
    Watts’ evidence. Read fairly, in my view, the trial judge’s reasons indicate
    that she relied on Dr. Watts’ evidence concerning the possibility of a prolonged
    partial asphyxia before 9 p.m. together with her analysis of the totality
    of the causation evidence to conclude that Alecia suffered a period of prolonged
    partial asphyxia that preceded the events around 9 p.m. In my view, it was
    open to the trial judge to do so. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is important to consider the trial judge’s findings on causation in context.
    The trial judge conducted her analysis of the respondents’ claims in ten
    main sections: three sections dealing with whether Dr. Atack met the standard
    of care; three sections on causation in relation to Dr. Atack; three sections
    dealing with whether the hospital and the nurses met the standard of care;
    and a concluding section addressing causation in relation to the nurses. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
    of the way in which the trial judge structured her reasons, she reviewed
    the bulk of the law in relation to causation and the bulk of the causation
    evidence when addressing the claim against Dr. Atack. When reviewing the
    law, she noted the limits on an expert’s ability to express an opinion on
    causation as compared to a trier of fact’s ability to take a “robust and
    pragmatic approach” to the evidence and to find causation proven on a balance
    of probabilities even in the absence of a firm medical opinion:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Causation often cannot be
    demonstrated with scientific precision. <u>It is essentially a question of

    ordinary common sense</u>. [Citation omitted.] [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>…</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>However, in some circumstances… an
    inference of causation may be drawn from the evidence without positive scientific
    proof. This is known as the “robust and pragmatic” approach to causation.

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>It is not necessary to secure
    a firm medical expert opinion on the existence of causation. Medical experts
    tend to speak in terms of scientific certainties that are more stringent
    than the standards required by the law. As noted above, the legal standard
    only requires demonstration on a balance of probabilities. [Citation omitted.] </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge reviewed the expert causation evidence extensively when dealing
    with the claim against Dr. Atack. This section of her reasons consists of
    109 paragraphs spanning 24 pages. As noted above, the focus of her inquiry
    at this stage was evidence concerning the timing of Alecia’s brain injury.
    She began with a brief overview of the opinions of the main causation experts
    and then reviewed the evidence relating to each of the factors affecting
    their opinions on timing. </p>

    her overview of Dr. Watts’ opinion, the trial judge referred both to his
    evidence about the possibility that a prolonged partial asphyxia occurred
    before 9 p.m. and to his evidence that a prolonged partial asphyxia likely
    occurred after 9 p.m. She said:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Dr. Watts testified that
    he would expect to see a bradycardia lasting 10-15 minutes if there were
    a prolonged partial asphyxia. He felt that the asphyxia occurred before the
    onset of electronic monitoring. <u>He thought there was likely a significant
    event at around [9:00 p.m.] and that it was certainly possible that there
    was a partial prolonged asphyxia before the serious episode at around [9:00
    p.m.]</u></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>…</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>He thought the most likely
    cause of Alecia’s injury was a combination of an acute near total event and
    prolonged partial asphyxia. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Dr. Watts testified as follows:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>A.  Essentially, my, my
    summary was that when one puts together the findings on the, the heart rate
    pattern, and her physical findings, and the investigations, including the
    CT scan, blood tests and everything else, it points to the most likely form
    of injury being an acute near total insult with, probably with a prolonged
    partial component.  And the absence of evidence that that prolonged, that
    acute near total insult took place at the end of labour makes it considerably
    more likely, in my mind, that that acute near total insult took place earlier.  <u>And
    one logical time for that is the period immediately prior to [9:00 p.m.],
    [9:05 p.m.], and that that, that, the observations at that point represented
    the tail end of such an acute near total event.  There may well have been
    a combination of prolonged partial asphyxia, particularly in, in, either
    in the form of cord compression and/or changes in uterine blood flow that

    on the, on the fetal heart tracing that that's so unlike what one sees in
    severely injured infants at birth.  In fact, it's a pattern that is seen
    commonly in, in the, the second stage of labour in babies who are otherwise
    normal, that the substantive injury is likely to have been that that occurred
    earlier, as, as I say, probably at around [9:00 p.m.] hours. [Emphasis added.]</p>

    that significant brain injury occurred in the final minutes before birth,

      premature and massive separation of the placenta from the uterus, premature
      major abruption, or prolapse of the umbilical cord. </p>

    in the absence of a sentinel event, “timing brain injury becomes more difficult.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>The trial judge observed
    that only Dr. Perlman thought there was evidence of a sentinel event between
    9:17 and 10:00 p.m. He thought that the last few moments of the fetal heart
    rate tracing showed evidence of a severe bradycardia, i.e., a fetal heart
    rate less than 60 b.p.m., indicating a sentinel event. The other experts
    disagreed. None of them thought there was evidence of a sentinel event during

      that Alecia began having seizures at 40 minutes of age; and that Dr. Watts
      testified that seizures do not begin until hours after an asphyxial event. </p>

    Dr. Schifrin’s evidence about an ominous sawtooth pattern on the fetal heart

    having seizures <i>in utero</i>. Although other experts did not agree with
    Dr. Schifrin’s opinion, the trial judge observed that if there was a sawtooth
    pattern on the tracing shortly after it began, “that would seem to indicate

      and putamen). In addition, one expert testified that Alecia may also have
      suffered brain stem injury. A significant portion of the expert evidence

    an acute near total asphyxia to explain the pattern of her brain injury.
    She also highlighted Dr. Perlman’s evidence that Alecia’s brain injury could
    have been caused by any one of the three forms of asphyxia (acute near total,
    prolonged partial, or a combined form of asphyxia); that the more typical
    clinical picture of a combined form of asphyxia is prolonged partial followed
    by acute near total; and that 40 minutes of prolonged partial asphyxia at
    the more severe end of the spectrum followed by acute near total asphyxia
    would be a perfect model to explain Alecia’s injuries. </p>

    whether there is any correlation between the type of cerebral palsy Alecia
    suffers and the likely form(s) of asphyxial insult. The trial judge concluded

      involvement.</b> The trial judge explained the general consensus of the
      expert witnesses that Alecia’s multisystem injury (injury to parts of the
      body other than the brain) tends to support the likelihood of a prolonged
      period of asphyxia. Multisystem injury can occur where the fetus compensates
      for asphyxia by shunting blood to the brain, heart and adrenal glands at
      the expense of other bodily systems. Where an acute near total insult occurs,
      the shunting mechanism does not have time to respond in the same way. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Dr. Perlman, in particular,
    noted the presence of kidney dysfunction, liver dysfunction and transient
    cardiovascular abnormality, indicating an asphyxial event in the 12-24 hours

    timing device”. Dr. Watts agreed that the indications of transient cardiovascular
    abnormality are a reliable marker of prolonged partial asphyxia and also
    that kidney dysfunction is not a fine timing device. </p>

    only at some point following the onset of asphyxia. She noted Dr. Perlman’s
    evidence that elevated lymphocyte levels are only seen within a few hours
    after the onset of an asphyxial insult and that the presence of nucleated

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Concerning Dr. Watts’ opinion,
    the trial judge said he agreed with Dr. Perlman that lymphocyte counts could
    not be used to pinpoint the timing of a brain injury to within five to ten

      to this issue in detail. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Alecia’s blood gas values
    at birth were 23 mmol. per litre (arterial) and 17 mmol. per litre (venous)
    respectively. Base deficits in excess of 16 mmol. per litre are known to
    lead to brain damage. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>The trial judge noted that
    Dr. Perlman relied on the difference between Alecia’s arterial and venous
    gas levels at birth (the AV difference) in formulating his opinion that Alecia
    suffered a sentinel event in the last six minutes before birth. He opined
    that the six mmol. AV difference had accumulated at the rate of one mmol.
    per litre as a result of complete oxygen deprivation during the last six
    minutes before birth, indicating a sentinel event. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>However, the trial judge
    observed that there was no evidence of total asphyxia during the period from
    9:54 to 10:00 p.m. Rather than an immediate and persistent fall in the fetal
    heart rate, a pattern of recurrent variable decelerations with a return to
    baseline continued until the final two minutes before birth when the heart
    rate went down and stayed down. Dr. Watts testified that the returns to baseline
    were inconsistent with Dr. Perlman’s theory. He also said that Alecia’s fetal
    heart rate tracings during the period between 9:17 and 10:00 p.m. are of
    a type commonly seen in the second stage of labour and are usually associated
    with normal infants. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>The trial judge also noted
    Dr. Low’s evidence that, despite Alecia’s accumulated base deficit, the actual
    oxygen levels in the umbilical artery and vein at the time of sampling indicated
    the blood gas exchange occurring at the time of birth was good. In addition,
    the trial judge referred to Dr. Watts’ testimony that base deficit accumulates
    more slowly in cases of prolonged asphyxia as well as Dr. Low’s evidence
    that there was nothing in the last six minutes of the labour that could be
    responsible for the six mmol. rise in the arterial base deficit from 17 to
    23. Dr. Low testified that this rise could be explained by a prolonged partial
    asphyxia.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>The trial judge concluded
    that the clinical data in this case does not support “the window of injury
    postulated by the plaintiffs to be as narrow as either the six minutes before
    birth or the 3½ to four minutes before birth and the 90 seconds following
    delivery.” </p>

    reviewing the foregoing evidence, the trial judge set out her conclusions
    on causation in relation to Dr. Atack. While essentially rejecting the respondents’ theory,
    she commented favourably on the evidence of Drs. Low,
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Watts and Schifrin. She said: </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Dr. Low’s view was that
    an acute total or near total exposure just before birth was not likely because
    there was no evidence of a sentinel event and no evidence of prolonged terminal
    bradycardia. The renal complications exhibited by Alecia point to asphyxia
    over time. Similarly, the blood gases at the time of delivery are inconsistent
    with an acute asphyxial exposure of short duration just before birth. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>On the other hand, Dr. Watts
    opined <u>that it was more likely that the injury did involve an acute near
    total component as well as a prolonged partial component, but he felt that
    it occurred earlier than at the end of labour.</u> He thought the acute component
    likely occurred at around [9:00 p.m.].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Dr. Schifrin also testified
    that there was “surely” some form of oxygen deprivation before [9:00 p.m.].
    He further agreed that there could have been a severe, prolonged cord compression
    between [8:35] and [9:00 p.m.] and that the 17 minutes during which the nurses
    could not auscultate a fetal heart rate could represent the tail end of such
    a severe, prolonged cord compression. [Emphasis added.]</p>

    relationship to the type of asphyxial insult, she rejected Dr. Armstrong
    and Dr. MacGregor’s evidence as dogmatic and as tied to out-dated studies,
    and stated:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>I also accept Dr. Watts’ evidence

    was only after this analysis and review that the trial judge set out her
    conclusions on causation as set out in paragraph 27 above (repeated here
    for ease of reference):</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Having considered the evidence,
    I am not satisfied that it is possible to pinpoint the timing of Alecia’s
    injury with minute accuracy and certainly not to within minutes of birth,
    particularly in the absence of a sentinel event. Moreover, there is no objective
    evidence of an acute near total event at this time. There are only two minutes
    of bradycardia which by itself is insufficient to cause the extent of Alecia’s
    injury. I am not satisfied that there is evidence pointing to a sentinel
    event during this interval. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>I am satisfied that the
    following findings of fact are supported by the evidence on a balance of
    probabilities. Alecia most probably sustained intrapartum asphyxia. There
    was, more likely than not, a period of prolonged partial asphyxia and a period
    of more acute asphyxia, the cumulative effect of which accounts for the pattern
    of brain injury that she sustained and the type of cerebral palsy that she
    exhibits. While it is not possible to pinpoint the timing of the asphyxial
    insult(s) with complete precision, I accept Dr. Watts' evidence that there
    was likely both partial prolonged asphyxia and an acute near total event
    that occurred in the hours before birth. I accept Dr. Watts’ opinion that
    the partial prolonged asphyxia occurred in the hours before birth and that
    the events at [9:00 p.m.] represented the tail end of a bradycardia representing
    a near total acute insult. In this regard, I accept Ms. Rawlins’ testimony
    about her observation that the fetal hear was barely fluttering. There is
    no doubt in my mind that Ms. Rawlins, an experienced labour and delivery
    nurse, knew what she was seeing-a heart that was beating very slowly.</p>

    precise accuracy and certainly not to within minutes of birth; ii) Alecia
    was injured as a result of the cumulative effects of a prolonged partial

    was not impaired by the failure of any medical witness to testify that it
    was in fact the cause. Neither can it be impaired by the lack of medical
    unanimity as to the respective likelihood of the potential causes of the
    aggravation, or by the fact that other potential causes of the aggravation
    existed and were not conclusively negated by the proofs. The matter does
    not turn on the use of a particular form of words by the physicians in giving
    their testimony. The members of the jury, not the medical witnesses, were
    sworn to make a legal determination of the question of causation. They were
    entitled to take all the circumstances, including the medical testimony,
    into consideration. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    as indicated in the quotation from <i>Snell</i> at paragraph 54 above, the
    robust and pragmatic approach does not shift the burden of proof away from
    the plaintiffs. Rather, the plaintiff must still “provide an evidentiary
    foundation for finding that there is a substantial connection between the
    injury and the defendant’s conduct”:<i> Barker v. Montfort Hospital</i> (2007),
    278 D.L.R. (4th) 215, at para. 54. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    as this court emphasized at paras. 54 and 60 of <i>Aristorenas</i>, the robust
    and pragmatic approach offers a method for evaluating evidence. It is not
    a substitute for evidence that the defendant’s negligence caused the plaintiff’s
    injury; nor does it change the amount of proof required to establish causation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    just as the robust and pragmatic approach cannot be used as a substitute
    for evidence, it cannot be used as a substitute for reviewing and making
    findings about relevant evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Put
    another way, the robust and pragmatic approach does not permit drawing inferences
    concerning either the ultimate issue of causation or links in the chain of
    causation without reviewing the relevant evidence and without making findings
    about the range of available inferences. As Rouleau J.A. pointed out at para.
    63 of <i>Aristorena</i>s, quoting from <i>Fairchild v. Glenhaven Funeral
    Services</i>, [2002] 3 All E.R. 305 (H.L.), at para.  150, common sense cannot
    become a substitute for resort to the evidence:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>[E]ven though it is always
    for the judge rather than for the expert witness to determine matters of
    fact, the judge must do so on the basis of the evidence, including the expert
    evidence. The mere application of “common sense” cannot conjure up a proper
    basis for inferring that an injury must have been caused in one way rather
    than another.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>            ii) Application
      of the Law to the Facts of this Case</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s finding that the nurses caused Alecia’s injury is contained
    in a section of her judgment entitled
    “Conclusions: Causation”. This section follows immediately after a section
    dealing with the nurses’ standard of care and comprises five paragraphs.
    The essence of the trial judge’s reasoning is set out in the following three
    paragraphs: </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>It seems clear that during
    [the period of up to 17 minutes after 9 p.m.] there was either a bradycardia
    or decelerations of the fetal heart, consistent with what Dr. Watts thought
    was an acute near total event. As I have already accepted on the basis of
    Dr. Watts’ testimony, there was an earlier episode of partial prolonged asphyxia
    that occurred in the hours before birth. <span lang=EN-US>I find that it
    is </span>more likely than not that this occurred between [6:00 and 7:30
    p.m.] when the fetal heart was not being auscultated. There is support for
    this conclusion because no decelerations or bradycardia were detected at
    the other times when the fetal heart was being auscultated properly. Furthermore,
    I have already concluded that Alecia’s injuries were caused by this combination
    of asphyxial insults. As a result, I am satisfied that the plaintiffs have
    established on a balance of probabilities that Alecia’s injuries were caused
    by the negligence of the nursing staff for which the hospital is liable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>In particular, <u>it seems
      reasonable to infer </u>that if the nurses auscultated the fetal heart
      between [6:00 and 7:30 p.m.], they would have detected decelerations or
      perhaps a bradycardia of the fetal heart, raising concern that some form
      of asphyxial event was occurring. <u>It further seems reasonable to conclude </u>that
      they would have conducted the appropriate nursing interventions and they
      would have likely summoned assistance. It is likely that Dr. MacMillan
      would have responded in the same fashion he did at [9:15 p.m.], namely
      by rupturing the membranes and attaching a fetal scalp clip. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>In my view, the electronic
    tracing would have detected the magnitude of the bradycardia (or decelerations)
    occurring at [9:00 p.m.] and would have shown that an acute event was occurring,
    consistent with Dr. Watt’s view. There can be no doubt that in such circumstances,
    steps would have been taken to expedite delivery, thereby sparing Alecia
    the magnitude of her injuries. [Emphasis added.]</p>

    trial judge made the first five of these findings following a detailed review
    of the relevant evidence. However, her sole reference to the evidence in
    relation to her final four findings was to the evidence that no decelerations
    or bradycardia were detected on the occasions when the fetal heart was auscultated
    properly. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s central findings that the prolonged partial asphyxia occurred
    between 6:00 and 7:30 and that the nurses would have detected it had they
    auscultated the fetal heart as required at 6:30 and 7:00 p.m. rest on a conclusion
    that the prolonged partial asphyxia that occurred before 9 p.m. was detectable
    by intermittent auscultation every half hour. However, the trial judge made
    no explicit finding to that effect, stating instead that it was “reasonable
    to infer that if the nurses auscultated the fetal heart [as required], they
    would have detected decelerations or perhaps a bradycardia”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, taken as a whole, the trial judge’s reasons indicate that she made
    the final four findings based on common sense, applying the robust and pragmatic
    approach. Although I agree that that approach can be used to evaluate evidence
    and to draw reasonable inferences concerning the issue of ultimate causation,
    particularly in a case involving complex medical evidence, it cannot be used
    as a substitute for reviewing relevant evidence and making necessary findings
    of fact.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>None
    of the expert witnesses at trial testified that Alecia’s injury was caused
    in the precise manner determined by the trial judge. As I have said, the
    respondents’ experts testified that the asphyxial insult began between 40-50
    minutes and up to one to two hours before birth and that the injury happened
    within minutes of birth. The balance of the expert evidence was divergent,
    but no one expressed an opinion that corresponds to the findings of trial
    judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    and in particular, there was no expert evidence specifically relating to
    the crucial issues of whether the earlier period of prolonged partial asphyxia
    likely occurred between 6:00 and 7:30 p.m. and concerning whether and when
    the earlier period of prolonged partial asphyxia would likely have been detected
    by intermittent auscultation at half hour intervals. However, although there
    was no expert evidence at trial addressing these issues specifically, there
    was extensive expert evidence concerning the nature of prolonged partial
    asphyxia and some expert evidence concerning when and how it can be detected.
    The trial judge did not review any of this evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Among
    other things, the evidence relating to prolonged partial asphyxia indicated
    that it can take several forms. For example, it can be intermittent or persistent;
    or it can be persistent with intermittent periods of increased severity.
    In addition, the severity and duration of prolonged partial asphyxia that
    will lead to injury can vary dramatically. In this respect, there was relative
    consensus among the experts at trial that prolonged partial asphyxia must
    last a minimum of about 30 to 35 minutes to itself cause injury. However,
    it was also clear that a more moderate form of the asphyxia may require several
    hours to cause damage. Further, Dr. Low testified that short recurrent episodes
    of asphyxia may have a cumulative effect so that an exposure that may not
    itself cause any damage could cause damage if repeated over time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    was also expert evidence concerning whether, in a combined form of asphyxia,
    the prolonged partial component would be separated from the acute near total
    component. Dr. Armstrong testified that it is<span
style='font-size:12.0pt'> </span>unlikely that the two forms of asphyxia would
    be separated from each other; physiologically, it is more likely that one
    form of asphyxia would progress to the other. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    there was conflicting expert evidence at trial concerning the likelihood
    of prolonged partial asphyxia being detected. For example, although speaking
    in terms of the likelihood that electronic heart rate monitoring would have
    picked up Alecia’s distress, Dr. Schifrin testified:</p>
  <p>A.
    …It is medically implausible that a normal baby will have any degree of oxygen
    deprivation during labour and not reveal it.  It is unknown that a baby who
    starts out normal and who is subjected to any form of oxygen deprivation
    during labour, will not fail to show there’s a problem.  I may have said
    that confusingly.  Will not fail to show it has a problem.  Let me try and
    say that it...</p>
  <p>Q.  How will it show it?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>A.  Oh, by having decelerations.  There
    is no known example of a baby, normal to start, subjected to oxygen deprivation
    during labour who will not immediately manifest a response to that oxygen
    deprivation, whatever the mechanism of the oxygen deprivation, and will not
    fail to tell you, the reasonable observer will not fail to tell you that
    I have a problem.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Q.  And so, if there had
    been fetal heart rate monitoring with the tracing since the beginning, are
    you saying that would have shown there?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>A.  Yes.  I believe it would
    have been normal.  And on the basis of that, having believing that it would
    have been normal, it is, I believe, medically implausible, implausible that
    the fetus would not, would have failed to have decelerations in response
    to any form of oxygen deprivation during labour.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Q.  And so, you are saying
    that some time before [9:00 p.m.], there was some form of oxygen deprivation?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>A.  Yes, reasonably, from
    one mechanism or another.  Surely.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Q.  Sure.  And had there
    been a tracing, it would have, that deprivation would have shown in the tracing
    as a deceleration?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>A.  Immediately, yes.  And
    immediately, and reasonably at a time when something could have been done
    about it, without question.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    although speaking about a standard of monitoring requiring auscultation every
    15 minutes, Dr. Bernstein said:</p>
  <p>Q.  And you would expect that if an asphyxial event was occurring during
    labour while you're auscultating, if you were listening by auscultation,
    more likely than not, the fetal heart would at some point exhibit some abnormality
    - be it bradycardia, tachycardia, or decelerations which would suggest to
    the listener that this is something that needs to be either assessed electronically,
    or prompt some other action - but you would expect the listener to observe
    something?</p>
  <p>A.  Well, I mean, I think that was the belief that auscultation could provide
    you with that information.  So, I would hope that it was true, otherwise
    there's no point in doing it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Watts’ evidence about the indicia of prolonged partial asphyxia is complicated.
    At one point in his evidence, he seemed to say that a prolonged partial asphyxial
    insult that causes injury will manifest irregularities in the fetal heart
    rate for longer than 30 minutes:</p>
  <p>Q.  Then let's turn to prolonged partial asphyxia.  Is it possible to say,
    as with acute true total asphyxia, it takes roughly this long in partial
    asphyxia to injure the brain?</p>
  <p>A.  It's difficult because prolonged partial asphyxia is very, very variable
    in its severity, so there's going to be a wide difference in the amount of
    time that it takes for brain damage to occur.  One can start with the evidence
    from the animal experiments that prolonged partial asphyxia of a very severe
    nature takes a minimum of 30 minutes to cause brain damage.  And it's commonly
    stated as being prolonged hypoxia at a level less than ten to 15 percent
    of normal.  However...</p>
  <p>.</p>
  <p>Q.  Sorry.  Ten to 15 percent of what value?</p>
  <p>A.  Of, of, of, of the normal oxygen level...</p>
  <p>Q.  In the blood?</p>
  <p>A.  ... oxygen saturation.</p>
  <p>Q.  Very good.</p>
  <p>A.  It's usually expressed by people like Myers in terms of volumes percent
    of, of oxygen in the blood and .5 to 1.5 volumes percent through roughly
    ten, five to 15 percent.  And we also know that at levels of hypoxia higher
    than that, at about 40 percent...</p>
  <p>Q.  So, less severe?</p>
  <p>A.  So, less severe.</p>
  <p>Q.  Yes?</p>
  <p>A.  One begins to get changes in the fetal blood pressure and the fetal
    heart rate.  And presumably in most infants, the actual asphyxial insult
    will have started with when the oxygen level is even higher than that 40
    percent.  So - and it may be easier if I, if I drew this as a graph, but...</p>
  <p>Q.  Well, you drew a sketch for me quite recently.</p>
  <p>A.  Yeah.</p>
  <p>Q.  And that's why we have the easel up.  And I wonder if you could go to
    that sketch for Her Honour now and explain what you're trying to tell us.</p>
  <p>A.  If, if one plots the level of oxygen in the fetus - and it doesn't matter
    whether it's percent or volumes against time - what we know is that if it's
    below...</p>
  <p>Q.  Can I - I'm very sorry to interrupt you.  Are we speaking about an animal
    experiment now or...</p>
  <p>A.  We're talking about animal experiments.</p>
  <p>Q.  Okay.  Go ahead.</p>
  <p>A.  If, if we, if we, if we call it 100 percent, 40 percent and ten percent,
    at roughly ten percent a period of 30 minutes is sufficient to cause brain
    damage, but in order to get to the 30 - that ten percent, the oxygen level
    is, in the fetus has to fall, and it's falling from somewhere up in, in,
    in this, this range.</p>
  <p>Q.  When you say “this range”, roughly what?</p>
  <p>A.  Between 40 and 100.</p>
  <p>Q.  All right.</p>
  <p>A.  When it reaches 40, it will start to produce bradycardia.  So that,
    in saying that 30 minutes of severe asphyxia is sufficient to cause brain
    damage, we're saying that some longer period of bradycardia would be associated
    with brain damage.  And that's why it's difficult to apply this 30 minute
    figure from the animal experiments directly to what you observe in labour
    or, labour and delivery because you actually start the timing probably from
    the point at which you can see something happen to the fetal heart tracing.  In
    fact, the asphyxial insult has even been there for longer than that because
    there's a period before you start to see changes in the heart rate when the
    oxygen is still dropping.  That period is probably relatively short because
    that's the point where the oxygen levels change fastest.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    shortly after giving that evidence, Dr. Watts appeared to suggest that the
    external manifestations of  an injury-causing prolonged partial asphyxia
    could cover a much shorter period:</p>
  <p>Q.  Can you answer this question then?  If you're seeing a prolonged period
    of that deep low oxygen level having been produced by some pattern of prolonged
    partial asphyxia, can you tell us what one would expect to see on the electronic
    fetal monitor tracing?</p>
  <p>A.  I would expect to see some evidence of late decelerations at an earlier
    stage in, in this, and of a persistent bradycardia at a later stage.</p>
  <p>Q.  What do you mean by “persistent?”</p>
  <p>A.  A bradycardia lasting at least ten to 15 minutes, maybe longer.</p>
  <p>Q.  And what sort of frequency of late decelerations would you expect to
    see?  Or, if you can't tell us, I don't want to push it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>A.  I'm not sure whether
    I can tell you in terms of frequency.  I certainly would get alarmed if I
    saw more than four or five.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    in cross-examination by trial counsel for the hospital, Dr. Watts agreed
    that prolonged partial asphyxia can go undetected:</p>
  <p>Q.  All right.  And as I also understand, again, using your clinical judgment
    and opinion based on all of the evidence you've reviewed, that you came to
    the opinion that in addition to the near total acute that you believe Alecia
    suffered as is evidenced by the events surrounding [9:00 p.m.], that I think
    you used the term - or based on your sort of differential diagnosis - you
    believe the most likely scenario was that a prolonged partial continued after...</p>
  <p>A.  After...</p>
  <p>Q.  ... 21:00?</p>
  <p>A.  ... that time, yes.</p>
  <p>Q.  And even though there isn't - I think as you suggested - evidence on
    the tracing, that that, it continued during the period of time when the fetal
    monitor was on.</p>
  <p>A.  Yes.</p>
  <p>Q.  And it doesn't surprise you, as you've told us, that that could have
    occurred where the prolonged partial continued and was not evident from the
    tracing that was generated, because that's something you've seen, I'm not
    going to say frequently, but it's not uncommon.</p>
  <p>A.  That's correct.</p>
  <p>Q.  Is that correct?</p>
  <p>A.  Yes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, Dr. Gagnon seemed to suggest that the fetal heart rate will not
    necessarily reflect an asphyxial episode:</p>
  <p>Q.  Dr. Gagnon, do you agree with me, to get me back on track, that if there
    had been auscultation before [9:00 p.m.], every 15 minutes, every five minutes
    after every contraction, whatever model you want to take, that it would have
    picked up an asphyxial event?</p>
  <p>A.  Certainly, it would have picked up abnormality in the heart rate that
    could be suggestive of an asphyxial event...</p>
  <p>Q.  Thank you, sir.</p>
  <p>A.  ... whether or not that heart rate event would reflect an asphyxial
    episode or not, that's not necessarily true.</p>

    the trial judge set out her initial findings on causation in the section
    of her judgment dealing with the liability of Dr. Atack she reviewed the
    relevant expert evidence carefully and in detail before setting out her conclusions.
    However, in contrast to her approach in that section, in the section of her
    judgment dealing with the liability of the hospital, the trial judge did
    not review the relevant expert evidence at all. In fairness to the trial
    judge, this was a long trial involving complicated medical evidence and the
    parties did not assist her. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Out
    of almost 500 pages of written closing submissions, the respondents’ trial
    counsel (not Mr. Pape) devoted one paragraph to the submission that an asphyxial
    event occurred between 6:00 and 7:30 p.m. that would have been picked up
    by auscultation every half hour:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Even if the standard had
    been every 30 minutes, a period of 1 ½ hours from [6:00 to 7:30 p.m.] would
    be below the standard, and it could well be that there may have been some
    hypoxic events during this time which would have been picked up by proper
    auscultation, therefore alerting the nursing staff and physicians of such
    possibility. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Trial counsel did not review
    the evidence capable of supporting this submission. Moreover, despite the
    obvious risk to the hospital’s position if failure to auscultate during this
    period was found to be a breach of the standard of care, the hospital (not
    Mr. Rogers or Ms. Varjacic) did not respond directly to this issue. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless,
    to make a finding of causation based on a robust and pragmatic approach,
    in my view, it was incumbent on the trial judge to consider and make findings
    about the evidence relevant to the medical issues. This is particularly the
    case where there was no opinion evidence dealing directly with the theory
    of causation determined by the trial judge. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I have said, there was evidence that was relevant to the crucial questions
    of the nature of prolonged partial asphyxia and whether and when the earlier
    period of prolonged partial asphyxia could and should have been detected.
    At least some of that evidence concerning intermittent prolonged partial
    asphyxia and how it manifests itself pointed to a realistic prospect that
    the earlier period of prolonged partial asphyxia may not have been detectable
    by auscultation at half hour intervals. In my opinion, before drawing an
    inference of causation against the hospital, the trial judge was required
    to consider the relevant evidence and to make findings, on the standard of
    a balance of probabilities, eliminating the prospect that the earlier period
    of asphyxia was not detectable. I conclude that she misapplied the law of
    causation by failing to do so.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is not possible for this court to make the necessary findings.  To do so
    would require findings of fact on conflicting evidence and including issues
    of credibility.  Regrettably, therefore, there must be a new trial, unless
    the hospital can show that there was no evidence to support a finding of
    causation based on the nurses’
    negligence.  I now turn to that issue.</p>

    Fisher entered active labour at 6 p.m., that Alecia’s injury was the result
    of the cumulative effect of a prolonged partial asphyxia and combined near
    total asphyxia suffered during labour, and that Alecia suffered an acute
    near total event around 9 p.m., the hospital contends that there was no evidentiary
    foundation for inferences the trial judge drew. I disagree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    have already rejected the hospital’s claim that the trial judge made a palpable
    and overriding error in finding that the prolonged partial asphyxia that
    contributed to Alecia’s brain injury preceded the events around 9 p.m. In
    addition, I have identified some evidence that may have supported a finding
    that the prolonged partial asphyxia would have been detectable, which, in
    turn, may have supported an inference that it occurred between 6 and 7:30
    p.m. However, as I have said, before drawing that inference, it was necessary
    that the trial judge review and make findings about the evidence suggesting
    that the earlier prolonged partial asphyxia would not have been detectable.</p>

    my view, there was also some evidence at trial capable of supporting the
    trial judge’s further inferences that, having detected decelerations or bradycardia,
    the nurses would have summoned help, electronic fetal heart rate monitoring
    would have commenced and would have detected the events around 9 p.m., which,
    in turn, would have led to an expedited delivery alleviating the magnitude

    and concerning whether Drs. Muir (the anaesthesiologist) and Atack could
    have been available to perform a crash caesarean section prior to 9 p.m.,
    depending on the trial judge’s findings concerning what happened between

    necessary. Depending on the nature of the earlier problem that was detected,
    it may have been reasonable to infer that it was incumbent on the medical

      Second, it must be clear that the defendant breached a duty owed to the
