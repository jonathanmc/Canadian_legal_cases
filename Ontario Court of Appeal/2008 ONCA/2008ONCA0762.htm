    the amendment because the applicable limitation period under s.&nbsp;38(3)

    negligent treatment of Mr. Spirito.</p>

    motion judge, applying the so-called “litigating finger” test, held that
    this was a case of misnomer.  Accordingly, the appellants, although misnamed,
    had been sued within the two year limitation period provided for in the <i>Trustee
    Act</i>.  She therefore permitted the amendment to the claim.</p>

    basic submission of the appellants is that s. 21 of the <i>Limitations Act</i> has
    abolished the common law doctrine that allowed the addition and substitution
    of parties after expiry of a limitation period where the plaintiff could
    show special circumstances.  Section 21 provides as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>s. 21(1)&nbsp;If a limitation
    period in respect of a claim against a person has expired, the claim shall
    not be pursued by adding the person as a party to any existing proceeding.</p>

line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    court has recently dealt with s. 21(1) in two cases.  <i>Meady v. Greyhound
    Canada Transportation Corp.</i>, 2008 ONCA 468 was a case where the transition
    provisions of s. 24 of the Act applied because the act or omission took place
    before the effective date of the new Act (January 1, 2004) but no proceeding
    against the person sought to be added as a party had been commenced before
    the effective date.  As a result of the transition provisions, this court
    held that the former limitation period applied, consequently so did the common
    law of special circumstances. Section 21(1) of the new Act did not apply.  In <i>Joseph
    v. Paramount Canada’s Wonderland</i>, 2008 ONCA 469, this court dealt with
    the application of s. 21 where the new <i>Limitation Act</i> did apply.  Speaking
    for the court, Feldman J.A. held that the effect of s. 21(1) was to abolish
    the doctrine of special circumstances.  As she held at para. 16, “s. 21 of
    the Act precludes the addition of parties to an existing action after the
    expiry of a limitation period”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants in this appeal rely upon <i>Joseph</i>.  They submit that s. 19
    of the Act preserves the limitation period found in s. 38(3) of the <i>Trustee
    Act</i> and since the two year limitation period expired, the appellants
    cannot be added as parties.  Finally, they submit that <i>Meady</i> does
    not apply because the transition provision in s. 24 does not apply.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would leave to another day the issue of the application of s. 24 to a case
    where the claim was brought after the effective date but the governing limitation
    period is one preserved by s. 19.  In so doing, I am not determining whether
    s. 21 applies in this case. I do so because I am satisfied that the result
    in this case is the same whether or not s. 21 of the Act applies.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Result

line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Prior
    to the enactment of the <i>Limitations Act, 2002</i>, this court had held
    that a limitation period does not expire where the statement of claim did
    not identify the particular defendant by name but otherwise identifies them.  The
    court held in <i>Kitcher v. Queensway General Hospital</i> (1977), 44 O.R.
    (3d) 589 (
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), at p. 591 as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The appellants’
    motion sought to name the defendant correctly <i>not to add him as a party</i>.  Dr.
    Cramer can no more claim the benefit of a limitation period defence than
    he could if he had been properly named within the prescribed statutory period
    but not served until after the period had expired.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly,
    in this case, on the findings of the motion judge, the plaintiffs simply
    sought to correctly name the appellants, not add them as parties.  Thus,
    no issue of expiry of a limitation period arose.  The only issue then is
    whether the motion judge correctly held that the statement of claim had identified
    the appellants.  Or, put another way, was this a case of misnomer or of adding
    a party?  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=DA>In <i>Dukoff
        et al. v. Toronto General Hospital et al.</i> </span>(1986), 54 O.R.
        (2d) 58 (H.C.J.), Saunders J. noted the practice, adopted in this case,
        of using fictitious names where the identity of the parties are unknown.  If
        it was a case of misnomer, the statement of claim could be corrected
        by replacing the fictitious name (John Doe in that case) for the correct
        name, even though the correction was sought after expiry of the limitation
        period.  He adopted the following test from <i>Davies v. Elsby Brothers,
        Ltd., </i>[1960] 3 All E.R. 672 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), at p. 676:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The test must
    be:  How would a reasonable person receiving the document take it?  If, in
    all the circumstances of the case and looking at the document as a whole,
    he would say to himself: “Of course it must mean me, but they have got my
    name wrong”. Then there is a case of mere misnomer.  If, on the other hand,
    he would say:  “I cannot tell from the document itself whether they mean
    me or not and I shall have to make inquiries”, then it seems to me that one
    is getting beyond the realm of misnomer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge applied the same test in this case.  She looked at the statement
    of claim and particularly paragraphs 15 and 18, which refer to the surgical
    consult note and the administration of four pints of blood, and concluded
    that as the surgeons involved in the treatment of Mr. Spirito, the appellants
    would have known that their conduct was at issue.  This was primarily a finding
    of fact that is entitled to deference in this court.  I am satisfied that
    it was reasonably open to the motion judge to come to the conclusion that
    she did.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    found this to be a case of misnomer, the motion judge considered whether
    the appellants would be prejudiced by the amendment.  The appellants did
    not make any allegation of prejudice, other than the passage of time.  The
    motion judge noted that the appellants did not allege that they were unaware
    of the claims.  There are other circumstances that strongly suggest no prejudice,
    in particular the fact that Dr. Tin was able to dictate the detailed discharge
    summary on May 19, 2005, some eighteen months after Mr. Spirito’s death.  I
    see no reason to interfere with the motion judge’s decision.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Result
      if the <i>Limitations Act, 2002 </i>Does Apply</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the same result follows should s. 21 apply.  The opening words of
    s. 21(1) are: “if a limitation period in respect of a claim against a person
    has expired”.  The effect of this court’s decision in <i>Kitcher</i> is that
    in a case of misnomer, the limitation period has not expired.  Further, s.
    21(1) only precludes adding a person as a party, but in the case of misnomer
    the person is not being added as a party.  To repeat a portion of the reasons
    in <i>Kitcher</i>: “The appellants’ motion sought to name the defendant correctly <i>not
    to add him as a party</i>.”  Finally, s. 21(2) makes it clear that the prohibition
    against adding a party after expiration of a limitation period in subsection
    (1) does not prevent the correction of a misnaming of a party.  On the facts
    found by the motion judge, this being a case of misnomer, s. 21(1) did not
    preclude the amendment: see <i>Lloyd v. Clark</i>, 2008 ONCA 343.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants submit that the test under s. 21(2) relating to misnomer is narrower
    than the test under the former law.  I can see no basis for that assertion.  The
    leading cases in this province such as <i>Dukoff</i> use the term misnomer
    and in <i>Dukoff</i>, Saunders J. explained that, “A misnomer is a misnaming.”  The
    appellants, however, rely on an excerpt from <i>Recommendations for a New
    Limitations Act:</i> <i>Report of the Limitations Act Consultation Group</i> (Limitations
    Act Consultation Group, 1991) that had recommended enacting a provision very
    similar to s. 21.  In the commentary to the recommendation, the Group wrote,
    at p. 42, “The practice of commencing actions against unnamed defendants
    (e.g. John Doe) should no longer be necessary with the adoption of the discoverability
    principle.”  The appellants submit that the Legislature’s intention was to
    do away with the common law of misnomer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    are two answers to the submission that s. 21 is narrower than the common
    law understanding of misnomer.  First, the Group as part of its recommendation
    would have included a provision similar to s. 21(2) but only for correction
    of “a misdescription of a party”.  Whatever the distinction between misnaming
    and misdescription, it seems to me that by including “misnaming” as well
    as misdescription, the Legislature intended to preserve the established law
    concerning misnomer as described <i>inter alia</i> in <i>Dukoff.</i>  Second,
    the discoverability principle, now codified in s. 5, may be of no assistance
    in cases like this where the applicable limitation period, s. 38(3) of the <i>Trustee
    Act,</i> is preserved by s. 19.  This court has held that the discoverability
    principle does not apply to s. 38(3):  <i>Waschkowski v. Hopkinson Estate</i> (2000),
    47 O.R. (3d) 370 (
