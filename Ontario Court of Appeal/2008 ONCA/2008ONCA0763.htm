    appellant was convicted of three robberies committed over a roughly four
    month span in 2002.  Identity was the sole issue at trial.  The case for
    the crown rested almost entirely on the evidence of two accomplices.  One
    participated in the second robbery and the other participated in the third
    robbery.  Both gave evidence that the appellant had told them about the earlier
    robbery.  There was some evidence capable of providing confirmation of the
    accomplices’ testimony.  That evidence, while significant, was not overwhelming.  It
    was also open to the jury to conclude that there was no possibility of collusion
    between the two accomplices.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    accused appellant advanced a two pronged defence.  First, he and his brother
    testified and denied that the accused had any involvement in the robberies.  They
    offered some explanation for the potentially inculpatory evidence.  There
    were obvious difficulties with the believability of the evidence of both
    witnesses.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second prong of the defence arose out of the identification evidence given
    by the victims of the robbery, particularly the victims of the first and
    second robbery.  Their descriptions of the robber if accurate, excluded the
    possibility that the appellant was the robber.  Four different witnesses
    identified the robber in the first two robberies as a black male.  The appellant
    is white.  The same witnesses also described the robber’s height as somewhere
    between “slightly over 5’2” and 5’ 10”.  The appellant was over 6’ tall.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    crown did not rely on the identification evidence.  The crown made it clear
    to the jury that it could not possibly ask them to convict based on the identification
    evidence.  The defence took the position that the identification was accurate
    and excluded the possibility that the appellant was the robber.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge properly instructed the jury on the principle of reasonable doubt
    in general.  He also on two occasions gave a proper “W.D.” instruction as
    it related to the evidence of the appellant.  The trial judge did not give
    an instruction like that given in <i>R. v. Jack </i>(1992), 70 C.C.C. (3d)
    67 at 108 (Man. C.A.).  That instruction, given in a case where there was
    exculpatory identification evidence, effectively applies the “W.D.”
    instruction to the exculpatory identification evidence.  We think that kind
    of instruction was necessary here.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not say that an instruction like that given in <i>Jack</i> is essential
    whenever there is identification evidence that is potentially exculpatory.  We
    are however satisfied that in the circumstances of this case it was essential.  The
    potentially exculpatory identification evidence came from four different
    witnesses and related to two of the three robberies.  The discrepancies between
    the description of the robber and the appellant’s actual appearance were
    not only significant, they related to obvious and readily discernable characteristics,
    especially skin colour.  It is hard to see how the evidence of four independent
    witnesses identifying the robber as black could not create a doubt where
    the accused was white.  We also note that roughly the same descriptions were
    given by four different people who were involved in two different events.  This
    fact also suggests to us that the potential for reasonable doubt based on
    the exculpatory identification evidence was high in this case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge in dealing with the defence position did not allude to the possibility
    that the jury could have a reasonable doubt based on the exculpatory evidence,
    even if they did not accept the exculpatory identification evidence as accurate.  The
    trial judge, in summarizing the position of the defence, left it solely on
    the basis that the jury should accept that identification evidence as accurate.  This
    is the way it was put to the jury by defence counsel.  However, we think
    the trial judge should have made it clear to the jury that it was required
    to acquit even if it didn’t believe the exculpatory identification evidence
    as long as that evidence left the jury with a reasonable doubt.  He could
    have made that point in his “W.D.”
    instruction or in his review of the position of the defence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    summary we think the trial judge’s instruction failed to relate the meaning
    and application of the reasonable doubt doctrine to the exculpatory identification
    evidence.  That evidence was a crucial part of the defence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
