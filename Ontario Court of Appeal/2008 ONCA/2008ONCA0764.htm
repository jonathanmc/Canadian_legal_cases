    of course cannot be condoned.  If any appellant should perfect in accordance

    for the appellant argues that the
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Summary Conviction Appeal Court judge in effect raised a new ground of appeal
    after the appeal had been argued and while his decision was under reserve.  In
    our view this mischaracterizes what the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Summary Conviction Appeal Court judge did.  He did not raise a new ground
    of appeal.  The ground of appeal was whether the trial judge had properly
    addressed the various delays caused in this proceeding in assessing whether
    there was a breach of section 11(b) of the <i>Charter</i>.  The
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Summary Conviction Appeal Court judge did focus on an issue, the effect of
    the various and sundry motions brought for disclosure and production by the
    appellant, that was not the focus of the crown’s submissions on the appeal.  It
    was however clearly a part of the section 11(b) calculus.  This would be
    known to anyone familiar with the history of these proceedings and the methodology
    involved in the analysis of a section 11(b) claim.  The motion judge was
    entitled to consider the effect of the various motions brought during the
    trial process on the reasonableness of any delay.  We also think he was entitled
    to request that counsel produce to him the relevant material that was before
    the trial judge.  This material should have been produced by counsel without
    any delay.  </p>

    real question is whether the procedure followed by the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Summary Conviction Appeal Court judge caused any prejudice to the appellant
    in his response to the crown’s appeal.  Counsel for the appellant has not
    satisfied us that the conduct of the
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Summary Conviction Appeal Court resulted in any prejudice to him.  He was
    given a full opportunity to address the issues that concerned the
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Summary Conviction Appeal Court judge in the course of his consideration
    of the appeal and he declined to avail himself of that opportunity.  We would
    not grant leave to appeal on this issue.</p>

w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Summary Conviction Appeal Court judge erred in his section 11(b) analysis.  We
    see no merit to that argument.  We are in substantial agreement with the

    would add that the analysis of section 11(b) cannot be exclusively a microanalysis
    of the various periods of time encompassed in the overall trial process.  Judges
    considering section 11(b) claims must also look at the overall process.  In
    this case based on the findings of the trial judge as confirmed by the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Summary Conviction Appeal Court judge, it is abundantly clear that delay
    in the process was an integral part of the defence tactics throughout this
    case.  The defence delaying tactics correctly informed the section 11(b)
    analysis of the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Summary Conviction Appeal Court judge.  We would not grant leave to appeal
