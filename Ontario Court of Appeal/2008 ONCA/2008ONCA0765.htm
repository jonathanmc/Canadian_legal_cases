    appellant was found guilty after trial in Superior Court on one count of &ldquo;blowing
    over&rdquo;
    and one count of impaired driving.&nbsp; The trial judge entered a conviction
    on the &ldquo;blowing over&rdquo; charge and stayed the impaired driving
    charge.&nbsp; He imposed a sentence of 3.5 years and gave some credit for
    the appellant&rsquo;s brief pre-sentence incarceration.&nbsp; </p>

    of the grounds of appeal relates to the impaired driving charge.&nbsp; As
    indicated above, the trial judge stayed that conviction.&nbsp; Counsel agree
    that we need address that ground of appeal only if the appellant is successful
    in setting aside the conviction on the &ldquo;blowing over&rdquo;
    charge.&nbsp; We will address the grounds of appeal relating to that conviction.&nbsp; </p>

    for the appellant advanced several grounds of appeal arising out of the conviction
    on the &ldquo;blowing over&rdquo; charge.&nbsp; He accepts, correctly in
    our view, that unless he can convince the court that the trial judge erred
    in holding that the breathalyzer tests were administered &ldquo;as soon as
    practicable&rdquo; as required by the statute, he cannot succeed in setting
    aside the conviction on that charge.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER1 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    focuses on the interval between when the appellant completed his conversation
    with his lawyer and the completion of the administration of the second of
    the two breathalyzer tests.&nbsp; The total time interval is thirty seven
    minutes.&nbsp; In considering whether that gap should have resulted in a
    finding against the crown on the &ldquo;as soon as practicable&rdquo; issue,
    one bears in mind that the statute requires at least a fifteen minute interval
    between the first and the second sample.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER1 align=left style='text-align:left;

    officers called by the crown explained that by chance another driver was
    at the police station and was required to provide samples of her breath at
    basically the same time as the appellant was returned to the police station.&nbsp; By
    pure chance she went first.&nbsp; This meant that the appellant had to be
    moved back and forth to the cells between the taking of each sample and that
    he had to alternate his turn on the machine with the other driver.&nbsp; This
    obviously took some extra time.&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER1 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    referred us to <i>R. v. Vanderbruggen</i> (2006), 206 C.C.C. (3d) 489 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
            <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).&nbsp; This authority deals with the meaning of the phrase &ldquo;as soon
    as practicable&rdquo; in section 258 (1)(c)(ii) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.&nbsp; We
    emphasize two observations from that judgment.&nbsp; At para. 12, Justice
    Rosenberg says:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Decisions of
    this and other courts indicate that the phrase means nothing more than that
    the tests were taken within a reasonably prompt time under the circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER1 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    para. 14, he observes:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Whether the
    samples were taken as soon as practicable in this case was an issue of fact
    for the trial judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER1 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge addressed the argument that the crown had failed to prove that
    the samples were taken as soon as practicable.&nbsp; He made findings of
    fact and based on those findings concluded that the crown had met its burden
    on that issue.&nbsp; As indicated in <i>Vanderbruggen</i> this was a factual
    issue for the trial judge and we are not satisfied that he made any error
    that should cause us to interfere with that finding.&nbsp; This ground of
    appeal cannot succeed.&nbsp; As acknowledged by counsel if this ground fails
    the conviction appeal must fail.&nbsp; We dismiss the conviction appeal.</p>

    appellant has a lengthy criminal record including thirteen prior convictions
    for drinking and driving related offences.&nbsp; The breathalyzer readings
    were a little over double the allowable limit.&nbsp; We are not convinced
    that the trial judge made any error in principle.&nbsp; He does not appear
    to have accepted the contention that there was any meaningful gap in the
    appellant&rsquo;s record.&nbsp; With respect to the life time driving prohibition,
    we cannot say, again in light of the terrible record, that this imposition
    of a life time prohibition constitutes any error in principle.&nbsp; We note
    that should circumstances change and should the need arise, the appellant
    can apply to the parole board for some variation of this order.&nbsp; </p>
