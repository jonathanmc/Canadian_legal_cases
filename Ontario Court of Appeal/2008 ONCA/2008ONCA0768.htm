  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant and the respondents are parties to a standard form Canadian Construction
    Documents Committee Stipulated Price Contract for the construction of a school.  A
    dispute arose concerning delay in completion of the contract and the respondents
    issued a notice of default and terminated the contract.  The appellant attempted
    to invoke the dispute resolution provisions of the contract providing for
    mediation and arbitration.  The parties initially agreed on a modified form
    of arbitration, namely a “peer review” process.  However, that agreement
    was never carried into effect, it would appear, because of inaction on the
    part of the respondents.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant thereupon commenced the current action naming not only the respondents
    but several other parties and claiming in addition to damages under the agreement
    against the respondents, other damages and relief against the respondents
    not arising under the agreement, general damages against the other parties,
    and aggravated punitive and exemplary damages against all named defendants.  The
    appellant also claimed an interlocutory mandatory order or specific performance
    requiring the respondents to proceed to mediation and the modified form of
    arbitration previously agreed to and an interlocutory injunction restraining
    the respondents from engaging a third party to complete the construction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    proceeding giving rise to this appeal is the appellant’s motion for a mandatory
    order requiring the respondents to proceed with the contractual dispute resolution
    process and an interlocutory injunction restraining them from engaging a
    third-party to complete the construction.  The motions court judge denied
    both remedies.  The appellant appeals to this court only from the denial
    of a mandatory order requiring the respondents to proceed to arbitration. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    see no error on the part of the motions judge that would entitle this court
    to intervene.  The appellant concedes that there is no authority in the <i>Arbitration
    Act,</i> S. O. 1991 for the relief it seeks.  The appellant invokes the <i>Courts
    of Justice Act</i>, ss. 101 and 106.  Those sections confer a broad discretion
    upon the motions judge to grant a mandatory order “where it appears to a
    judge of the court to be just or convenient to do so” (s. 101) and to stay
    a proceedings, “on such terms as are considered just” (s. 106).  It is well-established
    that the risk of multiplicity of proceedings, the avoidance of cost and inconvenience
    and the risk of inconsistent results are factors to be taken into account
    in the exercise of the discretion conferred by these sections. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motions judge assessed the claim being advanced by the appellant in the action.  She
    found that the appellant had claimed relief against the respondents beyond
    the scope of what was identified in the agreement as being arbitrable and
    that involved several other parties who are not contractually bound by the
    arbitration clause.  The motions judge concluded that when the appellant’s
    claim as a whole was considered, to permit arbitration of some claims against
    the respondents and stay the other claims would involve duplication of effort,
    cost and inconvenience, and give rise to the risk inconsistent results.  She
    exercised her discretion and declined to order the respondents to proceed
    to arbitration.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant could have simply sought to invoke and enforce the arbitration
    provisions of the agreement.  However, by bringing this action, the appellant
    defined the parameters of its dispute with the respondents more broadly that
    it could have under arbitration.  The appellant has cast a broad net by commencing
    the action and, in our view, cannot escape the consequences.  Any right the
    appellant may have to arbitrate certain aspects of its dispute with the respondent
    must now be considered in the light of the claim it has advanced in the action. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    dispute as defined by the appellant’s statement of claim involved not only
    claims that might have been arbitrated under the agreement but also other
    claims and other parties that plainly could not be arbitrated.  In these
    circumstances, it was open to the motions judge to conclude that the desirability
    of having all aspects of the appellant’s dispute with the respondents and
    other parties resolved under the umbrella of a single proceeding prevailed
    over the appellant’s claim to have one part of the dispute arbitrated.  We
    see no error of principle that would entitle us to interfere with her assessment
    that hiving off one portion of the dispute for arbitration would not be in
    the interests of justice. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly
    the appeal is dismissed.  Costs to the respondents fixed at $10,000 inclusive
    of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
