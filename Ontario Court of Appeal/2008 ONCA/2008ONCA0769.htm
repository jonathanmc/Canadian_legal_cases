    appellant, who was a Senior Vice-President (SVP) with the respondent, The
    Bank of Nova Scotia, claimed that he was constructively dismissed in the
    early part of 2004.  The appellant’s claim was based on reductions in his
    compensation package between the years 2001 and 2003.  His compensation package
    included a salary, a cash bonus, and various share options.  The cash bonus
    and the share options varied from year to year during the relevant time.  The
    salary remained the same.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found against the appellant.  She provided thorough and careful
    reasons for judgment.  </p>

    on appeal attempts to re-litigate what are factual questions decided at trial,
    albeit with an argument that takes a somewhat different slant than the submissions
    put before the trial judge.  The trial judge correctly observed early in
    her reasons, that the case was fact bound and turned on an application of
    well settled legal principles to the evidence heard by her.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant accepts that the trial judge did not err when she found against
    him on his claim that he was advised in 2000 that he would be on his way
    to Executive Vice-President compensation levels if he took up a newly created
    Senior Vice-President position with the Bank.  The trial judge referred to
    this claim, which she rejected and which counsel does not renew on appeal,
    as the “crux of the claim” advanced at trial.  The appellant also accepts
    that his September 2000 level of compensation did not establish a permanent
    base line for the calculation of his future levels of compensation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s main argument is that in fixing the variable components of his
    overall compensation package for the years 2001 to 2003, the Bank took into
    consideration a factor that was not one of the three criteria that the appellant
    claims could be looked at by the Bank according to the terms of the appellant’s
    employment.  These terms were not reduced to writing but, according to the
    appellant can be inferred from the conduct of the parties.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that the Bank wrongly, and contrary to the terms on which
    his compensation was to be settled, looked to the Bank’s perceived need after
    2000 to bring the appellant’s compensation into line with Senior Vice-President
    levels of compensation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is agreed that the appellant’s compensation went up dramatically in 2000,
    but went down during the three years in issue (2001-3).  There is some disagreement
    as to exactly how much it went down.  In our view, the trial judge’s figure
    of 13% over the three year period is the correct figure.  It is also uncontested
    that throughout this period, the appellant remained among the highest paid
    Senior Vice-Presidents in the Bank.  His performance evaluations were always
    very good.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the appellant’s argument was not put in the same terms as the argument made
    to the trial judge, her factual findings, which are fully supported by the
    evidence, are dispositive of this ground of appeal.  We think it is appropriate
    to set those findings of fact out in the terms in which they appear in the
    trial judge’s reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[94]  In reviewing
    the decreases in Chapman’s compensation over this period, it must be remembered
    that his total compensation was never fixed at a particular number, nor was
    he ever given assurance that it would not fluctuate or go down, nor was he
    told that he would remain at a particular number relative to other SVPs.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[96]  It was
    his variable compensation which fluctuated.  This, by very definition, is
    the nature of variable compensation.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[97] (d)  <i>There
      was no commitment given with respect to MIP [the bonus] which was a significant
      variable component of Chapman’s overall compensation.</i>  It was clear
      that MIP was to be determined by individual performance, within the context
      of the overall MIP pool for any particular year.  The pool itself could
      fluctuate depending on Bank performance and market conditions.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[100]  Further,
    I do not think the fact that Chapman’s compensation went down from 2000-2003
    and the average of the steady state [the comparator group of Senior Vice-Presidents]
    went up supports Chapman’s constructive dismissal claim.  <i>There was no
    commitment that he would remain at a certain level above SVPs or that he
    would stay at any particular point in the SVP range.  It was only necessary
    that he be compensated fairly – which in this case was within the range for
    his position and performance level.  He was.</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[101]  <i>With
      respect to the argument that the Bank was bringing him into line with other
      SVPs, I see nothing wrong with that, as long as Chapman stayed within the
      applicable range for SVPs.</i>  If he had been overpaid in any particular
      year, then absent any agreement that he would not be reduced (which I have
      not found to be the case), it was within the Bank’s right to align him
      with other SVPs.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[104]  While
    I accept that compensation is an essential term of an employment contract,
    the question is what were the terms of Chapman’s employment contract on compensation.  As
    set out above, <i>I do not consider that there was an express or implied
    term that Chapman’s variable compensation would not fluctuate, or that his
    overall compensation would remain at a specific level every year or that
    he would have a specific gap over other SVPs.  Chapman knew that his compensation
    had a variable component and that it would fluctuate from year to year. </i>[Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also makes a second submission.  He argues that the overall reduction
    in his compensation (13%) was so significant as to constitute a substantial
    change in the terms of his employment resulting in a fundamental breach of
    his employment contract and constituting a constructive dismissal.  The trial
    judge examined this submission at length and rejected it.  She found that
    the reductions in the appellant’s compensation in 2001 and 2002 were condoned
    by the appellant.  In both years, he successfully renegotiated aspects of
    his compensation package when he was dissatisfied with that package as initially
    presented to him.  She found that the reduction in 2003 (3.7%) was minimal
    and not enough to amount to a constructive dismissal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the course of addressing this argument, the trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[124]  What
    would a reasonable person have thought when Chapman’s compensation was decreased
    in 2003?  Given the factors outlined in paragraph 97 and 113 above, <i>I
    cannot say that the change from 2002, nor the overall reduction from 2000,
    could have been regarded as a fundamental breach of the employment contract
    entitling Chapman to treat it as repudiated.  There was no change of the
    agreed basis upon which he was to be compensated as an SVP, nor was there
    any change in his employment responsibilities, title or working relationship
    with the Bank</i>.  Chapman was not making as much as he did in the banner
    year of 2000 and had declined to a level that was within the SVP range.  That
    is not sufficient, in my view, to establish a constructive dismissal. [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    with the earlier findings, we see no basis upon which to interfere with this
    essentially factual assessment.  The trial judge made no material factual
    error.  Her analysis and her conclusion are both reasonable.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    light of our disposition of these two arguments, it is unnecessary to hear
    submissions on the mitigation issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
