line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    plaintiffs (appellants) sought leave to amend their statement of claim to
    add new parties.  They sought to allege a breach of fiduciary duty and negligence
    against the respondent law firm and an individual former partner in that
    law firm who unfortunately has since died.  The claim arose out of an agreement
    by the appellants to sell certain shares to the respondents.  The appellants
    contended that they were not paid the promised purchase price and this gave
    rise to the initial law suit.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent lawyer acted for the purchaser of the shares.  That corporation,
    now a defendant, purchased the shares from the appellants in July 2005.  He
    was also the corporate solicitor of the company whose shares were being sold.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents resisted the amendment on the basis that the claims the appellants
    proposed to make against them as pleaded in the draft amended statement of
    claim were barred by the two year limitation period set out in the <i>Limitations
    Act, 2002 </i>(the Act).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to counsel for the appellants’ submissions, we do not think that
    either ss. 14 or 15 of the Act are engaged in this case.  In our view, the
    amendment motion turned on the application of s. 5 of the Act to the claims
    against the respondents as articulated in the proposed amended statement
    of claim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge reviewed the material filed before him on the motion.  The material
    included the affidavit of the wife of the appellant, Mr. Hughes, and the
    affidavit of a lawyer in the firm of counsel who acts in these proceedings
    for the appellants.  After reviewing the material, the motion judge stated: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>If it was necessary
    that the plaintiffs obtain legal advice before appreciating that they had
    a potential claim as against Mr. MacColl, the evidence is that they did obtain
    counsel prior to the expiration of the limitation period.  <i>The affidavit
    material is silent as to when that counsel was engaged.  One must also be
    mindful that section 5 requires the exercise of reasonable diligence on the
    part of a claimant to become aware of the fact of a loss, the identity of
    the person who caused it, and the appropriateness of a legal proceeding to
    remedy the perceived wrong</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The evidentiary
    record before me indicates that a lawyer was contacted in November, 2006.  <i>There
    is no explanation as to why a lawyer was not contacted between the date the
    plaintiffs became aware of the non-payment owning under the share purchase
    agreement, July 31,2005, and that November, 2006 unspecified date when counsel
    was consulted</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge obviously placed some importance on the absence of any affidavit
    from Mr. Hughes in respect of what he did or did not know about any claim
    he might have against the respondents, and the absence of any evidence as
    to when counsel was consulted.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>On the evidence
    before me, I am satisfied that the identity of the proposed defendants, Mr.
    MacColl and his law firm, and the facts surrounding Mr. MacColl’s involvement
    were all known to the plaintiffs in July, 2005.  The fact that the contract
    drafted by Mr. MacColl was breached by reason of non-payment by the defendants
    became known to the plaintiffs at the end of July, 2005.  The fact that Mr.
    MacColl acted only for the defendants and not the plaintiffs and the fact
    that he did not recommend or insist on independent legal advice was known
    to the plaintiffs in July, 2005, <i>and due diligence would have led them
    to seek legal advice as to any potential liability arising from those alleged
    shortcomings within a time frame well within the limitation period</i>. [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this court, the argument focused on whether the appellants, by the exercise
    of due diligence, should have obtained by November 2005 (two years before
    the claim was issued) legal advice such as to put them on notice that a proceeding
    against the respondents would be an appropriate course of action: see s.
    5(1)(a)(iv) of the Act.  As indicated above, Mr. Hughes, who presumably was
    in the best position to provide the relevant information, did not file any
    affidavit.  Neither the affidavit of the wife nor the affidavit of the lawyer
    speak to this factual question.  Section 5(2) creates a presumption that
    in these circumstances operates against the appellants’
    position:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>5.  (2)  A person
    with a claim shall be presumed to have known of the matters referred to in
    clause (1) (a) on the day the act or omission on which the claim is based
    took place, unless the contrary is proved.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    regard to the presumption in the Act and the absence of any evidence from
    the appellants directed specifically to the factual questions arising out
    of the due diligence issue, we see no basis upon which we should interfere
    with the decision of the motion judge.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal is dismissed.  Costs to the respondents in the amount of $10,000,
    inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>
