style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants commenced an action against the respondent (the Province) on behalf
    of themselves and others who have applied for benefits under the Ontario
    Disability Support Program (“ODSP”).  The proceeding was commenced under
    the <i>Class Proceedings Act, 1992</i>, S.O. 1992, c. 6.  In their statement
    of claim, the appellants advanced a wide variety of claims.  All the claims
    rested on the assertions that the procedures used to process, evaluate and
    adjudicate claims for ODSP benefits were inefficient, irrational, unnecessarily
    time-consuming, inaccessible, and demeaned those who applied for the benefits.  The
    appellants contended that the many failings in the process gave rise to several
    causes of action, including negligence, breach of fiduciary duty, and violations
    of ss. 7 and 15 of the <i>Charter</i>.  The appellants sought both damages
    and declaratory relief in respect of the alleged <i>Charter</i> violations.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Province, after filing a statement of defence and before any further steps
    were taken under the <i>Class Proceedings Act,</i> moved for an order striking
    the statement of claim as disclosing no reasonable cause of action.  The
    motion judge struck the statement of claim.  He granted leave to amend, but
    only as it related to declaratory relief based on the allegation that the
    failure to give reasons for the initial refusal of benefit claims constituted
    a violation of s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>: see <i>Wareham v. Ontario (Minister
    of Community and Social Services)</i> (2008), 166 C.R.R. (2d) 162.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants appealed, arguing that the motion judge should have allowed the
    claims based on negligence, and breaches of ss. 7 and 15 of the <i>Charter</i> to
    proceed to trial.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    am in substantial agreement with the analysis of the motion judge and his
    order striking the entire statement of claim.  However, I would not restrict
    leave to amend the s. 7 claim to a breach based exclusively on the failure
    to give reasons for the denial of benefit claims.  I would grant leave to
    amend permitting the appellants to advance a claim for a declaration of a
    s. 7 <i>Charter </i>breach<i> </i>based on the Province’s failure to provide
    a process for the determination of benefit entitlement that complies with
    the <i>Charter </i>requirements of procedural fairness.  </p>

line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants limited their submissions on appeal to the negligence claim, and
    the ss. 7 and 15 <i>Charter </i>claims.  The other causes of action asserted
    in the statement of claim and struck by the motion judge are no longer in
    issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    will not re-plough the ground so effectively worked by the motion judge.  He
    identified the relevant principles applicable on a motion to strike a pleading:
    see para. 11.  He properly analyzed the negligence claim and explained why
    there was no reasonable cause of action pleaded by the appellants in negligence:
    see paras. 15-28.  The motion judge also properly analyzed and rejected the
    s. 15 claims: see paras. 59-72.  I see no value in any further analysis of
    those claims.  </p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>III.       The

    appellants sought both damages and declaratory relief for the alleged breach
    of s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>.  At para. 73, the motion judge held that the
    damages claim could not possibly succeed.  I agree with his reasons.  The
    remainder of my analysis assumes that the only remedy available to the appellants
    for a breach of s. 7 is a declaration. </p>

    <i>Ontario</i><i> Disability Support Program Act 1997</i>, S.O. 1997, c.
    25, Schedule B (“<i>ODSPA</i>”).  Eligibility is based on financial need
    combined with disability.  The two named plaintiffs allege that they are
    single mothers who suffer from severe physical and emotional health disabilities.  They
    are unable to support themselves through gainful employment.  Both applied
    for and eventually received ODSP benefits.  However, both allege that they
    spent many months without those benefits as their claims were processed.  The
    named plaintiffs allege that the lengthy and unnecessary delays in the processing
    of their claims had a significant negative impact on their mental and physical
    well-being.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    ODSP application process is referred to in paragraphs 36-40 of the statement
    of claim.  Paragraph 37 alleges that the administrative procedures are “inefficient
    and unnecessarily complicated and deprive applicants of timely determinations
    on their applications.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Paragraph
    38 asserts that those same procedures “serve no proper purpose, create undue

    entitlement to ODSP benefits on the merits.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Paragraph
    39 provides one example of an alleged artificial barrier imposed by the process
    and paragraph 40 asserts that the majority of applicants experience a delay
    of between six months to one year before receiving an initial response to
    their application for benefits.  Apart from the single reference in paragraph
    39, and a later reference to the failure to give reasons, the statement of
    claim does not identify any specific features of the administrative procedures
    to support the conclusory assertions made in paragraphs 36-40.</p>

line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    s. 7 claim is also addressed in paragraphs 62-67 of the statement of claim.  As
    with the earlier part of the statement of claim, the allegations are entirely
    conclusory.  The appellants assert that the government has created and maintained
    an inaccessible, time-consuming and inefficient application process that
    humiliates those applying for benefits and harms their physical and mental
    health.  The appellants further assert that the process violates their right
    to
    “essential human dignity”.  Finally the appellants contend that the process
    contradicts the very purpose for which the <i>ODSPA</i> was created. </p>

    66 and 67 of the claim specifically address the failure to give reasons for
    the initial denial of benefits.  Paragraph 67 asserts that the failure to
    provide reasons has deprived the appellants of “the ability to know the case
    against them and thus has infringed a principle of fundamental justice.”</p>

line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(ii)      The
      reasons of the motion judge</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge, following well-established authority, approached the adequacy
    of the s. 7 claim in two stages.  First, he asked whether the appellants
    had pleaded a deprivation of security of the person caused by state action.  Second,
    he considered whether the appellants had pleaded that the deprivation was
    contrary to a recognized principle of fundamental justice.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    considering the first stage of the s. 7 analysis, the motion judge correctly
    observed that the appellants challenged the procedures used to process claims
    for benefits and not the criteria used to decide entitlement or the level
    of entitlement.  At para. 46, the motion judge stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I do not think
    it is plain and obvious that, if delays in the administrative and adjudicative
    process for determining eligibility for statutory welfare benefits caused
    serious harm to the plaintiffs, their rights to security of the person were
    not engaged.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the motion judge that the appellants successfully cleared the
    first of the two s. 7 hurdles.  There is a potential argument to be made
    that delay in processing applications for welfare benefits, essential for
    day-to-day existence and to which the applicants are statutorily entitled,
    could engage the right to security of the person where that delay has caused
    serious physical or psychological harm.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Next,
    the motion judge turned to the second stage of the s. 7 analysis.  Even where
    state action causes a deprivation of security of the person, it breaches
    s. 7 only if the deprivation is not in accordance with the principles of
    fundamental justice.   The motion judge identified three features as essential
    components of a principle of fundamental justice.  First, it must be a legal
    principle.  Second, it must be widely accepted as an integral part of the
    due administration of justice.  Third, the principle must be capable of being
    identified with sufficient precision to yield a manageable standard against
    which to measure the state conduct in issue.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge held that the appellants had not identified any principle of
    fundamental justice in their pleadings.  At para. 53, he stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In my opinion,
    none of the three requirements is satisfied by the pleading in this case.  <i>It
    is not, I believe, a principle of fundamental justice that, if the legislature
    chooses to establish a program for providing welfare, or other benefits,
    it must achieve a certain standard of efficiency.</i>  Insofar as the alleged
    delays are attributed to deficiencies and inadequacies in the process established
    under the <i>ODSPA</i>, the pleading does not, in my judgment, either expressly
    or impliedly, engage any principle of fundamental justice. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge went on to strike the entirety of the appellants’ broadly based
    s. 7 claim.  However, he concluded that s. 7 could support a narrower claim
    for declaratory relief.  At para. 56, he observed that the relevant regulations
    imposed a duty to give reasons for the initial denial of benefits.  Further,
    he noted that the failure to comply with that obligation could delay the
    reconsideration of the initial refusal and ultimately the determination in
    favour of granting benefits.  The motion judge was satisfied that the duty
    to give reasons imposed by the regulation was “sufficiently related to the
    rules of natural justice to be considered to be principles of fundamental
    justice.”  Therefore, he held that a properly pleaded claim alleging a breach
    of s. 7 on the basis of the failure to give the requisite reasons could possibly
    succeed, and he granted leave to amend on that basis.  </p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(iii)     Analysis</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, leave to amend the s. 7 claim should not be limited to a claim based
    on the failure to give reasons. The motion judge characterized the s. 7 claim
    based on the failure to give reasons as a claim of procedural unfairness,
    as evidenced by his reference to the rules of natural justice.  I agree with
    this characterization.  However, I see no reason why a properly pleaded s.
    7 claim could not encompass alleged procedural deficiencies other than the
    failure to give reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    considering the second stage of the s. 7 analysis, the motion judge treated
    the claim, apart from the failure to give reasons, as a challenge to the
    substance of the benefits scheme.  The motion judge searched for an operative
    principle of fundamental justice in the pleadings using the approach set
    out in cases like <i>Chaoulli v. Quebec (Attorney General)</i>, [2005] 1
    S.C.R. 791, and <i>R. v. Malmo-Levine</i>, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 571.  These cases
    examined the constitutionality of legislative schemes or criminal prohibitions
    where it was alleged that the substance of the scheme or prohibition contravened
    the principles of fundamental justice.  I do not think that the approach
    taken to defining the principles of fundamental justice in that context is
    appropriate for claims based on procedural unfairness, where the inquiry
    focuses on the fairness of the procedures followed in arriving at a decision
    rather than the fundamental justice of the law or other state action.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not criticize the motion judge for examining the s. 7 claim as he did.  Given
    the inadequacies in the pleadings, it is very difficult to discern the exact
    nature of the appellants’ s. 7 claim, apart from the aspect of the claim
    relating to the failure to give reasons.  Certainly the claim as drafted
    could be read as advancing in part at least an allegation of substantive

    this stage, however, the issue is not whether the appellants properly pleaded
    procedural unfairness beyond the failure to give reasons.  The motion judge
    has given the appellants a further opportunity to properly plead a s. 7 claim.  The
    Province has not cross-appealed from that part of the order.  The issue is
    whether leave to amend the pleading should be extended to allegations of
    procedural unfairness beyond the failure to give reasons.</p>

    is beyond doubt that the principles of fundamental justice include the right

      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)</i>, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 3, the court
    said at para. 113:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The principles
    of fundamental justice of which s. 7 speaks, though not identical to the
    duty of fairness elucidated in <i>Baker</i>, are the same principles underlying
    that duty.  As Professor Hogg has said, “The common law rules [of procedural
    fairness] are in fact basic tenets of the legal system, and they have evolved
    in response to the same values and objectives as s. 7.”  In <i>Singh v. Minister
    of Employment and Immigration</i>, Wilson J. recognized that the principles
    of fundamental justice demand, at a minimum, compliance with the common law
    requirements of procedural fairness.  Section 7 protects substantive as well
    as procedural rights: <i>Re</i> <i>B.C. Motor Vehicle Act</i>.  Insofar as
    procedural rights are concerned, the common law doctrine summarized in <i>Baker</i>,
    properly recognizes the ingredients of fundamental justice. [Citations omitted.]</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[Section] 7
    also includes a requirement of procedural fairness.  This requirement attaches
    only where a decision-maker has a power of decision over life, liberty or
    security of the person.  <i>Where this is so, s. 7 will impose rules of procedural
    fairness on the decision-maker.  Those rules are probably the same as those
    that would be required by the common law</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>

    content of the duty of fairness in any given circumstance, and hence the
    requirements of the principles of fundamental justice, will vary depending
    on the context.  That context includes the statutory scheme in issue, the
    procedural protections, if any, provided in the scheme, the nature of the
    decision in issue, the importance of the decision to the individual affected
    by it, and the legitimate expectations of the persons affected by the decision:

    this case, I am satisfied that a s. 7 claim based on procedural fairness
    could go beyond the failure to give reasons.  Just as the failure to give
    reasons may render a process constitutionally unfair, other aspects of that
    process that unreasonably hinder, delay or deny access to benefits to which
    persons are statutorily entitled may be so procedurally unfair as to contravene
    s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>.  </p>

    Sossin sets out in careful detail the process used to determine eligibility
    for ODSP benefits, beginning with the initial intake telephone call and proceeding
    through various stages to the ultimate determination of eligibility.  He
    presents this process as a case study in “bureaucratic disentitlement”.  The
    phenomenon of “bureaucratic disentitlement” is defined at p. 399 as “a series
    of structural and situational features of the welfare eligibility process
    which together have the effect of discouraging applicants and demoralizing
    recipients.”  Professor Sossin contends that applicants for benefits, many
    of whom are seriously disadvantaged and vulnerable, face difficulties and
    unnecessary barriers to an expeditious and fair determination of their claim
    on its merits.  He strongly argues that the process at the least demeans
    and dehumanizes many who need the benefits and in some situations causes
    those who are entitled to the benefits to simply give up trying to get them.</p>

    Sossin advances several potential avenues of redress open to those who are
    victims of “bureaucratic disentitlement”.  Among those avenues, he identifies
    a s. 7 claim based on the state’s failure to meet constitutional standards
    of procedural fairness in the methods used to process the benefit applications:

    am in no position to comment on the correctness of Professor Sossin’s description
    of the process, his criticisms of that process, or on any differences that
    may exist between the current process and the one described by him.  I refer
    to his article because it demonstrates to me that there is sufficient potential
    to a procedural due process claim to justify extending leave to amend beyond
    the failure to give reasons to include other aspects of that process considered
    both individually and cumulatively.</p>
