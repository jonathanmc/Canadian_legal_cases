    appellant Darin Schwemler appeals from the judgment of Smith J. dismissing
    his application for a declaration under s. 4 of the <i>Children’s Law Reform
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.12 that he be recognized as the father of a child,
    Madison Ralph, and also dismissing his application for access to the child.  There
    were two respondents to the application, Luc Ralph, who brought a cross-application
    seeking a declaration that he was the child’s father, and Margaret McBain,
    the child’s mother.  Ralph’s cross-application was also dismissed.</p>

line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant raises three grounds of appeal.  He submits that the trial judge
    erred in excluding evidence of a conversation between a worker with the Children’s
    Aid Society and the mother on the basis of privilege.  Second, that he erred
    in failing to draw an adverse inference from the mother’s refusal to permit
    DNA testing of the child.  Third, that the judge’s reasons were inadequate,
    especially in failing to articulate why the appellant was disbelieved.</p>

    child involved in this case, Madison Ralph, was born December 11, 2004.  Thus,
    the important period for determining paternity was March 2004.  Both the
    appellant and Mr. Ralph claim to have had sexual relations with Ms. McBain
    at that time.  McBain, who pinpointed the date of conception at March 20,
    2004, testified that she was only involved sexually with Ralph at that time,
    having ended her relationship with the appellant on February 20, 2004.  </p>

    February and March 2004, the appellant and McBain lived in separate townhouses
    in a complex on Second Line West in Sault Ste. Marie.  When the appellant
    first moved into the complex he was living with Pam Ralph, the spouse of
    the respondent Luc Ralph.  Living with the appellant and Ms. Ralph were three
    children all bearing the last name Ralph.  However, the appellant was the
    biological father of two of the children.  The respondent Luc Ralph was the
    biological father of the third child.  </p>

    Ralph introduced the appellant to Ms. McBain when they moved into the complex
    in the fall of 2003.  By February 2004, the appellant had become interested
    in having a romantic relationship with Ms. McBain.  Ms. McBain did not want
    to have such a relationship as long as the appellant was still with Pam Ralph.  In
    the appellant’s words, he “granted that request” and had Ms. Ralph move out.  The
    appellant retained custody of the three children.  He began his sexual relationship
    with Ms. McBain on February 9, 2004.  </p>

    February and March the appellant and McBain maintained their separate residences,
    although the appellant and his three children would often stay over at the
    McBain residence with Ms. McBain and her four children.  The appellant testified
    that he had sexual relations with McBain from February 9 until early July
    when he broke off the relationship because of an argument over use of a computer.  As
    far as he knew, no one else was having sexual relations with McBain during
    this time.  He testified that they were constantly together, and even when
    they were in their separate residences he had a clear view into her townhouse
    from his residence.</p>

    McBain testified that she ended the relationship with the appellant on February
    20, 2004 after an argument at a bar.  She claimed that the appellant assaulted
    her because she refused to give him money so he could continue to drink.  The
    appellant acknowledged that there was some sort of dispute on that date but
    denied assaulting McBain.  He claimed that this was merely one of a number
    of arguments that he had with McBain.  These arguments usually resolved themselves
    within a day, and the sexual relationship would then resume.  Ms. McBain
    conceded that she continued to see the appellant almost daily over the next
    few months.</p>

    Ralph and Ms. McBain had known each other since 1994.  Ms. McBain testified
    that she first had sexual relations with Ralph in February 2002 and continued
    to have occasional relations with him in the following years, including the
    time when she was having sexual relations with the appellant.  She testified
    that after she ended her relationship with the appellant she was only having
    relations with Ralph.  </p>

    Ralph testified that he was the father of two children with Pam Ralph.  He
    had been charged with assaulting one of those children.  He also had a lengthy
    criminal record for other offences, including offences of dishonesty.  In
    2003, when he was not in jail, he had a relationship with another woman with
    whom he has two other children.  </p>

    Ms. McBain, Mr. Ralph testified that they began having sexual relations in
    February 2002 and that this continued intermittently into 2004.  Ralph testified
    that McBain told him that he was the father of one of her other children,
    a boy born in October 2002.  From February 2004 to July 2004 they had sexual
    relations more often.  Ms. McBain told Ralph that she had ended her relationship
    with the appellant in February.  He and the three children who were in his
    custody moved in with Ms. McBain and her four children in July 2004.  Neither
    he nor McBain were using contraceptive measures.  McBain and Ralph were still
    together at the time of the trial in November 2006 and were discussing marriage.</p>

    McBain testified that she first learned she was pregnant on April 21, 2004
    when she went to a gynaecologist, Dr. Amimi, for a tubal ligation.  Before
    performing the procedure the physician did a pregnancy test and it was positive.  She
    denied doing a home pregnancy test before then.  She told Dr. Amimi that
    the father was “unknown”.  Although neither she nor Ralph was using any kind
    of contraceptive measures, she was surprised by the results of the test.  She
    explained that she was surprised because she had not become pregnant in the
    previous two years even though she was having unprotected sex during this
    period.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant had a different version.  He initially testified that Ms. McBain
    had used a home pregnancy test and that it came back negative.  He later
    testified that the results were ambiguous or possibly positive.  McBain then
    went to see Dr. Amimi.  Dr. Amimi later telephoned the house and spoke to
    McBain’s sister and gave her the results of the test.  The sister then told
    the appellant, who was present when the call came in.  When McBain returned
    home, the appellant told her the results of the test and she said, “Oh, okay.”  According
    to the appellant, McBain was trying to get pregnant.  On the other hand,
    he also testified that he was aware that Ms. McBain had discussed “getting
    her tubes tied” but he did not think that was why Ms. McBain went to see
    Dr. Amimi.</p>

line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According
    to the appellant, thereafter until they broke up, McBain told a number of
    people that he was the father of the child.  After he broke up with McBain,
    they remained friendly until he started a relationship with another woman.  At
    that point, McBain told him he was not going to have access to his daughter.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>McBain
    testified that she was aware that after they broke up, the appellant was
    telling people that he was the father of the child.  She initially testified
    that she did not confront the appellant about these statements since she
    did not want to have anything to do with him.  The trial judge then interjected
    and reminded Ms. McBain of her evidence that she had continued to see the
    appellant after February 2004.  She then said that she did tell the appellant
    not to say he was the father of the child.  The trial judge then asked Ms.
    McBain if she knew what the word “truth” was.</p>

    assigned to them.  The appellant and Ralph were clients of Renee Jefferson.  The
    appellant testified that at first Ms. McBain hid the pregnancy from the CAS
    because she was afraid she would lose custody of her children because she
    was having another child.  However, rumours were going around that McBain
    was pregnant and in April Ms.&nbsp;Jefferson confronted McBain about the
    rumours.  McBain apparently admitted that she was pregnant and that the appellant

    was not present at the time.  Thereafter she attended the appellant’s home
    on several occasions when Ms.&nbsp;McBain was present.  Ms. Jefferson testified
    that the appellant told her on several occasions that he was the father of
    the child.  Ms. McBain was present some of these times and never denied that
    the appellant was the father.  These conversations continued at least into
    May or June 2004.  </p>

    Barrett was the child protection worker for Ms. McBain.  Counsel for the

    had previously obtained an order, apparently on consent, requiring that Ms.
    Barrett provide an affidavit to the appellant “setting out information of
    which she and the Society may be aware related to the issue of paternity
    of the child Madison Ralph”.  Counsel for Ms.&nbsp;McBain objected to Ms.

    the order requiring production of this information was filed at the trial,
    appellant’s counsel did not indicate what information had been provided.  The
    only reference to her potential evidence was in cross-examination of Ms.
    McBain.  Counsel for the appellant suggested to McBain that she told Ms.
    Barrett on May 4 that she was pregnant with the appellant’s child.  Ms. McBain
    denied telling Ms. Barrett that the appellant was the father of her child.  </p>

      as May.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><b>The engagement
      ring:  </b>At trial, the appellant testified that he gave Ms. McBain a
      ring as a sign of his commitment to her, but denied that he intended to
      marry her.  In one affidavit, the appellant referred to the ring as an
      engagement ring which she wore on her “engagement finger”.  He also stated
      that they had intended to marry in March 2004.  When confronted with the
      affidavit, the appellant testified that they had discussed marriage.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><b>The pregnancy
      test:  </b>At trial, the appellant gave several different versions of the
      results of the home pregnancy test.  He first said it was negative, then
      said it was unclear and then said it appeared positive.  In one of his
      affidavits, he stated that it was “like positive”.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><b>Whether McBain
      wanted to get pregnant:</b>  The appellant testified that Ms. McBain wanted
      to get pregnant and have a child with him.  He agreed that in one of his
      affidavits he stated that in “May 2005” McBain said that she had changed
      her mind and did not want to have a baby.  He testified that the affidavit
      was mistaken and that the conversation was in March.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant admitted that he had read over his affidavits and there were a
    few mistakes in them but that “you… can’t always correct them all that you
    see”.  The trial judge interjected to point out that these were “pretty vital”
    mistakes.  The appellant agreed.  Later, the trial judge asked the appellant
    if he had sworn on the Bible when he signed his affidavits.  He said that
    he was not given a Bible and no one asked him to swear that the contents
    were true.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    were other problems with the appellant’s evidence.  He testified that he
    and Ms. McBain were “constantly together” and that no one else was having
    sexual relations with her during their relationship.  He testified that they
    were apart only for a night or two as a result of arguments.  In one of his
    affidavits he stated that they were not even apart for a few waking hours.  However,
    he conceded in cross-examination that there were a number of occasions when
    they were not with each other.  He agreed that Ms.&nbsp;McBain would have
    had an opportunity to have sexual relations with other men at those times.  He
    was also aware that she had had sexual relations with Luc Ralph on at least
    one occasion before their relationship.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant initially testified:  “I don’t drink.”  He later conceded that
    he does drink and specifically was drinking on February 20, the date Ms.
    McBain put as the end of the relationship.</p>

    trial judge briefly reviewed the evidence, particularly the evidence about
    the various relationships.  He then referred to Ms. Jefferson’s evidence
    that Ms. McBain did not deny the appellant’s claim that he was the father
    of the child during the pregnancy.  The trial judge did not attribute any
    probative value to this evidence:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>This lack of
    comment would ordinarily work to the detriment of the validity of an eventual
    denial by McBain.  But McBain’s demonstrated fluid attitude and position
    as to the fathering of children born to her takes her silence on this occasion
    out of ordinary circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge also dealt with Ms. McBain’s refusal to have the DNA testing
    done.  The trial judge drew the following inference from this refusal:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Bearing in mind
    the nonchalant attitude of Margaret McBain as to the fathering of her children,
    the inference I draw is that she does not know for certain who the father
    of Madison is and does not want to know.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    on the question of paternity, the trial judge stated that he could draw no
    conclusion as to who the father was.  He said this:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In the end,
    it would be purely guesswork on my part to fix paternity. <i>The strength
    of the evidence on both sides is equally suspect</i>; the totality of it
    cannot be used to tip the scales to either side. Under these circumstances,
    where credibility of the parties is so wanting, no adverse inference available
    to me can supply the answer. The evidence is contradictory in every vital
    respect. <i>None of the parties is sufficiently reliable as to support either
    the Applicant or the Cross-Applicant's position to the evidentiary extent
    required</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Specifically,
    in order to have any confidence in a ruling to support either claimant, I
    would have to be able to make some finding as to which of the applicants
    was the more likely sexual partner of the mother in the March, 2004 effective
    period. <i>I find myself unable to do that because of the unreliability of
    the evidence on both sides</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>

    appellant submits that the trial judge erred in finding that the communications
    between Ms. McBain and her child protection worker were privileged.  In my
    view, it is not necessary to resolve this issue and, given that neither Ms.
    McBain nor the Children’s Aid Society appeared at this appeal, I am reluctant
    to do so.  It is unnecessary to resolve the issue because the appellant has
    not shown that if there were an error, it would have affected the verdict.  There
    was already evidence before the trial judge from Ms.&nbsp;Jefferson of implied
    admissions.  The trial judge was unwilling to accord those admissions any
    weight because of Ms. McBain’s
    “demonstrated fluid attitude and position as to the fathering of children”.  For
    the same reason, it is highly unlikely that the trial judge would have accorded
    any greater weight to admissions Ms. McBain may have made to Ms.&nbsp;Barrett.  Further,
    there is almost nothing in the record to show the nature of any admissions
    allegedly made to Ms. Barrett, other than Ms. McBain’s denial that she told
    Ms. Barrett that the appellant was the father.</p>

    10(4) of the <i>Children’s Law Reform Act</i> provides that if a person named
    in an order giving leave to do DNA testing refuses to submit to the test, “the
    court may draw such inferences as it thinks appropriate”.  The appellant
    submits that in the circumstances the trial judge was required to draw an
    adverse inference against Ms.&nbsp;McBain’s assertion that Ralph was the
    father of the child because of her refusal to permit the DNA testing of the
    child.  In my view, there is no merit to this ground of appeal.  Section
    10(4) does not dictate the nature of the inference to be drawn from the refusal
    to undergo the testing.  It was for the trial judge to determine as a matter
    of fact what inference should be drawn.  The trial judge explained why he
    drew the inference that he did.  Given the record before him, the inference
    was a reasonable one.</p>

    appellant submits that the trial judge’s reasons were inadequate and in particular
    were deficient because the trial judge did not explain why he rejected the
    appellant’s evidence.  Counsel for the appellant submits that the appellant “cannot
    know from the reasons or comments during the trial why his credibility is
    suspect”.  I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the Supreme Court of Canada has held repeatedly, failure to give adequate
    reasons is not a free standing basis for an appeal:  see, for example, <i>F.H.
    v. McDougall,</i> 2008 SCC 53, at para. 99.  While one purpose of reasons
    is to allow for proper appellate review, if the appellate court can nevertheless
    discern the basis for the trial judge’s conclusion then the submission that
    the reasons are inadequate will fail.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R.
      v. Sheppard</i>, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 869, at para. 55, Binnie J. explained,
      in the context of a criminal case, that an accused should not be left in
      doubt about why a conviction has been entered and reasons for judgment
      may be important to clarify the basis for the conviction.  However, he
      also held that the basis for the conviction may be clear from the record.  Similarly,
      I accept that in this case the appellant should not be left in doubt about
      why his application was dismissed.  However, I am also satisfied that it
      is apparent from the record why the application was dismissed.  The trial
      judge expressly stated that he found the evidence of all the parties, which
      would include the appellant, unreliable.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    one reviews the record, the reasons for finding the appellant’s evidence
    unreliable are apparent.  First, his trial testimony on important issues
    was inconsistent with statements in his affidavits.  I have outlined these
    inconsistencies above in paragraph 23.  The trial judge expressed on the
    record dissatisfaction with the appellant’s credibility when he pointed out
    that these inconsistencies were on vital matters and asked the appellant
    if he had sworn to tell the truth when making his affidavits.  The appellant
    could not have been surprised that the trial judge did not accept his evidence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    were other problems with the appellant’s evidence, including his inconsistent
    evidence as to whether he drank and his assertion that he and McBain were
    constantly together.  These were not minor issues.  His drinking and his
    demand for more money from McBain to continue drinking the night of February
    20 led, according to McBain, to the physical altercation which precipitated
    the end of sexual relations.  His exaggerated assertion that he and Ms. McBain
    were constantly together was an obvious attempt to demonstrate that there
    was no opportunity for McBain and Ralph to have had sexual relations.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the appellant’s testimony was inherently improbable in at least two important
    respects.  He claimed that Ms. McBain was trying to get pregnant.  However,
    he later admitted that she hid the pregnancy from the CAS because she was
    afraid she would lose her other children.  It seems unlikely that Ms. McBain
    would be seeking to get pregnant if she was worried about losing her other
    children. Moreover, the appellant’s claim that the CAS found out about the
    pregnancy when Ms. Jefferies confronted McBain about the rumours was itself
    contradicted by Ms. Jefferies’ evidence that she found out about the pregnancy
    when the appellant told her about it in the absence of Ms. McBain.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    as part of the claim that Ms. McBain was trying to get pregnant, the appellant
    testified that Ms. McBain did a home pregnancy test; yet he gave wholly inconsistent
    answers about the test, claiming it was negative, then unclear and then apparently
    positive.  It is in fact more likely that Ms. McBain found out about the
    pregnancy when she went to see Dr. Amimi about having a tubal ligation.  That
    Ms.&nbsp;McBain wanted a tubal ligation also seems more consistent with her
    concern about the CAS and losing her children.  Even the appellant acknowledged
    that Ms. McBain had discussed having a tubal ligation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    conclude, the unreliability of the evidence of the appellant, Ralph and Ms.&nbsp;McBain
    is obvious from the transcript.  Even without the advantage enjoyed by the
    trial judge of having seen and heard the witnesses, there is no mystery as
    to why the trial judge dismissed the application and the cross-application.  The
    appellant’s evidence was inconsistent in numerous respects.  Ms. McBain’s
    evidence was likewise inconsistent in important areas.  Finally, Mr. Ralph
    was an unreliable witness.  He had a lengthy criminal record for crimes of
    dishonesty and his testimony as to how he found out he was the father of
    the child is at least peculiar.</p>
