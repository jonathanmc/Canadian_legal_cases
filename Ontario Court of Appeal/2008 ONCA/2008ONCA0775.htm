    is a motion brought by the Canadian Civil Liberties Association (CCLA) seeking
    to intervene in this appeal and cross-appeal, scheduled for hearing on November
    17 and 18, 2008. On November 6, 2008, I dismissed the motion and indicated
    that reasons for my decision would be forthcoming.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent in this appeal sought an order to compel the Peel Regional Police
    Service (PRPS) to expunge certain records it had retained and to enjoin it
    from transmitting information contained in these records to anyone. The respondent,
    as part of his submission, argued that the maintenance of the records and
    transmission of the information violated certain of his rights under the <i>Canadian
    Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>. He was partly successful<span style='font-size:
12.0pt;'>.  </span><span
lang=EN-US>The application judge denied the respondent’s request for an order
    expunging the records but did enjoin the PRPS from disseminating the information
    in the records to others. Both sides have appealed the decision.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    proposed intervener has substantial experience in promoting and defending
    the civil liberties of Canadians and in examining the boundaries of acceptable
    police conduct.  I disagree with counsel for the PRPS and find that the Canadian
    Civil Liberties Association has the expertise that would enable it to make
    a valuable contribution in matters such as this.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the test for permitting intervention does not end once the expertise of the
    proposed intervener is established. As stated by Dubin C.J.O. in <i>Peel
    (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName

    Regional
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">

    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), one must also consider the nature of the case, the issues which arise
    and potential prejudice to the immediate parties.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    as stated by McMurtry C.J.O. in <i>R. v. A.M.</i>, [2005] O.J. No. 4017 (
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), at para. 4:</p>
  <p align=left class="Doubleindent-quote" style='text-align:left'>In most cases, an intervener who participates
    as a friend of the court is required, as a term of intervention, to take
    the record as it exists and not seek to augment the record. This condition
    is imposed to ensure economy and fairness to the parties and to prevent an
    intervenor from changing the focus, scope or nature of the proceedings by
    changing the record.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the CCLA proposes to raise the following issues for consideration
    by the court:</p>
  <p align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    PRPS failed to comply with requirements of the <i>Police Services Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. P.15,<i> </i>by not establishing policies and practices for
    disclosure of personal information about individuals.</p>
  <p align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    PRPS failed to consider whether disclosure in this particular case was reasonable.</p>
  <p align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    PRPS failed to provide a process or opportunity for an individual to be heard
    on the issue of disclosure.</p>
  <p align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    PRPS policies and practices are vague, arbitrary and overbroad.</p>
  <p align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Since
    the PRPS provided access to other police services, affected individuals may
    receive inconsistent treatment with respect to disclosure, depending on the
    jurisdiction in which a request for police records is made.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    CCLA proposes to argue that these deficiencies violate rights guaranteed
    under the <i>Charter.  </i>These are important issues. Unfortunately, these
    issues were not raised or dealt with in the lower court and are raised for
    the first time by the proposed intervener at the appellate stage.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    applicant in the lower court raised and framed the issues. The PRPS responded
    to the issues and arguments raised by the applicant. While it appears that <i>Charter</i> issues
    were raised in respect of the broad questions of retention and disclosure,
    it is apparent that none of the parties considered the existence, adequacy
    or application of the particular policies or practices of the PRPS as having
    a bearing on the outcome of the litigation. Because these were not “live” issues
    in the lower court, the record in this regard is sparse or nonexistent. Similarly,
    as they were not raised before him, the decision of the application judge
    does not touch on the specific issues raised by the proposed intervener.
    As a result, the record in the lower court and before this court has not
    been developed so as to permit a proper analysis of the issues put forward
    by the CCLA. In my view, permitting the intervention of the CCLA to make
    its proposed arguments, at this point, would have the effect of changing
    the focus, scope and nature of the proceedings and would inevitably require
    the creation of a record significantly different from the one now before
    the court. In my view, to permit the proposed intervention at this time would
    cause <span lang=EN-US>injustice to the PRPS and would necessitate a delay
    in the hearing of the appeal scheduled for November 17 - a hearing that has
    already been adjourned on one earlier occasion.</span> </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    although I attribute no fault to the CCLA for the lateness of this motion,
    I am satisfied that permitting its intervention less than two weeks before
    the hearing would be unfair to the PRPS. As stated by McMurtry C.J.O. in <i>Oakwell
    Engineering Ltd. v. Enernorth Industries Inc.</i>,<i> </i>[2006] O.J. No.
    1942 (C.A.), at para. 13:</p>
  <p align=left class="Doubleindent-quote" style='text-align:left'>Only in exceptional circumstances would
    an intervention, bringing more extensive arguments, be permitted so close
    to the hearing date of an appeal when the parties have already delivered
    their factums and would have little time to properly prepare for and respond
    to any new arguments.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    indicated earlier, I am satisfied that the issues raised by the CCLA are
    important and may well merit consideration. Unfortunately, in my view, such
    consideration will have to wait for another case when the parties have had
    the opportunity to provide an appropriate evidentiary record against which
    to consider the issues. As a result, this motion is dismissed. In the circumstances,
    there is no order as to costs.</p>
