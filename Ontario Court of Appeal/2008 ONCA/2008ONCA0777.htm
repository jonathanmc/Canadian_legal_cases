    appellant and his co-accused, David MacDonald, were convicted of first degree
    murder in relation to the death of Robert LeClair.  This appeal was heard
    together with that of the appellant’s co-accused.  As there are common issues,
    these reasons should be read together with the reasons for judgment in <i>R.
    v. MacDonald</i>, 2008 ONCA 778.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>LeClair
    was found dead in the living room of his apartment.  He had been brutally
    beaten and murdered one or two weeks earlier.  The victim had suffered blunt
    force trauma to his head, in excess of 35 wounds to various parts of his
    body, and his throat had been slit.  The apartment was found in disarray.  On
    the living room floor, there was a broken toilet tank lid, a concrete block,
    a pair of scissors, clothes and a mattress, all of which had blood on them.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Neither
    the appellant nor MacDonald testified at trial, although the appellant’s
    out-of-court statement to the police was admitted into evidence.  The appellant
    initially told the police he never went to the victim’s apartment.  When
    faced with DNA evidence from a cigarette butt found in the apartment, he
    admitted to being present when the murder took place and gave a detailed
    account of what had transpired.  However, he attributed all acts of violence
    to his co-accused, MacDonald. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown also led evidence that the appellant confessed to his girlfriend, Melanie
    Gurnsey, and two other friends.  Gurnsey testified that on one night in November,
    the appellant and MacDonald came home, high on cocaine, in an agitated state
    and covered in blood and confessed to killing LeClair.  At the preliminary
    inquiry, Gurnsey testified that MacDonald made the confession in the presence
    of the appellant.  At trial, she swore that it was the appellant who confessed
    in the presence of MacDonald.  Gurnsey’s credibility was strongly attacked
    by the defence and was a central issue in the trial.  Two other friends of
    the appellant, Sonia Lemmon and her husband Michael DesLauriers, also testified
    that the appellant had confessed his involvement in the murder to them. </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant raises three grounds of appeal against his conviction for first
    degree murder.  He argues that the trial judge erred by:</p>
  <p><span>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>failing

    the appellant’s prior acts of violence;</p>
  <p><span>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>failing
    to give a proper instruction with respect to the appellant’s statements to
    civilian witnesses; and </p>
  <p><span>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>misdirecting
    the jury with respect to liability for first degree murder under s. 231(5)(e)
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  (On this issue, the appellant simply adopted
    the submissions made by MacDonald.)</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h3><i>1.    Did the trial judge fail to provide an adequate limiting instruction
      in relation to the evidence of the appellant’s prior acts of violence?</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge erred by failing to provide an adequate
    limiting instruction with respect to evidence that he had assaulted Melanie
    Gurnsey and others prior to the murder. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    was not a case like <i>R. v. B. (F.F.)</i>, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 697,<i> </i>where
    no limiting instruction was given.  Here, a limiting instruction was given
    and the issue is whether it was sufficient to deal with the appellant’s history
    of violence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge instructed the jury as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>There has been evidence that the accused used drugs,
    went to gay bars, and maybe, in the case of Mr. Thrasher, engaged in sexual
    acts with men, had criminal records, had been in jail, and lived a life style
    that many of you might not approve.  This evidence came before you as a necessary
    part of what took place that was involved in this crime and these accused,
    and it cannot be used by you in determining their guilt or innocence.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The accused are charged with a specific crime:
    the murder of Mr. LeClair. The fact that you might not approve of their lifestyles,
    and that they were involved in drugs and other crimes, does not make them
    guilty of this crime, and should not influence your decision in reaching
    a verdict in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge erred in failing to deal specifically
    with the evidence of the appellant’s propensity to violence and by failing
    to warn the jury about the danger of propensity reasoning. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not accept the submission that the language of the limiting instruction
    regarding the appellant’s “lifestyle” and his “crimes” was insufficient to
    encompass the evidence that the appellant had, on occasion, been assaultive
    towards Gurnsey and others.  Nor do I accept the submission that the trial
    judge was required to use the word “propensity”.  No doubt the trial judge
    could have used different language to bring home to the jury that they were
    not to convict the appellant because he was the sort of person to commit
    this offence.  However, I am satisfied that very message was delivered with
    sufficient clarity. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    assessing whether the trial judge erred by failing to deal specifically with
    the appellant’s history of violence and the overall fairness of the charge
    in relation to propensity reasoning, I must read the impugned instruction
    in the context of how this trial unfolded and in light of the failure of
    the appellant’s trial counsel to object.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown did not invite propensity reasoning.  The Crown used the evidence of
    the appellant’s assaultive behaviour to explain why Gurnsey feared the appellant
    and therefore had attributed the confession to MacDonald at the preliminary
    inquiry. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the other hand, counsel for MacDonald submitted to the jury – as he was entitled
    to do – that the appellant’s propensity for violence was relevant to his
    client’s defence that the appellant was the killer and that MacDonald was
    a passive observer.  I pause to note that I do not agree with the appellant’s
    submission that this was the “core” of MacDonald’s defence, but it certainly
    was one aspect of his defence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Apart
    from a passing reference to MacDonald’s submission, the trial judge made
    no reference to this aspect of MacDonald’s defence.  He did not charge the
    jury that the appellant’s propensity for violence was something the jury
    could take into account in relation to MacDonald’s defence.  Such an instruction
    would have required the judge to distinguish the permissible use of propensity
    reasoning in relation to MacDonald’s defence and the impermissible use of
    propensity reasoning in relation to the Crown’s case against the appellant:
    see<i> R. v. Suzack</i> (2000), 141 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (Ont. C.A.), at para.
    111, leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused (2001), 150 O.A.C. 197n and <i>R.
    v. Pollock </i>(2004), 187 C.C.C. (3d) 213 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    C.A.), at para. 109, leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [2005] 1 S.C.R. xiv.  It
    would, however, have emphasized the fact that the appellant did have such
    a propensity and, given the complexity of the distinction, from the appellant’s
    perspective there was perhaps a risk that the jury might confuse what it
    could and could not make of the appellant’s propensity for violence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge conducted a line-by-line review of his draft charge and thereby
    afforded trial counsel advance opportunity to suggest changes and refinements.  The
    appellant’s experienced trial counsel did not ask the trial judge to give
    a more explicit instruction regarding the appellant’s propensity for violence.  He
    made no objection on this point after the charge was delivered.  In my view,
    this is telling.  Had he asked for a more explicit discussion of the appellant’s
    propensity for violence in the limiting instruction, he almost certainly
    would have invited a detailed <i>Suzak</i> instruction in relation to MacDonald’s
    defence.  This might have only served to draw attention to the appellant’s
    propensity for violence and the appellant might well have been better off
    with the unspecific general instruction that the trial judge used.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    any event, the failure of defence counsel to raise this point at trial is
    a factor to be considered in assessing the adequacy of the charge on this
    issue.  It indicates that from the perspective of an experienced counsel
    who mounted a vigorous defence, on balance, the instruction as given was
    not prejudicial to the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h3><i>2.    Did the trial judge fail to give a proper instruction with respect
      to the appellant’s statements</i><i> to civilian witnesses? </i></h3>
  <p><i><span>(i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></i><i>The
      relation of the facts to the law</i> </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge failed in his instructions to explain
    how the confessions of prior acts of perjury, the prior inconsistent statements,
    and the animus towards the appellant on the part of the witnesses who testified
    as to his involvement in the murder could affect the jury’s assessment of
    whether the statements were made, whether they were accurately conveyed,
    and whether they were true.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not accept this submission.  The trial judge gave the standard instruction
    on assessing witness credibility.  He correctly instructed the jurors that
    they must first decide if the statement was made and that if they did not
    find that the appellant made it, it could not be used against him.  He then
    reviewed, in detail, the evidence about the statements in issue.  He gave
    a strong <i>Vetrovec</i> instruction with respect to two of the witnesses.  In
    his summary of the parties’ theories of the case, he reviewed in detail the
    appellants’ attacks on the credibility of the Crown’s witnesses which was
    the central pillar of the case for the defence. Finally, and again tellingly,
    there was no objection to this aspect of the charge at trial.  </p>
  <p><i>(ii)    Adequacy of the Vetrovec warning</i> </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant complains that while the trial judge gave a strong <i>Vetrovec </i>warning
    in relation to Melanie Gurnsey and Sonia Lemmon, he did not explain to the
    jury what kind of evidence could reasonably support the credibility of these
    witnesses, nor did he explain that to be confirmatory, the evidence had to
    relate to a material aspect of the case.  The appellant submits that given
    the frailties of Gurnsey’s evidence, evidence that specifically supported
    her story that the appellant, as opposed to MacDonald, made the confession,
    was required.  The appellant also argues that the trial judge was required,
    as part of his <i>Vetrovec</i> instruction, to explain not only what evidence
    supported her story, but also what evidence undermined it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the respondent that the <i>Vetrovec </i>instruction and the manner
    in which the trial judge dealt with the supporting and corroborating evidence
    was sufficient.  The disreputable nature of Gurnsey and Lemmon and the need
    for treating their evidence with caution was a central issue at the trial.  Counsels’
    closing addresses focused extensively on whether these two witnesses were
    believable and reviewed evidence that either contradicted or corroborated
    their testimony. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is worth recalling that the central message from <i>Vetrovec v. The Queen</i>,
    [1982] 1 S.C.R. 811<i> </i>was, as Dickson J. put it at p. 823, to reject
    the “blind and empty formalism” of a “universal rule” in favour of a common-sense
    approach that vests trial judges with a broad discretion to decide how best
    to deal with the evidence.  There is no prescribed, formulaic approach and
    no “ritualistic incantation” to be followed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge outlined the positions of counsel and reminded the jury both
    of the evidence that undermined Gurnsey’s story and the evidence that supported
    it.  While this was done in a different section of the charge than the actual <i>Vetrovec</i> instruction,
    the jury was certainly not left in the dark as to the evidence that was capable
    of supporting Gurnsey’s story.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once
    again, it is important to note that the appellant’s trial counsel did not
    object, nor did he raise this issue during the pre-charge conference.  Moreover,
    this was not a case where there was little or no evidence to corroborate
    the disreputable witness.  The record was replete with corroborating evidence
    and it almost certainly would not have assisted the appellant if the trial
    judge had conducted a detailed review of that extensive body of evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not accept the appellant’s submission that the jury should have been told
    that it was only safe to rely on Gurnsey’s testimony if there was evidence
    to support her on the specific issue of who made the confession.  We were
    cited no authority for raising the bar to such a high level and in my view,
    the proposition is contrary to established case law: see e.g. <i>R. v. Kehler</i>,
    [2004] 1 S.C.R. 328.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I would not give effect to this ground of appeal. </p>
  <h3><i><span style='font-weight:normal;'>(iii)   Hearsay evidence</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge erred by failing to give an adequate
    instruction in relation to Lemmon’s evidence regarding the appellant’s statement
    to DesLauriers.  Lemmon overheard one statement and DesLauriers told her
    about another. </p>

    see no error warranting appellate intervention.  Neither the Crown nor the
    trial judge invited the jury to use Lemmon’s evidence of what DesLauriers
    told her the appellant said.  When Lemmon testified, she made it clear she
    was trying to differentiate between what she heard Thrasher say on the one
    hand, from hearsay from DesLauriers about what Thrasher said to him, on the
    other.  The appellant’s closing reminded the jury of Lemmon’s effort to limit
    her evidence to what she heard the appellant say.  The trial judge gave the
    jury a general instruction on hearsay evidence and he distinguished what
    Lemmon said she heard from Thrasher’s lips as opposed to what she heard from
    DesLauriers’.  Again, there was no objection raised by counsel either during
    the pre-charge conference or after the charge was given. </p>
