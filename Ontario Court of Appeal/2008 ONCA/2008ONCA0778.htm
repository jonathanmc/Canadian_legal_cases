  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant appeals his conviction of first degree murder.  This appeal was
    heard together with that of the appellant’s co-accused, Luke Thrasher, who
    was also convicted of first degree murder.  As there are common issues, these
    reasons should be read together with the reasons for judgment in <i>R. v.
    Thrasher</i>,&nbsp;2008 ONCA 777.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    facts giving rise to the charge of first degree murder are briefly set out
    in <i>Thrasher</i>.
     The Crown’s case against the appellant was not as strong as the case against
    Thrasher since Thrasher’s out-of-court statements were not admissible against
    the appellant.  However, there was still considerable evidence against the
    appellant.  DNA from a cigarette butt found in the victim’s apartment matched
    that of the appellant.  The police surreptitiously recorded a conversation
    between the appellant and Thrasher while they were being driven to a bail
    hearing in which the appellant made a statement from which it could be inferred,
    at the very least, that he had been present when LeClair was murdered.  Finally,
    there was Melanie Gurnsey’s evidence of Thrasher’s post-murder confession
    made in the presence of the appellant and her testimony that the appellant
    contributed details indicating his acquiescence in its truth.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant raises three grounds of appeal. </p>
  <h3><i>1.    Unreasonable verdict</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that Melanie Gurnsey’s evidence was so fraught with lies,
    contradictions and inconsistencies with other evidence led by the Crown that
    the conviction cannot survive judicial scrutiny when viewed “through the
    lens of judicial experience which serves as an additional protection against
    an unwarranted conviction”: <i>R. v. Biniaris</i>, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 381, at
    para. 40.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, there is no merit to this submission.  There is no question that
    Gurnsey’s evidence was problematic from a variety of perspectives.  Those
    problems were very much the focus of this trial.  Gurnsey was subjected to
    vigorous cross-examination and her lies and inconsistencies were probed in
    great detail by both defence counsel in their closing addresses.  The trial
    judge reviewed those positions in his instructions and the jury was given
    a strong <i>Vetrovec</i> warning. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    am not persuaded that there is any principled basis to distinguish this case
    from countless others that turn on the credibility and reliability of a disreputable
    witness.  It was up to the twelve ordinary men and women on the jury who
    sat through the trial to assess her evidence and to decide whether the Crown
    had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant further submits that the verdict of first degree murder under either
    s. 231(2) or s. 231(5)(e) of the <i>Criminal Code </i>was unreasonable as
    the evidence adduced at trial did not support a finding of either “planning
    and deliberation” or “forcible confinement” on the part of the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    reject this submission.  In my view there was evidence which, if believed
    by the jury, could support a verdict of first degree murder either on the
    basis of planning and deliberation or forcible confinement. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    was open to the jury to find that there was planning and deliberation by
    accepting Gurnsey’s evidence that Thrasher, in the presence of the appellant,
    described how he had said to the appellant after they had severely beaten
    the victim “we’re going to have to kill him” to prevent the victim from identifying
    them.  Gurnsey also testified that the appellant said that it took a long
    time to kill the victim, again providing indication of a prolonged and deliberate
    killing.  The crime scene evidence also indicated a prolonged attack involving
    both deliberation and unlawful confinement.  The evidence that the appellant
    had tried to get the victim’s PIN number and that, before they slit the victim’s
    throat, the appellant had gone more than once to an ATM in an attempt to
    get cash, was further evidence from which the jury could find that the murder
    had been committed in the course of an unlawful confinement.</p>
  <h3><i>2.      Did the trial judge misdirect the jury with respect to liability
      under s. 231 (5)(e)?</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge failed to adequately instruct the
    jury as to the constituent elements of first degree murder under s. 231(5)(e)
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i> based on death caused while the offence of unlawful
    confinement is being committed.  That section reads:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>231(5) Irrespective of whether a murder is planned
    and deliberate on the part of any person, murder is first degree murder in
    respect of a person <i>when the death is caused by that person</i> while
    committing or attempting to commit an offence under one of the following
    sections: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(<i>e</i>) section 279 (kidnapping and forcible
    confinement) [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is clear from the italicized words that in order to be convicted of first
    degree murder under s. 231(5)(e), an accused must himself or herself have
    caused the death: see <i>R. v. Almarales, </i>2008 ONCA 692.  On the other
    hand, the phrase “when death is caused by that person” is broad enough to
    include an accused who assists in the murder provided that the accused is
    a substantial cause of the death: <i>R. v. Harbottle</i>, [1993] 3 S.C.R.
    306. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant relies on the following passage from <i>Harbottle</i> at p. 325
    where Cory J. identified five elements of first degree murder under the predecessor
    to s. 231(5):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[A]n accused may be<span class="DoubleIndentQuote"> found
      guilty of first degree murder&nbsp;&nbsp; pursuant to s.&nbsp;214(5) if
    the Crown has established beyond a reasonable doubt that: </span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(1) the accused was guilty of the underlying crime
    of domination or of attempting to commit that crime; </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(2) the accused was guilty of the murder of the
    victim; </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(3) the accused participated in the murder in such
    a manner that he was a substantial cause of the death of the victim; </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(4) there was no
      intervening act of another which resulted in the accused no longer being
    substantially connected to the death of the victim; and&nbsp; </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span class="DoubleIndentQuote">(5)
    the crimes of domination and murder were part of the same transaction; that
    is to say, the death was caused while committing the off</span>ence of domination
    as part of the same series of events.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    impugned portion of the jury instructions reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>In respect to the charge
    of first-degree murder, an accused cannot be guilty of first-degree murder
    as an aider or abettor, he must be a principal - an active participant in
    the killing - and, where planning and deliberation are relied on, an active
    participant in the plan and the deliberation, and where committing the offence
    of unlawful confinement is relied on, an active participant in the unlawful
    confinement. Of course, there can be two principals - two active participants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge failed to instruct the jury with respect
    to the third and fourth elements set out in <i>Harbottle</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the jury could well have convicted him of first degree
    murder without finding that he “participated in the murder in such a manner
    that he was a substantial cause of the death” as they would or could have
    understood that his participation in the forcible confinement alone rendered
    him guilty of first degree murder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    disagree with this submission.  As I read the impugned passage from the charge,
    the trial judge clearly instructed the jury that the accused could not be
    convicted of first degree murder unless the jury were satisfied of the following:</p>
  <p><span style='font-size:12.0pt;
'>(</span>1)       that he had been an active participant in the killing <i>and</i>;</p>
  <p>(2)       an active participant in either </p>
  <p>(a) the planning and deliberation or </p>
  <p>(b) in the unlawful confinement, as the case may be.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    the accused was “an active participant in the killing” <i>as well as </i>“an
    active participant in either the planning and deliberation or in the unlawful
    confinement”, he “participated in the murder in such a manner that he was
    a substantial cause of the death”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    note that in David Watt, <i>Watt’s Manual of Criminal Jury Instructions</i> (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Toronto: Thomson
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Carswell, 2005) at p. 458, both the phrases “active participant in the killing” and
    doing
    “something that is an ‘essential and integral part of the killing’” are used
    to explain the same element as if they are equivalents.  I agree with that
    interpretation. Moreover, the trial judge instructed the jury on aiding and
    abetting in relation to second degree murder.  In this portion of his charge,
    he explained that the appellant could not be convicted of first degree murder
    on that basis.  This provided the jury with further guidance on the need
    for the Crown to prove the appellant’s active involvement in the killing
    itself. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the safer course is to follow all of the language recommended in <i>Watt’s
    Manual</i>, I cannot say that in this case, when the instruction is read
    as a whole, that the trial judge erred by using the phrase “active participant
    in the killing”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    fact that the trial judge did not instruct the jury that there must be no
    intervening cause is immaterial in the circumstances of this case as there
    was no evidence of any intervening cause.  I note that the trial judge conducted
    a detailed review of his instructions at the pre-charge conference.  The
    appellant’s trial counsel brought up the issue of intervening cause in the
    context of the issue of forcible confinement, but, when questioned by the
    trial judge, admitted that there was no evidence of an intervening cause
    and, in the end, voiced no objection to the trial judge’s charge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h3><i>3.         Did the trial judge fail to relate evidence to the critical
      issues?</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge failed to relate the evidence to the
    critical issues of planning and deliberation, forcible confinement and the
    evidence capable of supporting Gurnsey’s evidence, which was subject to a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    disagree.  The trial judge identified the evidence capable of supporting
    planning and deliberation and forcible confinement when summarizing the position
    of the Crown. Reading the charge as a whole, I am satisfied that the jury
    could be left in no doubt as to how the evidence related to these central
    issues. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons given in <i>Thrasher</i>, I am satisfied that there was no error
    in relation to the <i>Vetrovec</i> warning and the issue of corroboration. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    again on these points, trial counsel did not mention the need for more explicit
    instructions during the pre-charge conference and did not object after the
    charge was given. <u></u></p>
