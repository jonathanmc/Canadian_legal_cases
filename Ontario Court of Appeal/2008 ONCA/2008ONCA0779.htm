    and Ed became friends when Jim bought a boat from Ed in 1987. In 1992-1993
    the two entered into an informal arrangement; Ed would work for Jim without
    salary while continuing as a boat salesman. Jim, who was then developing
    his business, was unable to pay Ed a salary. However, in the event that Ed
    made any sales, Jim would pay him a commission. Ed also provided some short-term
    financial assistance to Jim’s business, for which he was later reimbursed.
    During this period, Jim and Ed discussed Ed’s participation in the business
    over and above any commissions he might earn. While they did not record their
    discussions in writing, Ed wrote to Jim in December 1993 confirming their
    verbal agreement that he “would be given shares in the company.” </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ed
    became a full-time employee of WEMI in 1995 at a salary of $60,000 per year.
    When he was terminated on March 12, 2004 Ed was earning $75,000 a year and
    received a car allowance of $600 a month and other benefits.</p>
  <p class=StandardParagraph style='line-height:

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Throughout
    the years of his employment, Ed continued to press for the equity interest
    in the business that he had been promised. On these occasions Jim reiterated,
    in vague terms that Ed would receive an interest in the business and offered
    reasons why there were delays in that happening. Eventually, Ed retained
    counsel who arranged a meeting with WEMI’s counsel to address Ed’s share
    agreement with WEMI. The meeting was scheduled to take place on Monday, March
    15, 2004. The meeting did not take place however, because WEMI summarily
    terminated Ed’s employment on Friday, March 12, 2004. Ed sued and at trial
    was awarded the relief described above.</p>

      appellants submit that the trial judge based his calculation of the notice
      period for wrongful dismissal on the entire time that Ed promoted the sale

      They submit that the trial judge erred by considering the time that Ed
      worked without salary to be part of his length of service. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge did comment that the “the record contemporary to the plaintiff’s
      entire association with the defendant bespeaks a valued and dedicated employee.”
    However he made this comment in the course of rejecting the appellants’ attempt
    to portray Ed as an ineffective employee. The appellants had led evidence
    that was “pejorative of the plaintiff’s character and contribution to the
    defendant’s operation.” The trial judge’s observation that contemporaneous
    documents showed that the appellants regarded Ed as a dedicated employee
    at all times was well grounded in the evidence. As I read his reasons, the
    trial judge commented on Ed’s entire association with the company in this
    context, not for the purpose of calculating Ed’s length of service. </span></p>

      range for an employee of Ed’s age, responsibilities and qualifications

      is no basis for reducing the trial judge’s assessment of the notice period.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>Ed’s Entitlement to an Equity Interest</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s finding that Ed was promised and was entitled to an equity
    interest in the business was abundantly supported by the evidence. Ed kept
    notes of many of his discussions with Jim and documents written by the appellants
    or their representatives confirmed the existence of an agreement that Ed
    would receive shares in the business. I need note only some examples.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    business plan of WEMI drawn up in 1996, which was produced for potential
    investors, clearly indicated that Ed held 5% of the company. It doesn’t matter
    that the business plan was prepared only for discussion purposes with potential
    investors and was never implemented. Even considered as a draft, it is a
    document prepared by WEMI and corroborates Ed’s claim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    a letter dated January 26, 2001 Jim wrote to Ed stating “Walter Bowen at
    Castles [sic] Brock has frozen your 5% shares. The structure of the company
    will be put in place including issuing all shares to current shareholders
    before any investors come on board.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Howard
    Schwartz, president and chief operating officer of WEMI wrote to Ed on February
    4, 2003 and referred to Ed’s claim of an allocation of 5% shares in the family
    holding company. Schwartz wrote:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>As you may be aware this would be subject to the prior
    interest of Jim because of the time and money spent by him in the development
    of the patents and other intellectual property rights. As was discussed with
    you, there were 5 people who had the same allocation, those being with you,
    Stephen Wright [Jim’s son], Carol Osborne [Jim’s daughter], Dennis Osborne
    [Jim’s son-in-law] and Burt Baillie, who started Wright Environmental with
    Jim Wright. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Not
    only was Ed’s claim corroborated by the available documents, but in addition
    the trial judge made credibility findings that were determinative. He said “[d]istilled
    to its essence, the narrative inherent in the plaintiff’s evidence is true;
    that inherent in the defence is inherently false. Collectively, the evidence
    given by James and Stephen Wright, as well as that given by Patrick Michaud
    was tendentious, contrived and in some instances callous. It was designed
    to portray the plaintiff in the darkest of shades in the face of compelling
    circumstances that gave the lie to their evidence.”  He described Jim’s evidence
    as more distinguished for its bias than for its contents. The trial judge
    found Jim’s memory to be more convenient than convincing, with obfuscation
    being one of the hallmarks of his evidence. He concluded that Jim’s evidence
    was “not defined by candour or credit.” The trial judge concluded that Ed’s
    evidence should be believed whenever there was a conflict between Ed’s evidence
    and that of any of the principal witnesses for the appellants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s credibility findings are manifestly justified on the record.
    Those findings and the compelling documentary evidence make untenable the
    appellants’ argument that Ed was not entitled to 5% equity interest in the
    business. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>The scope of Ed’s equity interest</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge concluded that Ed was entitled to “a 5% interest in the company,
    in its broadest sense.” His formal judgment granted Ed a 5% interest in 120
    as well as in WEMI. These were the only corporations named as defendants.
    The appellants submit that the trial judge erred by granting Ed a 5% interest
    in 120.  I agree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ed’s
    evidence about the arrangement that entitled him to a 5% equity interest
    in “the business”, while extensive and adamant, was not precise. As the trial
    judge noted, Ed did not have a sophisticated understanding of corporations
    generally and little knowledge of the corporate structure of WEMI. The arrangement
    was an oral one, and neither Ed nor Jim had legal advice at the time they
    made it. Ed variously described what he had been promised as 5% “family shares”, “founding
    WEMI shares”, “original Wright family holding company shares”, “founding
    shares”, and “family founding shares”. For example, Ed’s diary entry of June
    3, 1996 indicated that Jim had affirmed that he held “family shares at 5%” but
    could take “normal Wright shares” if he wanted. None of these terms were
    used in the corporate documents relating to corporate structure of the business. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge summed up Ed’s position as understanding that he was to be “regarded
    as part of the inner circle and would be treated as a ‘family member’”. This
    is consonant with what Ed pleaded in paragraph 20 of his statement of claim:
    that he always understood the term “family founding shares to reflect the
    fact that he’d been granted equity <u>in the business.</u>” [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> “The
    business”, for which Ed worked initially without salary, that eventually
    employed him, and to which he contributed some capital was the marketing
    of the composter technology that Jim invented. The draft business plan prepared
    in 1995/1996, upon which Ed relied to establish his 5% claim, indicates clearly
    that Jim held the patents and had granted WEMI the licence to directly exploit
    the technology in all markets, except in the

    120 was created to hold the patents. 120 owns no shares of WEMI and WEMI
    owns no shares in 120. Jim is the sole shareholder of 120. No “family member” or
    part of “the inner circle” holds shares in 120.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    describing the oral arrangement as it was first made, Ed never testified
    that he was promised part ownership of the patents or even that Jim told
    him that WEMI owned or would own the patents. As noted above, Ed’s earliest
    claim was that he “would be given shares in the company.”
    The company at that time was WEMI. In the absence of any evidence that at
    the time the contractual arrangement was made the contracting parties agreed
    that WEMI or “the family” owned or would own the patents, there was no basis
    for awarding Ed a proprietary interest in the patents. Ed, at most, was entitled
    only to the same treatment as other family members. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would set aside the trial judge’s award to Ed of a 5% interest in 120, leaving
    the award of a 5% interest in WEMI in place.</p>

lang=EN-US>Breach of Fiduciary Duty</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge provided scant reason to support his award of $30,000 damages
      for breach of fiduciary duties payable jointly and severally by all the
      appellants. He merely said that these damages were to recognize “the unique
      relationship that was created between the plaintiff and Jim which required
      the latter to act in good faith and with candour in his dealings with the
      former.” </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Neither
    120 nor Eileen had a relationship with Ed. For most of the time 120 did not
    exist and when it was created, the only thing it did was hold the patents
    that WEMI was licensed to exploit. Eileen and Ed were fellow shareholders
    in WEMI. The evidence discloses no basis upon which either Eileen or 120
    could be found to be a fiduciary of Ed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Arrangements
    entitling employees or others to shares in a business are not unique or even
    unusual. Other than the ability to honour or breach the contract with Ed,
    Jim and WEMI held no discretion or power that they could unilaterally exercise
    to affect his interests and to which he was peculiarly vulnerable. More than
    a contract entitling Ed to equity in the business is required to create a
    fiduciary relationship. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>I
      would set aside the trial judge’s finding of a breach of fiduciary duty
      and the consequent award of damages he made for breach of that duty.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>Exemplary Damages</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the hearing, the appellants submitted that the trial judge’s award of exemplary
    damages of $25,000 should be set aside. They argued that the appropriate
    remedy, if one were warranted, would be an award of <i>Wallace</i> damages
    against WEMI by increasing the notice period. They asserted that the trial
    judge, by awarding exemplary damages, was punishing them for the manner in
    which their counsel conducted the trial. In addition, they argued that the
    award of exemplary damages against Jim could not stand as there was no finding
    of an actionable wrong independent of Ed’s employment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge stated he was not satisfied that the circumstances surrounding
    Ed’s termination mandated the application of the <i>Wallace</i> principle.
    He made clear the exemplary damages he awarded were not compensatory in nature
    but punitive. He stated that he regarded the breach of the employment contract
    as “almost incidental” to the breach of the agreement to give shares in the
    business. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    premise of the appellants’ argument that <i>Wallace</i> damages and not punitive
    damages might have been appropriate is that there was but one contract – an
    employment contract, a term of which entitled the employee to shares in the
    business. However, the trial judge took the view there were two separate
    contracts—one for a share of the business and the other for employment. The
    fact that the agreement to give Ed a share of the business was made years
    before he was employed by WEMI makes the trial judge’s analysis justifiable.
    The breach of the employment agreement was incidental to the breach of the
    prior agreement to give Ed a share of the business.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants are correct that exemplary damages are rarely awarded in a contract
    case and in any event, require an “actionable wrong” in addition to the breach
    sued upon. Here, this was the related breach of the employment contract.  WEMI
    fired Ed just before the meeting arranged by his counsel to deal with his
    contract for shares in the business. The circumstances of the breach were
    egregious and rightly offended the conscience of the court. The trial judge
    made it clear that this award of damages was not compensatory, but was intended
    to indicate the court’s displeasure with the heinousness of the defendants’ conduct.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would not interfere with the award of exemplary damages against WEMI.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>Oppression</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s simply stated that his award of the oppression remedy was well
    founded on the facts as he found them. Reading his reasons as a whole makes
    evident that the basis for the award is that Ed earned his equity in the
    business by “sweat labour” but was unfairly deprived of the interests and
    rights of a shareholder by the way the affairs of the corporation were conducted.
    Granting the oppression remedy on such a basis was within the scope of the
    trial judge’s discretion. I see no basis to interfere.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    a court must guard against too easily resorting to the oppression remedy
    when other remedies are adequate, here the oppression remedy is required
    to support the trial judge’s order that Ed’s shares be redeemed. The facts
    as found by the trial judge make an order that the Ed’s share interest be
    redeemed sensible in the circumstances. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>The Reference</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rule
    54.02 permits a judge, without the consent of the parties, to order a reference
    where a prolonged examination of documents or investigation is required that
    cannot conveniently be made at trial or where there is a substantial issue
    in dispute that requires the taking of accounts. Here a reference is required
    to assess the value of Ed’s share interest in WEMI. There is no merit to
    the appellants’ submission that the trial judge erred by bifurcating the
    trial by ordering a reference. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    being said, the directions the trial judge gave for the reference need to
    be modified in some respects. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    those directions are predicated on Ed being entitled to a 5% interest in
    both WEMI and 120. I would amend paragraphs 6 (e), (f), (g), and (h) of the
    judgment to delete all references to 120. The reference can inquire into
    the affairs of 120 to the extent that it is an “associated and affiliated
    business entity” of WEMI, or that improperly inflated licence fees were paid
    to it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the trial judge’s directions provide that Jim and Eileen return to WEMI any
    money found to have been improperly taken from it. This order is unnecessary
    given the order that Ed’s share interest be redeemed. Once any money improperly
    taken out of WEMI is accounted for in the evaluation of Ed’s share interest,
    it is immaterial if the money is actually returned or not.</p>

lang=EN-US>Substantial indemnity costs</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellants did not contest the trial judge’s award of substantial indemnity
      costs, but submitted that the amount awarded should be reduced to the extent
      of their success on appeal. While the appellants have succeeded on some
      issues, I would not interfere with the trial judge’s discretion in awarding
      substantial indemnity costs at trial. He made it clear that he awarded
      that scale of costs because of the way the appellants conducted the trial,
      commenting that they wasted much trial time attempting to tarnish Ed’s
      reputation. </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>Parties</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    judgment at trial was made against all defendants jointly and severally except
    for the damages for wrongful dismissal, which were awarded only against WEMI.
    The trial judge did not explain why he pierced the corporate veil for the
    remaining relief granted but it is evident that he thought it was just and
    equitable to do so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The “just
    and equitable” ground for piercing the corporate veil, suggested in earlier
    cases, was firmly rejected by Sharpe J. in <i>Transamerica Life Insurance
    Co. of Canada v. Canada Life Assurance Co.</i>, 28 O.R. (3d) 423, [1996]
    O.J. No. 1568 and upheld on appeal to this court. In <i>Transamerica </i>Sharpe
    J. quoted from Gower, <i>Modern Company Law</i>, 5th ed. (1992) which sets
    out only three circumstances in which the courts can pierce the corporate
    veil:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1)       When the court is construing a statute,
    contract or other document.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2)       When the court is satisfied that a company
    is a “mere facade” concealing the true facts.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3)       When it can be established that the company
    is an authorized agent of its controllers or its members, corporate or human.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    eighth edition of Gower &amp; Davies,  <i>Principles of Modern Company Law</i> published
    in 2008 says, at page 206:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Although the interests of justice may provide the
    policy impetus for creating exceptions to the doctrines of separate legal
    personality and limited liability, as an exception itself it suffers from
    the defect of being inherently vague and providing to neither courts nor
    those engaged in business any clear guidance as to when the normal company
    law rules should be displaced. Consequently, it is difficult to find cases
    in which “the interests of justice” have represented more than simply a way
    of referring to the grounds identified above in which the veil of incorporation
    has been pierced.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    evidence in this case established none of these circumstances and therefore,
    I see no basis for piercing the corporate veil. This, together with the appellants’ success
    on other issues, makes a cataloguing of the relief against the various parties
    appropriate. I would amend the relief granted as follows:</p>
  <p>1.   the relief granted in paragraph one of the judgment, damages for wrongful
    dismissal against WEMI, remains in place; </p>
  <p>2.   WEMI, alone, is liable for the exemplary damages granted in paragraph
    two of the judgment; </p>
  <p>3.   the damages for breach of fiduciary duties awarded in paragraph three
    of the judgment are set aside; </p>
  <p>4.   paragraph four of the judgment is limited to granting a 5% equity interest
    in WEMI;</p>
  <p>5.   the oppression remedy granted in paragraph five of the judgment applies
    primarily to WEMI, but also supports the order that its director Jim, and
    its majority shareholder Eileen redeem Ed’s share interest if WEMI does not;</p>
  <p>6.   the reference ordered in paragraph six is to determine the value of
    Ed’s 5% equity interest in WEMI; </p>
  <p>7.   paragraphs seven, eight and nine apply only to WEMI; and</p>
  <p>8.   paragraph ten does not apply to 120.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
