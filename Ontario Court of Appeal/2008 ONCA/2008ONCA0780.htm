  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    March 2003, the Ottawa Childrens Aid Society (the CAS) commenced an investigation
    of the appellants household after receiving an anonymous tip that the appellant
    may have physically abused K.B.  During the investigation, K.B. alleged that
    the appellant had sexually abused her.  As a result of this disclosure, K.B.
    was placed in protective foster care for one month.  Ultimately, no charges
    were laid and K.B. returned home.  The appellant, who had moved out of the
    family residence during the inves-tigation, returned home in February 2004,
    subject to supervision by the CAS for six months.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    New Years Eve of 2004, K.B. and her cousin were left with a babysitter.  When
    her cousin became homesick and upset, K.B. tried to cheer her up by saying
    that she was used to staying away from home because of her time in foster
    care, which had happened because of what she had said about her father, and
    that she did not speak about those things anymore.  The babysitter, who had
    no knowledge of the prior CAS investigation, was surprised to hear this statement
    and a week later decided to tell K.B.s mother what she had heard.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    trial, K.B.s mother testified that she was unsure what to do when she heard
    about K.B.s statement and that she had been convinced that K.B.s 2003 allegations
    were false.  Eventually, she sought counselling advice and, acting on that
    advice, contacted the CAS.  She then moved out of the house, taking K.B.
    with her, and moved in with a man with whom she had been having an affair.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    CAS and the police interviewed K.B. over the next two days.  During these
    interviews, K.B. stated that, My daddy made me touch his private parts.  K.B.
    said that this happened on weekend mornings while her mother was asleep and
    K.B. was alone with her father.  She also said that the appellant had warned
    her that if she told anyone what had occurred, Youll go to a foster home
    again.    </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    was evidence at trial that K.B. had seen her parents having sex with each
    other on some occasions.  In addition, the appellant acknowledged at trial
    that he and K.B. watched television together on weekend mornings while his
    wife slept.  He also admitted that K.B. had once seen pornography on television
    at home when he fell asleep and mistakenly forgot to turn off the television.  The
    defence also called a neighbour of the family, B.M., who testified that she
    was a guest every Saturday morning in the appellants home and had never
    seen any inappropriate conduct by the appellant.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    his reasons, the trial judge noted several admissions made by the appellant
    at trial.  In particular, he stated that the appellant had admitted that
    K.B. had watched pornography on television on at least one occasion and that,
    in relation to this viewing, the appellant told K.B.: Dont tell anybody
    or youll go back to foster care.  The appellant asserts that this was a
    serious misapprehension of the evidence of the admissions made by the appellant,
    warranting appellate intervention.  We disagree.</p>

    fallen asleep while pornography was on television, that the pornography was
    still playing when K.B. later awakened him, and that when he awoke, he told
    her: Dont tell mommy or daddy will get into trouble.  During the 2003
    investigation by the CAS, the appellant made similar admissions to a CAS
    caseworker.  He also told the caseworker that K.B. had
    seen too much sexual interaction which was inappropriate for her age.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judges description of the precise statement made by the appellant
    to K.B. on this occasion was inaccurate, as was his depiction of the evidence
    of some of the other details related to the pornography incident.  However,
    in our view, these errors did not play an essential part in the trial judges
    reasoning process leading to the appellants convictions.  On the contrary,
    the reasons reveal that the trial judge fully appreciated the nature and
    significance of the real issue: the appellants admission that K.B. had viewed
    pornography and his assertion, advanced at trial, that this viewing helped
    to explain why a prepubescent girl could describe acts of fellatio and intercourse.  The
    trial judge simply rejected, as he was entitled to do, the defence claim
    that the evidence of this incident and of K.B.s viewing of her parents in
    sexual contact fully explained the content of her allegations of sexually
    abusive conduct by the appellant and supported the defence assertion that
    K.B. had fabricated her allegations.  The trial judges misstatements of
    some of the details of the evidence of this incident were not material to
    his conclusion, on all the evidence, that the events alleged by K.B. had
    occurred.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Nor
    do we accept the appellants contention that the trial judge materially misapprehended
    B.M.s testimony.  The trial judge concluded that B.M.s evidence was deserving
    of little weight.  The reasons indicate that the trial judge understood B.M.s
    claim that she was present at the appellants home for several hours every
    Saturday morning when K.B. alleged that the abusive conduct had occurred.  If
    B.M.s testimony on this issue was accepted, it followed that little, if
    any, opportunity existed for the appellant to have committed the acts described
    by K.B.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    neither K.B. nor her mother testified that B.M. was at their home every Saturday
    morning.  Moreover, both the appellant and K.B. testified that they were
    alone when they watched cartoons together on Saturday mornings while K.B.s
    mother was asleep.  Thus, on this evidence, the opportunity existed for the
    offences to have occurred.  At the conclusion of trial, the appellant himself
    recognized the frailties of B.M.s evidence and placed little reliance on
    it.  In closing submissions, his counsel told the trial judge, I am not
    putting a lot of emphasis on [B.M.s] evidence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    are also not persuaded that the trial judge failed to appreciate the inconsistencies
    in K.B.s version of events.  The trial judge concluded that, the <i>crux</i> of
    the complainants allegations had remained constant and that: The complainant
    never wavered or recanted the <i>nature</i> of her complaints or the <i>manner </i>in
    which she endured the sexual acts.  [Emphasis added.]   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although
    parts of K.B.s trial testimony were inconsistent with some aspects of her
    statement to the police and her evidence at the preliminary inquiry, the
    trial judges conclusions regarding the core elements of her testimony are
    supported by the record.  Indeed, the appellants trial counsel acknowledged
    as much during his closing sub-missions at trial when he indicated that,
    notwithstanding the inconsistencies and contra-dictions in K.B.s evidence,
    she was never shaken with respect to aspects of her main allegations.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judges assessment of K.B.s credibility was based on his recognition
    of the principles that guide the evaluation of the evidence of children:
    see for example, <i>R. v. F. (C.C.)</i> (1997), 120 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (S.C.C.).  He
    was not obliged to recite each inconsistency in K.B.s evidence in his reasons.  We
    see no error in his approach to the assessment of her testimony.  </p>
  <h2><i>(2)       Suggested Reversal of Onus of Proof</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant also argues that the trial judge erred by applying a stricter standard
    of scrutiny to the appellants evidence than he did to that of K.B., thereby
    reversing the onus of proof.  Again, we disagree.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    the appellant indicated before this court, this argument is linked to the
    appellants contention that the trial judge materially misapprehended the
    evidence.  We have already rejected that contention.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    is not a case where the trial judge reached a conclusion on K.B.s credibility
    before considering the defence evidence or the defence position on the central
    issues at trial.  This fact distinguishes this case from many of the cases
    relied on by the appellant.  Apart from the principles that apply generally
    to the evaluation of a childs evidence, the appellant has been unable to
    point to any examples from the trial judges reasons to support his claim
    that the trial judge improperly applied a more exacting standard to the appellants
    evidence than he did to that of K.B.</p>
