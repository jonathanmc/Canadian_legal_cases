style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    applicant has appealed the order of Campbell J. dated November 5, 2008 rejecting
    the applicant’s request to schedule a motion to stay the execution of two
    writs of seizure and sale (the
    “writs”).  Within that appeal, the applicant brings this motion seeking a
    stay of execution of the writs.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion is dismissed.  The underlying appeal is from an interlocutory, not
    a final order.  Thus, this court does not have jurisdiction to hear the appeal,
    nor this motion that is brought pursuant to that appeal.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Campbell
    J.’s endorsement denying the applicant’s request to schedule a motion reads
    as follows:</p>
  <p>Nothing to schedule at this time.  There is no material challenging the
    conviction that has been filed which is the foundation for any possible application
    to this court.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for the applicant concedes that Campbell J. was correct in stating that there
    was no material filed which could form the basis of the order he was seeking.  He
    says that he intends to file that material before the end of this year.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Campbell
    J.’s order did not finally refuse to hear the applicant’s request to schedule
    a motion.  Rather he refused only to schedule it at that time.  He did not
    foreclose the possibility of scheduling a hearing if and when the applicant
    filed proper material.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for the applicant argues that the effect of the refusal to schedule the motion
    finally determines the issue because the properties subject to the writs
    are to be sold on November 25, 2008.  As a result, he submits that this court
    should treat Campbell J.’s order as final and assume jurisdiction over the
    proceeding.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    do not accept this argument.  Assuming that the lands are to be sold on November
    25, 2008, it is not Campbell J.’s order that determines that the sale may
    proceed.  Rather, it is the applicant’s failure to pursue her case in an
    appropriate manner that will result in the sale going ahead without a hearing
    on the application required for a stay.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    it is important to consider the applicant’s motion against the background
    of what has occurred in this case.  In 2004, the applicant was convicted
    of fraud.  Her appeal to this court and her application for leave to appeal
    to the Supreme Court of Canada were dismissed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent, Bank of Montreal, sued the applicant for the same fraud which
    led to her conviction and obtained summary judgment on the basis of the criminal
    conviction.  The applicant appealed.  On her appeal, she argued, among other
    things, that the judgment should be set aside because her civil counsel rendered
    ineffective assistance on the summary judgment motion by failing to raise
    the alleged ineffective assistance of her counsel in the criminal proceedings
    both at trial and on appeal.  She tendered fresh evidence to support her
    arguments.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    dismissing the appeal on January 25, 2008, this court observed:</p>
  <p>To put these allegations in context, the appellant has made similar allegations
    against virtually every one of the very long list of lawyers who have represented
    her in these proceedings.  …  In the end, this appeal invites this court
    to allow the re-litigation not only of the summary judgment motion but also
    of the appeal from conviction and of the criminal trial itself.  To do so
    would be to permit an abuse of process.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    applicant’s application for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada
    was dismissed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    applicant’s request to stay the execution of the writs is premised solely
    on a successful challenge to her criminal conviction.  In furtherance of
    that challenge, she has been proposing, for at least a year now, to launch
    an application in this court to reopen the conviction based on new evidence
    relating to the ineffective assistance of her counsel in the criminal proceedings.  To
    date, she has not done so.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    Campbell J. correctly pointed out, there was no material before him upon
    which the order the applicant was seeking could possibly be made.  In these
    circumstances, I see no basis for this court to stay the execution of the
    writs.  This motion is, therefore, dismissed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Costs
    of the motion are fixed in the amount of $5,000, inclusive of disbursements
    and GST.  I am not prepared to order the costs be paid by Mr. Barnwell personally.  While
    it is apparent from this endorsement that I consider the steps that he has
    taken to have been ill-conceived, I am not satisfied this is a case that
    warrants costs against a solicitor.  </p>
