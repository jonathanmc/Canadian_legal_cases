style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    the conclusion of oral argument, I dismissed the motion with reasons to follow.  These
    are those reasons.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    history of the litigation can be summarized as follows.  In February 2008,
    the plaintiffs (respondents) obtained a default judgment granting them possession
    of the property in dispute.  The plaintiffs alleged that the property, a
    residence, was owned by the estate and the defendants (appellants) were unlawfully
    living there free of charge. They had apparently taken up residence there
    while Mr. Fiala was alive and would not leave when asked to do so by his
    daughter after his death.  The plaintiffs obtained a writ of possession on
    March 31, 2008.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    defendants moved to set aside the default judgment and the writ of possession.  On
    July 23, 2008, Langdon J. adjourned the motion on terms.  These terms required
    the defendants to make certain monthly payments and to pay certain expenses
    referable to the property.  In the ensuing months, the defendants did not
    comply with this order, although they did make the required payment in August.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    some unexplained reason, the defendants moved <i>ex parte</i> in August 2008
    before Murray J. for a stay of the writ of possession.  He granted that order.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    September 11, 2008, the plaintiffs moved for a fresh writ of possession based
    on non-payment of the monies ordered by Langdon J.  Corkey J. adjourned the
    motion to September 18, 2008 at the defendants’ request.  He ordered that
    the defendants pay costs fixed at $2,400.  Those costs have not been paid.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    September 18, 2008, Bellegham J. made an order dismissing the defendants’ motion
    for a variation of the terms of the order made by Langdon J. and an order
    granting the plaintiffs’ motion for a fresh writ of possession.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>None
    of the above orders are under appeal. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    October 8, 2008, the defendants moved <i>ex parte</i> for a stay of the writ
    of possession or alternatively for an order restoring possession of the property
    to them.  When Quigley J. heard the motion, the defendants were no longer
    in possession of the property.  On this motion, the defendants argued for
    the first time that they were in a landlord/tenant relationship with the
    defendants.  Throughout the prior proceedings, the defendants had claimed
    that they were the owners of the property which had been held in trust for
    them first by Mr. Fiala and subsequently by his estate.  Quigley J. found
    no merit to the claim that a landlord/tenant relationship existed and dismissed
    the defendants’ motion to stay enforcement of the writ of possession.  This
    order is under appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    plaintiffs subsequently moved <i>ex parte</i> for an order directing the
    defendants to remove their personal possessions from the property.  Quigley
    J. adjourned this motion on terms.  One of the terms required the defendants
    to vacate the property by November 8, 2008.  This order is under appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    November 13, 2008, the plaintiffs brought the motion initially heard by Quigley
    J. back on with notice to the defendants.  The defendants had not removed
    their personal property from the residence.  O’Connor J. ordered that the
    contents of the residence were declared abandoned and that the plaintiffs
    could seize and dispose of those contents.  He stayed the order until November
    20, 2008, presumably to give the defendants one more opportunity to remove
    their personal property.  The order of O’Connor J. is not under appeal.  In
    the course of oral argument, it became clear that the defendants are in fact
    seeking a stay of that order as well.  Although this court has no jurisdiction
    to stay an order that is not under appeal, I will proceed on the basis that,
    if necessary, the defendants would file a further notice of appeal from the
    order of O’Connor J.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    this motion, the defendants seek:</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>an
    order that possession of the premises be immediately returned to them;  and</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>an
    order staying any further action by the plaintiffs in respect of the property.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    relief sought goes far beyond a stay of the orders under appeal.  The defendants
    seek a mandatory injunction restoring possession of the property to them.  They
    have been out of the residence since October 8, 2008, before the orders under
    appeal were made.  I question whether I have the jurisdiction to make the
    order requested by the defendants.  I need not decide the jurisdictional
    question, however, as I am satisfied that the motion fails on its merits
    even if I do have the requisite jurisdiction.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    their notice of a motion, the defendants suggest that the orders under appeal
    are automatically stayed by virtue of rule 63.01(3).  I disagree.  The orders
    under appeal were not made under the <i>Tenant Protection Act</i> <i>1997</i> and
    were not orders “declaring a tenancy agreement terminated or evicting a person”.  The
    orders were made in the context of the enforcement of a judgment granting
    the plaintiffs possession of the property.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    defendants also ask the court to exercise its discretion and stay the orders
    under appeal (and the order of O’Connor J.) pursuant to rule 63.02(1).  The
    three-pronged test used in exercising the discretion to stay an order pending
    appeal is well known.  The defendants must satisfy me that there is a serious
    issue to be decided on the appeal, that immediate compliance with the order
    under appeal would cause irreparable harm to the defendants and that the
    balance of convenience favours a stay.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    defendants have not convinced me that they has a serious issue to be addressed
    on the appeal.  In my view, in the context of an appeal, a
    “serious issue” is a ground of appeal that has a reasonable prospect of success.  Certainly,
    the defendants need not convince me they will win the appeal, or even that
    they will probably win the appeal.  They must, however, satisfy me that they
    have some reasonable prospect of success.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    only argument made by counsel before me is based on the contention that the
    defendants were in a landlord/tenant relationship with the plaintiffs and
    that consequently the Superior Court had no jurisdiction to make the orders
    it did.  Counsel also submits that the plaintiffs have not complied with
    any of the requirements of the <i>Residential Tenancies Act</i> relating
    to the eviction of residential tenants.  The appellants rely on a notice
    of eviction apparently served on them in August 2008 by Ms. Fiala as proof
    of the landlord/tenant relationship.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Quigley
    J. rejected, in strong terms, the assertion that the appellants were in a
    landlord/tenant relationship with the respondents.  He observed that until
    October 2008, the appellants had insisted that they were owners of the property.  The
    material before Quigley J. offers no explanation for this radical change
    in position.  Indeed, the claim that a landlord/tenant relationship exists
    is based entirely on a single sentence in the affidavit of Andrew Louis Hamilton.  Quigley
    J. was satisfied that the defendants’ attempt to assert a landlord/tenant
    relationship was a last ditch effort to avoid enforcement of the writ of
    possession.  In his view, it had no air of reality.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Despite
    counsel’s submissions, I can see no reasonable possibility that counsel could
    convince this court that Quigley J. erred in rejecting the defendants’ attempt
    to recast the nature of the relationship to avoid enforcement of the writ
    of possession.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    defendants did not clear the first of the three hurdles standing between
    them and the relief they seek on this motion. Consequently, I dismissed the
    motion. As indicated in the endorsement, the plaintiffs are entitled to their
    costs fixed at $1,500, inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>
