  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Réno-Dépôt
    Inc. (“Réno”) entered into an agreement of purchase and sale with Wonderland
    Commercial Centre Inc. (“Wonderland”) in July 2000 to purchase the northern
    part of a plot of land in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    London,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario, owned by Wonderland.  The parties’ common intention was for Réno
    to construct a retail home and garden supply store on the northern part of
    the land, while Wonderland would commercially develop the southern portion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    agreement contained a number of conditions precedent to be performed by Wonderland
    prior to closing, including: rezoning of the land; obtaining site approval
    for the entire property from the city of London; and, the execution of an
    additional agreement between the parties for the development and operation
    of their respective portions of the property.  This agreement, the Reciprocal
    Enforcement Agreement (the “REA”), was executed on February 6, 2001, and
    provided that the first party to begin development on its property could,
    on notice, perform construction on the other party’s land and obtain reimbursement
    for such work.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Réno
    was first to start construction.  Wonderland has yet to begin construction.  In
    January 2001, Réno advised Wonderland that a minor change to the size of
    the building it intended to build would be necessary.  Wonderland gave its
    approval and the parties executed the REA.  Réno then incurred expenses in
    developing Wonderland’s property and, as contemplated by the REA, sought
    reimbursement from Wonderland.  When Wonderland refused to pay, Réno brought
    an action against it for damages for breach of contract.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Wonderland
    initially defended the action on the basis that Réno had fundamentally breached
    the agreement by making changes to the site plan without its approval.  Later,
    Wonderland amended its statement of defence and counterclaim to allege that
    Réno had made fraudulent misrepresentations to induce it to enter into the
    REA; it sought rescission or damages for misrepresentation or fraud.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the trial judge noted, Wonderland’s main complaint related to the removal
    and/or relocation of 27 parking spaces.  Wonderland said that Réno must have
    known about the changes to the parking spaces in January 2001 when it told
    Wonderland only that it would make minor changes to the size of its building.  However,
    the trial judge found that Réno had not made a false misrepresentation because,
    at the time the representation was made, Réno was not aware that reconfiguration
    of the building would cause a relocation of the parking spaces.  Thus, according
    to the findings of the trial judge, the representation was true when it was
    made.  The trial judge also found that there had been no detrimental reliance
    and no timely repudiation on the part of Wonderland.  He further held that
    there had been no breach of contract and, even if there had been, that Wonderland’s
    damages were “so speculative and tenuous as to merit little consideration”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge awarded Réno damages of approximately $480,000 plus interest
    for breach of contract.  Without hearing submissions on the matter of costs,
    he ordered that Réno was to have its costs on a substantial indemnity basis
    because Wonderland had maintained claims of fraud and dishonesty.  The trial
    judge then heard submissions on the quantum of costs and awarded Réno costs
    of approximately $384,000 based on a substantial indemnity scale throughout
    the proceedings. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Wonderland
    appeals both the decision below and the costs award.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    essence of the appeal on the merits is that the trial judge erred in his
    factual determinations.  Even if the court were persuaded that the trial
    judge misapprehended the evidence in finding that Wonderland either consented
    to the changes to the original site plan, or waived its right to enforce
    its contractual remedies, Wonderland did not prove damages flowing from the
    alleged breach.  Accordingly, there is no basis for interfering with the
    decision below.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    respect of the costs appeal, we begin by noting that it is an error in law
    to fail to provide counsel with the opportunity to make submissions regarding
    the scale of costs before deciding that matter: see <i>Metzler  v. Shier</i>,
    [2002] O.J. No. 3609 (C.A.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    said that, we are of the view that an award of costs on a substantial indemnity
    basis was warranted but only from the point in time when allegations of fraud
    and dishonesty were made.  Those allegations were made when the pleadings
    were amended in May 2006.  While Réno is entitled to costs on a substantial
    indemnity basis from May 2006 forward, it is entitled only to costs on a
    partial indemnity basis prior to that date.  Accordingly, a reduction in
    the costs award is necessary.  The parties have agreed that the quantum of
    such a reduction is $48,225 plus G.S.T.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the appeal is allowed in part.  Paragraph one of the judgment on costs dated
    November 6, 2007 is varied so that the costs payable by Wonderland to Réno
    are reduced by the sum of $48,225 plus G.S.T.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Costs
    of the appeal to the respondent fixed at $7200 all inclusive.</p>
