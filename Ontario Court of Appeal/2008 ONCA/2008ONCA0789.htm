    under OHSA as a result of an injury sustained by one of Blenkhorn’s workers
    in a workplace accident at the airport.  A justice of the peace accepted
    the appellants’ contention that the charges should be quashed on constitutional
    grounds.  She held that the appellants’

    to continue until at least 2020.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    1997, the GTAA and the Ontario Ministry of Labour came to an understanding
    regarding the application of OHSA.   The Ministry agreed not to enforce OHSA
    against the GTAA and the GTAA agreed that OHSA would apply to contractors
    doing construction on behalf of the GTAA at Pearson.  The GTAA also agreed
    to cooperate with the Ministry by allowing OHSA inspectors to have access
    to the airport.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    May 13, 2002, a worker employed by Blenkhorn was seriously injured in a fall
    at a construction site at the airport.  Ontario Ministry of Labour officials
    investigated and subsequently laid charges against EllisDon and its employee,
    Jason Orzechowski, as well as Blenkhorn and its employees, Paul and Daniel
    McCormick. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    accident occurred at the construction site of the Pier C, Terminal 3 expansion
    project.  The Pier C project involved the addition of eight new gates to
    Terminal 3 and formed part of the larger re-development project at Pearson.   EllisDon
    was the general contractor for the Pier C project pursuant to a lump sum
    contract awarded by the GTAA.  EllisDon contracted with another company which,
    in turn, subcontracted with Blenkhorn for the supply and erection of structural
    steel work.  EllisDon commenced construction on the Pier C project in November,
    2001 and completed the project at the end of May, 2004.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>EllisDon

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario and elsewhere.  At the time of the charges forming the subject of
    this appeal, Blenkhorn was a multi-trades contractor incorporated under the
    laws of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario.  It subsequently amalgamated with another company.  Both EllisDon
    and Blenkhorn employed workers unionized under the provincial labour relations
    regime.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    EllisDon and Blenkhorn have a long history of involvement in various construction
    projects at the airport.  EllisDon has been involved in various construction
    projects at Pearson since 1989.  EllisDon has developed considerable expertise
    and experience in airport construction and has also undertaken airport projects
    at several other Canadian cities.  Blenkhorn has been involved in significant
    aspects of the Pearson re-development project since 1999.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    EllisDon and Blenkhorn engage in a wide variety of construction projects.  Between
    2001 and 2004, both companies were involved in a number of construction projects
    outside of airport construction.  The justice of the peace found that
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Pearson
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Airport work performed by EllisDon amounted to between 3 and 15% of its operations
    as a whole and that performed by Blenkhorn amounted to approximately 29%
    of its entire operations.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Neither
    EllisDon nor Blenkhorn formed a separate unit or division for the purposes
    of the Pier C project or for airport work in general.  However, both EllisDon
    and Blenkhorn employed individuals, including the individual appellants,
    who specialized in airport development, and both companies maintained site
    offices to administer their work at Pearson.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
    the airport was operating as the Pier C project proceeded, extensive planning
    and coordination was required to ensure that the construction work did not
    interfere with the operation of the airport.  The GTAA assumed responsibility
    for this coordination and reserved the right to direct EllisDon and Blenkhorn
    on matters such as hours of work, scheduling and access to specific areas
    of the airport. </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    justice of the peace held that the work performed by the appellants for the
    GTAA was of a vital, essential, an integral nature to the operation of the
    airport as it could not be done without extensive involvement, supervision
    and coordination with the GTAA and other federal entities.  She found that
    the work was so intertwined with the operation of the airport that the appellants
    had been elevated into the federal sphere. </p>

    application judge held that the justice of the peace had erred by focusing
    only the work done by EllisDon and Blenkhorn at the airport as distinct from
    their operations as a whole.  The application judge also concluded that the
    work done by the appellants was not physically, operationally or functionally
    integrated with the operation of the airport.  She concluded that as the
    work being done by the appellants was not vital, essential or integral to
    the continued operation of the GTAA, the appellants were subject to OHSA.  She
    therefore quashed the decision of the justice of the peace and sent the matter

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    federal government has exclusive legislative authority with respect to aeronautics
    by virtue of its residual power under s. 91 of the <i>Constitution Act, 1867 </i>to
    make laws for the “Peace, Order and good Government of Canada”: <i>Re Regulation
    and Control of Aeronautics in Canada</i>, [1932] A.C. 54 (P.C.).  Under s.
    92(10), the federal government also has exclusive jurisdiction in relation
    to “Works and Undertakings connecting the Province with any other or others
    of the Provinces, or extending beyond the Limits of the Province”.  Federal
    jurisdiction over aeronautics and federal works and undertakings is plainly
    engaged in relation to the GTAA: <i>Greater Toronto Airports Authority v.
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    Mississauga (City)</i> (2000), 50 O.R. (3d) 641 (
    <st1:country-region

      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [2001] 1 S.C.R. ix.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Provincial
    occupational health and safety legislation falls within s. 92(13) of the <i>Constitution
    Act, 1867</i>, which grants exclusive jurisdiction to the provinces over “Property
    and Civil Rights in the Province”.  OHSA is valid provincial legislation
    under this head of power.  As valid provincial legislation, OHSA may incidentally
    affect matters beyond provincial jurisdiction, including federally regulated
    undertakings such as the GTAA.  As a general rule, “merely incidental effects
    will not disturb the constitutionality of an otherwise <i>intra vires </i>law” and
    validly enacted provincial laws apply to everyone in the province: see <i>e.g. Global
    Securities Corp. v.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    British Columbia (Securities Commission)</i>, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 494, at para.

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    general rules are subject, however, to the doctrine of interjurisdictional
    immunity.  The doctrine is based on principle that the “classes of subject” in
    ss. 91 and 92 must be assured “a basic, minimum and unassailable content” immune
    from the application of legislation enacted by the other level of government: <i>Canadian
    Western Bank v. Alberta</i>, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. <span lang=FR-CA>33; <i>Bell
    Canada v. Québec (Commission de la santé et de la sécurité du travail)</i>,
    [1988] 1 S.C.R. 749, at p. 839.  </span>Although, in theory, the doctrine
    is reciprocal and applies to the benefit of both the provinces and the federal
    government, historically, “the jurisprudential application of the doctrine
    has produced somewhat “asymmetrical” results”: <i>Canadian Western Bank </i>at
    para. 35.<i>  </i>Thus, when the doctrine is successfully invoked, provincial
    legislation is inapplicable or “read down” to the extent that it unacceptably
    intrudes upon a protected “core” of federal jurisdiction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Canadian
      Western Bank</i>, the Supreme Court of Canada refined the test for the
      level of intrusion necessary to trigger the doctrine of interjurisdictional
      immunity.  The Court held at para. 48: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is when the adverse impact of a law adopted
    by one level of government increases in severity from “affecting” to “impairing”
    (without necessarily “sterilizing” or “paralyzing”) that the “core” competence
    of the other level of government (or the vital or essential part of an undertaking
    it duly constitutes) is placed in jeopardy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    issue on this appeal is whether the application of OHSA to the appellants
    would impair the protected core of federal jurisdiction in relation to the
    GTAA.  </p>
  <h3 style='page-break-after:avoid'><i><span style='font-weight:normal'>(2)       The

    test for determining whether the appellants’
    activities at Pearson render them subject to OHSA is set out by Dickson J.

    (“<i>Northern Telecom No. 1</i>”), at p. 132:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>First, one must begin with the operation which
    is at the core of the federal undertaking.  Then the courts look at the particular
    subsidiary operation engaged in by the employees in question.  The court

    to the core federal undertaking, the necessary relationship being variously

    J. summarized six constitutional principles, derived from <i>Construction
    Montcalm Inc. v. Min. Wage Com</i>., [1979] 1 S.C.R. 754, to frame and guide
    this analysis at p. 132:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1) Parliament has no authority over labour relations
    as such nor over the terms of a contract of employment; exclusive provincial
    competence is the rule.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2) By way of exception, however, Parliament may
    assert exclusive jurisdiction over these matters if it is shown that such
    jurisdiction is an integral part of its primary competence over some other
    single federal subject.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3) Primary federal competence over a given subject
    can prevent the application of provincial law relating to labour relations
    and the conditions of employment but only if it is demonstrated that federal
    authority over these matters is an integral element of such federal competence.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(4) Thus, the regulation of wages to be paid by
    an undertaking, service or business, and the regulation of its labour relations,
    being related to an integral part of the operation of the undertaking, service
    or business, are removed from provincial jurisdiction and immune from the
    effect of provincial law if the undertaking, service or business is a federal
    one.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(5) The question whether an undertaking, service
    or business is a federal one depends on the nature of its operation.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(6) In order to determine the nature of the operation,
    one must look at the normal or habitual activities of the business as those
    of “a going concern”, without regard for exceptional or casual factors; otherwise,
    the Consti­tution could not be applied with any degree of continuity and
    regularity.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    central issues dividing the parties to this appeal can be distilled from
    these principles.  Is the relationship between the appellants’
    activities and the GTAA “vital”, “essential” or “integral” to the operation
    of the GTAA?  Is federal regulation of the safety of the working conditions
    of employees of EllisDon and Blenkhorn integral to federal competence over
    aeronautics?  The answer to these questions depends upon the nature of EllisDon
    and Blenkhorn’s operations – what are their normal or habitual activities
    as going concerns – and the relationship between their operations and the
    operation of the GTAA.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dickson
    J. also outlined, at p. 135, the nature of the factual inquiry to resolve
    these issues.  That test, as applied to this case, calls for inquiry into
    the following matters:</p>
  <h3><span
style='font-weight:normal'>(i)        the general nature of EllisDon and Blenkhorn’s
      operations as going concerns and, in particular, the role of those working
      at Pearson within their operations;</span></h3>
  
  <h3><span
style='font-weight:normal'>(ii)       the nature of the corporate relationship
      between EllisDon and Blenkhorn and the GTAA;</span></h3>
  <h3><span
style='font-weight:normal'>(iii)     the importance of the work done by EllisDon
      and Blenkhorn for the GTAA as compared with other customers;</span></h3>
  
  <h3><span
style='font-weight:normal'>(iv)      the physical and operational connection
      between the appellants’ work and the GTAA and, in particular, the extent
      of the involvement of the appellants’ work at the airport in the operation
      and institution of the GTAA as an operating system.</span></h3>
  <h3><i><span style='font-weight:normal'>(3)       Application of the test</span></i></h3>
 
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge correctly identified this test and I now turn to the manner
    in which it should be applied. </p>
  <h3><i><span style='font-weight:normal'>(i)        EllisDon and Blenkhorn as
        going concerns</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    justice of the peace focused on the appellants’ particular work at the airport
    rather than on their normal or habitual activities.  The appellants say that
    this was the correct approach and that the application judge erred by insisting
    that the issue turned on the nature of the entire range of their normal or
    habitual activities.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    submission seems to me to be fundamentally at odds with the authorities.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Construction
      Montcalm</i>,<i> </i>the court held that provincial minimum wage legislation
      did apply to the workers of a contractor engaged in the construction of
      an airport. There, as here, the construction company was involved in a
      variety of projects and there was no discrete unit or division within the
      company devoted solely to the project. Writing for the majority, Beetz
      J. held, at p. 776, that to apply federal jurisdiction in such a situation &ldquo;would
      be to disregard the elements of continuity which are to be found in construction
      undertakings and to focus on casual or temporary factors&rdquo;, contrary
      to established principles. He continued:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Building contractors and their employees frequent­ly
    work successively or simultaneously on several projects which have little
    or nothing in common.  They may be doing construction work on a runway, on
    a highway, on sidewalks, on a yard, for the public sector, federal or provincial,
    or for the private sector.  One does not say of them that they are in the
    business of building runways because for a while they happen to be building
    a runway and that they enter into the business of building highways because
    they thereafter begin to do construc­tion work on a section of a provincial
    turnpike. <i>Their ordinary business is the business of building. What they
    build is accidental.  And there is noth­ing specifically federal about their
    ordinary business. </i>[Emphasis added.] </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the respondent that one cannot ignore the fact that most of what
    the appellants do has nothing to do with the GTAA.  EllisDon and Blenkhorn
    concede that the justice of the peace did not make a factual finding that
    their airport operations could or should be considered to be functionally
    separate from the rest of their operations.  I agree with the respondent
    that such a finding is, in any event, not available on the record.  Despite
    their long history of working on various airport construction projects, neither
    EllisDon nor Blenkhorn created definable, discrete divisions or units exclusively
    involved in airport construction.  In addition, they employed workers unionized
    under the provincial labour relations regime and retained the liberty to
    move those workers on and off the airport site as the demands of their overall
    operations required.  As the application judge observed at para. 21 of her
    reasons, “the airport workers in this case are not an entity separate from
    those working on other company projects and cannot be divided from those
    other workers except in an artificial way.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is a very different situation than that existing in <i>Northern Telecom v. <span
style='letter-spacing:-.2pt'>Communication Workers</span>, </i>[1983] 1 S.C.R.
    733 (“<i>Northern Telecom No. 2</i>”), a case relied on by the appellants.  There,
    the issue was whether “<i>all the operations</i> relating to installers of
    Telecom carried on east of a vertical line through Brighton in Eastern Ontario” (emphasis
    added) were governed by federal or provincial jurisdiction with respect to
    labour relations: <i>Northern Telecom No. 2</i> at p. 737.  That discrete,
    clearly defined and functionally separate unit devoted 80% of its time to
    the installation of equipment for
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Bell, a federal undertaking.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    the nature of the corporate appellants’
    operations, I fail to see how exempting the appellants from the uniform operation
    of provincial labour and workplace safety legislation would be consistent
    with the coherent application of constitutional principles.  They would be
    subjected on a haphazard basis to either federal or provincial authority
    as they came to and left the GTAA.  Beetz J.’s comments in <i>Construction
    Montcalm</i>, at p. 776, are apposite:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>a worker whose job it is to pour cement would from
    day to day be shifted from federal to provincial jurisdiction for the purposes
    of union membership, certification, collective agreement and wages, because
    he pours cement one day on a runway and the other on a provincial highway.  I
    cannot be persuaded that the Constitution was meant to apply in such a disinte­grating
    fashion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Subjecting
    EllisDon and Blenkhorn’s workers one day to regulation under federal labour
    standards and the next day to provincial labour standards would ignore Dickson
    J.’s caution in <i>Northern Telecom No. 1</i>, at p. 132, that if one does
    not look “at the normal or habitual activities of the business as those of ‘a
    going concern’, without regard for exceptional or casual factors”, the Consti­tution
    will “not be applied with any degree of continuity and regularity.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would add that, contrary to the appellants’
    submission, application of this principle to the present case does not amount
    to deciding a constitutional case on considerations of efficiency contrary
    to the admonition in <i>Ontario Hydro v. Ontario (Labour Relations Board),</i> [1993]
    3 S.C.R. 327.  That case involved divided jurisdiction over a single enterprise
    where different rules applied to different employees, not different rules
    applying to the same employees as they move from one job to the next.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    conclude that the application judge did not err by focusing on the appellants’ overall
    operations and by concluding that the first factor in <i>Northern Telecom
    No. 1</i> points in favour of provincial jurisdiction. </p>
  <h3><i><span style='font-weight:normal'>(ii)       Nature of the corporate
        relationship</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is no corporate relationship between EllisDon and Blenkhorn on the one hand,
    and the GTAA on the other.  While both companies made a series of successful
    contract bids for projects at Pearson, neither had an ongoing legal relationship
    with the GTAA or any guarantee that future bids would be accepted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    situation is in marked contrast to that existing in <i>Northern Telecom No.
    2</i> where
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    Bell
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    , the federal undertaking, controlled Telecom, the entity found to be subject
    to federal jurisdiction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    this factor weighs against federal jurisdiction and in favour of the application
    of OHSA to the appellants.</p>
  <h3><i><span style='font-weight:normal'>(iii)     Importance of the work done
        for the GTAA as compared with other customers</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    justice of the peace found that Pearson airport work amounted to between
    3 and 15% of EllisDon’s total construction work and about 29% of Blenkhorn’s
    work.  As the respondent points out, these percentages are significantly
    lower than those found to exist in cases where federal jurisdiction was upheld:
    100% in the “Stevedores’
    case” (<i>Validity and Applicability of the Industrial Relations and Disputes
    Investigation Act</i>, [1955] S.C.R. 529); 90% in the “letter carriers case” (<i>Reference
    re Minimum Wage Act (
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Saskatchewan)</i>, [1948] S.C.R. 248); and 80% in <i>Northern Telecom No.
    2</i>.  I note that in <i>Northern Telecom No. 2</i>, Dickson J. stated,
    at p. 774, that the case was “very close to the boundary line between federal
    and provincial jurisdiction”.</p>

style='color:#3A3A3A'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This

    in favour of provincial jurisdiction.</p>
  <h3 style='page-break-after:avoid'><i><span style='font-weight:

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is common ground that the degree of physical and operational connection between
    EllisDon and Blenkhorn on the one hand, and the GTAA on the other, is a dominant
    factor in determining whether there is an integral relationship between the
    appellants and the GTAA. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants submit that as the construction is being conducted alongside a
    functioning and operating airport, there must be extensive coordination with
    the GTAA in order to avoid interference with the airport’s normal activities.  They
    say that the application of provincial workplace safety legislation could,
    for example, allow the provincial authorities to shut down all or part of
    the airport to uphold provincial safety standards in the event of a serious
    accident. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents meet this submission as follows:
    “keeping out of the way” of the federal undertaking is distinct from – indeed
    the opposite of – being integrated in the operation of that federal undertaking.  Any
    incidental effect of the enforcement of provincial workplace safety standards
    on the operation of the airport, according to the respondent, is minimal
    and acceptable under the governing constitutional principles. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the respondent and see no error in the application judge’s conclusion
    that the degree of physical and operational integration between the appellants
    and the GTAA falls short of the degree required to invoke federal jurisdiction. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    accept that extensive coordination by the GTAA was required to accommodate
    the construction work since the project proceeded while the airport was operating.  However,
    coordination is not the same as integration.  The construction project proceeded
    beside, not as part of, the operating airport.  As the respondent argues,
    keeping out of the way of the operation of the airport is really the opposite
    of being integral to that operation.  The construction will facilitate the
    operation of the airport in the future once it is completed, but the construction
    work carried on by the appellants during the Pier C expansion project was
    quite separate and distinct from the operation of the airport.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, it is particularly telling that the GTAA, the very entity responsible
    for the operation of the airport, has agreed to accept the application of
    OHSA to all contractors, including EllisDon and Blenkhorn.  Surely if there
    were any serious threat, as the appellants submit, that busy-body provincial
    inspectors acting pursuant to provincial jurisdiction under OHSA would interfere
    in some way with the airport’s operations, the GTAA would have asserted interjurisdictional
    immunity.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    recognize, of course, that certain decisions in relation to airport construction
    fall within exclusive federal jurisdiction.  As this court held in <i>Toronto
    Airports Authority</i>,<i> </i>application of provincial regulations pertaining
    to building design, materials, and the alteration of buildings may invade
    the core of federal jurisdiction in relation to aeronautics.  Decisions relating
    to building design and materials, as the court held in <i>Construction Montcalm</i> at
    p. 771, “will be permanently reflected in the structure of the finished product” and
    will “have a direct effect upon its operational qualities, and, therefore,
    upon its suitability for the purposes of aeronautics”.  These matters are
    to be distinguished from the mode or manner of construction.  Again, to quote
    Beetz J. in <i>Construction Montcalm</i>, at p. 771: “the requirement that
    workers wear a protective helmet on all construction sites including the
    construction site of a new airport has everything to do with construction
    and with provincial safety regulations and nothing to do with aeronautics.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not agree that <i>Construction Montcalm</i> should be distinguished on
    the ground that in that case, the airport was not yet operational.  While
    working on the expansion of an existing and operating airport is bound to
    require a special level of coordination, here, as in <i>Construction Montcalm</i>,
    the safety standards imposed upon the appellants by OHSA have everything
    to do with construction and nothing to do with aeronautics.  </p>

    turn, finally, to the issue of whether the application judge applied the
    appropriate standard of review. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge found that the justice of the peace erred in: (1) defining
    the work done by the appellants in terms of work being done for the airport
    as distinct from the operations of each company as a going concern; and (2)
    concluding that the physical, operational and functional connection between
    the operation of each company and the federal undertaking made the former
    vital, essential and integral to the latter.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants submit that these were issues of mixed fact and law and that absent
    palpable and overriding error, the application judge had no right to interfere.  I
    disagree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to the first issue, the application judge identified a legal error:
    by focusing on the corporate appellants’ operations at the airport rather
    than on their overall operations, she held that the justice of the peace
    did not apply the correct constitutional test.  The standard of review is
    clearly correctness. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second issue involves the constitutional effect of the evidence.  I agree
    with the respondent that the appropriate standard of review on an application
    of this kind is correctness: see <i>R. v. Mercy Seafoods Ltd</i>., [2008]
    N.S.J. No. 315 (C.A.).  Any other standard would permit different results
    on the same facts, an intolerable result in the constitutional realm.  As
    stated in <i>Dunsmuir v.
