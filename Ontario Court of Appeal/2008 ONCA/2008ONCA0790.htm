    was in the throes of a bitter and prolonged civil war between Bosnian Serbs
    and Bosnian Muslims.  The war had a complicated and violent history.  Throughout,

    Treaty Organization (NATO), was deployed in

    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Bosnia</st1:country-region>
    and became involved with the Serbian war effort.  On May 26, 1995, Ribic
    and several companions took three unarmed UN military observers hostage at
    gunpoint in the Bosnian town of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Pale and used them as human shields by shackling them to Serbian ammunition
    bunkers that were the target of an ongoing NATO air strike.  During the initial
    hostage-taking, Ribic repeatedly threatened to kill the hostages if the NATO
    bombing did not stop.  The hostages were detained for almost three and a
    half weeks, until their negotiated release on June 18, 1995.  News of this
    shocking incident was rapidly broadcast around the world by the international
    media.  </p>

    February 17, 1999, Ribic was charged with four counts of hostage-taking in
    relation to two of the UN observers – one of whom is a Canadian citizen – under
    s. 279.1 of the <i>Criminal Code of Canada</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 (the
    Code).  Ribic was then residing in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Germany</st1:country-region>
    .  He was extradited and brought to

    first trial began in October 2002.  It ended on January 20, 2003 with the
    declaration of a mistrial.  On June 12, 2005, following a second trial before
    a judge and jury, Ribic was convicted of two counts of hostage-taking and,
    on September 14, 2005, was sentenced to three years imprisonment. </p>

    appeals his convictions.  He argues that the trial judge erred by ruling
    that some of the substantive defences advanced by the appellant should not
    have been put to the jury and that he further erred in his instructions on
    certain of the defences left with the jury for its consideration.  Ribic
    also contends that the trial judge erred by refusing to stay the prosecution
    on the grounds that Ribic’s rights under ss. 7 and 11(b) of the <i>Charter
    of Rights and Freedoms</i> to a fair trial, to make full answer and defence
    to the Crown’s case, and to trial within a reasonable time had been infringed.  For
    the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>

    contrast to UNPROFOR soldiers, who carried arms and lived in military compounds,
    the UN military observers worked in small teams in the region, living among

    1994 cessation of hostilities agreement between the Serbs and the Muslims
    expired in April of 1995.  By late May, the Serbian army had removed prohibited
    weapons from the UN collection points and both sides were engaged in armed
    hostilities from populated areas within the UN safe areas, including
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Sarajevo.  As a result, on May 24, 1995, General Smith issued the following
    blunt warning to both factions:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In view of these grave circumstances and with the
    intent of stabilizing the situation, all heavy weapons, as previously defined,
    are to cease firing and the four heavy weapons removed from the … Weapons
    Collections Points are to be returned 1200 hrs local time Thursday 25 May
    1995.  All remaining heavy weapons are to be clear of the Heavy Weapons Exclusion
    Zone or in Weapons Collection Points by 1200 hrs local time Friday 26 May
    1995.  Failure to comply with either deadline will result in the offending
    party or parties being attacked from the air.</p>

    May 25, when the Serbian army did not comply with the deadline for the ceasefire
    and the return of its heavy weapons to the UN collection points, NATO commenced
    an air strike on two Serbian ammunition bunkers in the Pale area.  At that
    time, a three-person UN military observer team, consisting of Captain Patrick
    Rechner
    – a Canadian and the leader of the team, Captain Oldrich Zidlik – a Czech
    officer, and Captain Pavel Teterevsky – a Russian officer, was stationed
    in Pale.  Rechner’s team lived with a Serbian family.  The team’s office
    was located in the garage of their host family’s home.</p>

    Sarajevo and other Bosnian towns, causing numerous civilian fatalities.  This
    prompted General Smith to issue a second stern warning to the Serbian army.  He
    wrote on May 25 to General Mladi<span style='"Times New Roman"'>&#263;</span>,
    stating:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I want to stress that this afternoon an air strike
    was executed on the ammunition storage site at PALE because the 4 heavy weapons
    had not been returned to their WCP’s [weapons collection points] by 1200
    hrs on 25 May 95.  Since then your forces have shelled in retaliation the
    Safe Areas of Sarajevo, Gorazde, Srebrenica,
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Tuzla and Bihac.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>These breaches of all the existing Agreements are
    taken very seriously.  The violations against safety of civilians and UN
    personnel will not be accepted.  You must understand that the failure to
    return the weapons and the subsequent shelling have taken the matter out
    of my hands; your forces must continue to expect NATO to react.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I remind you of the second deadline stated in my
    Warning of which you are very well aware, that will end tomorrow, 26 May
    95, at 1200 hrs.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    next morning, UN intelligence reports indicated that the Serbian army had
    still not complied with the UN demand for the return of the heavy weapons
    and was making no effort to remove its heavy weapons from the exclusion zones.  Accordingly,
    after a telephone discussion between Generals Smith and Mladi<span style='"Times New Roman"'>&#263;</span> failed
    to resolve the situation, NATO air strikes in Pale recommenced.</p>
  <h2>(2)       The Hostage-Taking</h2>

    about 10:00 a.m. on May 26, while the second round of NATO air strikes was
    in progress, two men armed with assault rifles entered the UN military observers’ office
    in Pale.  Zidlik and Rechner were in the building.  Teterevsky walked into
    the office shortly after the intruders’ arrival.  Rechner immediately telephoned
    the offices of the Serbian president and was informed that the intruders
    had been “sent officially”.  Shortly thereafter, the appellant and one or
    two companions arrived.  They wore camouflaged Serbian military uniforms
    and were armed with AK – 47 automatic assault rifles.  The appellant was
    also wearing a military helmet and, according to Rechner, was holding his
    weapon in a ready-to-fire position.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant quickly assumed control of the situation and demanded to be put
    in touch with General Smith.  He was connected by telephone with Major Guy
    Lavender, General Smith’s military assistant.  Throughout their ensuing discussion,
    the appellant repeatedly demanded of Lavender that the air strike be stopped,
    failing which the military observers would be killed.  According to Rechner,
    the appellant also said, “[F]or every bomb that now falls, one of the [observers]
    will be shot.”  Lavender confirmed that the appellant stated: “Unless you
    get General Smith on the phone, I’m going to kill the hostages that I’ve
    got here.”  When the appellant thereafter spoke directly with General Smith,
    he further threatened: “I’m telling you now that this bombing is to stop,
    otherwise I’m going to kill the hostages that I’ve taken”
    and “You listen to me, if this bombing doesn’t stop then these hostages are
    going to be killed.”  </p>

    Serbian soldiers soon arrived, including a man named “Srjan”, whom the appellant
    identified as his commander.  The UN observers were then handcuffed together,
    forced into their SUV and driven to the Serbian munitions depot near Pale.  When
    the hostages and their captors arrived at the depot, they encountered several
    civilians, one of whom attacked Rechner and, brandishing a pistol, threatened
    to kill all the hostages.  Zidlik said that when the appellant and his companions
    intervened and stopped the attack, they told the assailant: “We need them
    alive.  You don’t need to – we don’t – we don’t want them – we don’t want

    Serbians broke the lock on the depot gate with a hammer and chisel and drove
    the hostages into the compound.  <i>En route</i>, the appellant informed
    the UN military observers’ headquarters in Sarajevo by radio that the hostages
    were being taken to the bunkers and again threatened that if there was any
    more bombing, they would be killed.  Subsequently, when the appellant again
    contacted UN headquarters, he stated: “This is a BSA [Bosnian Serb-army]
    soldier.  Three UN observers are now at the site of the warehouse.  Any more
    bombing, they’ll be the first to go.  Understood?”  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    the NATO bombing continued unabated, the hostages were driven farther into
    the complex, towards the bunkers.  Once at the bunkers, Rechner and Teterevsky
    were handcuffed to lightning rods located outside the bunkers.  Zidlik was
    initially handcuffed to the main door of a bunker but was later moved, and
    handcuffed, at a different location.  A Polish officer from another UN observer
    team was handcuffed in front of a bunker that contained exploding ammunition.  The
    hostages were videotaped in these positions.  The videotape was given to
    a Serbian news service and was soon broadcast around the world by international
    media organizations.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant and his companions then abandoned the hostages, leaving them secured
    in the area of the bunkers while the bombing continued.  According to Rechner,
    before the appellant departed he told Rechner that: “As far as [Rechner]
    was concerned, he [the appellant] was never there.  That he didn’t exist.  That
    he …
    didn’t participate in the … [hostage taking].”</p>

    next day, Rechner was allowed to return to his office, guarded by the appellant
    and another Serbian soldier, to obtain supplies for his team.  The three
    men stopped to watch a CNN broadcast that included footage of the hostages
    and the appellant, as well as one of the radio transmissions in which the
    appellant had threatened the lives of the hostages.  While observing this
    broadcast, Rechner heard the appellant say, “I may as well rip up my Canadian
    passport.”</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    some point, NATO terminated the air strikes.  Nevertheless, Rechner and Zidlik
    remained captive at a Serbian military barracks, along with other detained
    UN observers, until their negotiated release on June 18, 1995.  It later
    emerged that their capture and detention were part of a much larger offensive
    by the Serbian army, in which about 350 UN personnel, including military
    observers, were taken hostage and used as human shields in various locations
    throughout Serbian-held territory.  The evidence at trial suggested that
    hostage-taking was a tactic known to be employed by the Serbian army.</p>

    appellant’s first trial began on October 7, 2002 before Cunningham J. of
    the Superior Court of Justice.  The Crown called six witnesses over eight
    days.  On October 23, 2002, at the close of the Crown’s case, the defence
    sought to call as witnesses two former members of the Canadian Armed Forces
    who had served in

    B – was a forward air controller who engaged in intelligence-gathering, helped
    select bombing targets and assisted in guiding NATO aircraft to identified
    targets.  Neither of these individuals was present during the hostage-taking
    incident.  As the process that was used to obtain the evidence of these witnesses

    the Attorney General of Canada in accordance with s. 38.01(1) of the CEA,
    the Attorney General declined to authorize the disclosure of Witness A’s
    and B’s information.  The appellant then applied to the Federal Court for
    an order authorizing Witnesses A and B to testify without restriction at
    his criminal trial and permitting the entirety of their proposed evidence
    to be disclosed.  The Attorney General opposed this application and moved

    A.C.J. of the Federal Court, dated November 15, 2002 (the Disclosure Process).  The
    witnesses were questioned under oath <i>in camera</i> by counsel designated
    by the Attorney General for that purpose (not Crown counsel in the appellant’s
    criminal trial), in accordance with questions devised by the appellant’s

  <h2>            (1)       Trial Judge’s Charge on Substantive Defences</h2>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    trial, the appellant argued that the air of reality threshold was met for
    the defences provided under both ss. 27 and 41(1) of the Code.  The trial
    judge rejected this argument, reasoning as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[T]he real context of the case is the taking of
    hostages in a territory torn by civil war and the use of property by the
    Serb revolutionary forces in armed conflict with the forces of what remained
    of the legitimate government of the territory.  I see no air of reality in
    those other two statutory defences, contem-plating, as the one does [s. 41],
    peaceable possession of property and as the other does [s. 27], preventing
    the commission of an offence, I see no appropriate role in the trial for
    the civil law concept of trespass upon private property in this civil war
    context and I also see no utility or value in considering the intervention
    by NATO and the United Nations, given their mandate to establish a peace
    in Bosnia and enforce it, as an offence, which could be lawfully repelled
    by the use of force.</p>

    the ss. 27 and 41(1) defences considered and decided by the jury.  I disagree.  </p>
  <h2><i><u>Governing Principles</u></i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    air of reality test contemplates that an accused is entitled to have all
    defences put to the jury that are realistically available on the evidence.  However, “a
    defence should be put to a jury if and only if there is an evidential foundation
    for it”: <i>R. v. Cinous</i>, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 50, <i>per</i> McLachlin
    C.J. and Bastarache J.  See also <i>R. v. Gunning</i>, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 627,
    at para. 29, <i>per</i> Charron J.  Indeed, “[a] trial judge has a positive
    duty to keep from the jury defences lacking an evidential foundation”: <i>Cinous</i> at
    para. 51, <i>per</i> McLachlin C.J. and Bastarache J.  The air of reality
    test applies to all defences (<i>Cinous</i> at paras. 57 and 82) and to all
    requisite elements of a defence.  Thus, if evidential support for a necessary
    element of a defence is lacking, the air of reality test will not be met.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this case, the appellant requested the trial judge to charge the jury on
    multiple theories of self-defence.  The trial judge, therefore, was obliged
    to consider whether, on the evidence, there was an air of reality to each
    of the defences advanced by the appellant.  In their joint reasons in <i>Cinous</i>,
    at paras. 52-54, McLachlin C.J. and Bastarache J. explained the air of reality
    test and a trial judge’s task in applying this test to a proposed defence:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The air of reality test is concerned only with whether
    or not a putative defence should be “<i>put in play</i>”, that is, submitted
    to the jury for consideration. </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In applying the air of reality test, a trial judge
    considers the totality of the evidence, and assumes the evidence relied upon
    by the accused to be true. … The evidential foundation can be indicated by
    evidence emanating from the examination in chief or cross-examination of
    the accused, of defence witnesses, or of Crown witnesses.  It can also rest
    upon the factual circumstances of the case or from any other evidential source
    on the record.  There is no requirement that the evidence be adduced by the
    accused.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The threshold determination by the trial judge is
    not aimed at deciding the substantive merits of the defence.  That question
    is reserved for the jury. … The trial judge does not make determinations
    about the credibility of witnesses, weigh the evidence, make findings of
    fact, or draw determinate factual inferences. … Nor is the air of reality
    test intended to assess whether the defence is likely, unlikely, somewhat
    likely, or very likely to succeed at the end of the day.  The question for
    the trial judge is whether the evidence discloses a real issue to be decided
    by the jury, and not how the jury should ultimately decide the issue.  [Citations

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Subsequently,
    in <i>R. v. Fontaine</i>, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 702, the Supreme Court of
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    revisited the air of reality test.  Justice Fish, writing for the court,
    described the underlying rationale for the test, at paras. 48 and 58:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Under our system of trial by judge and jury, the
    judge decides all questions of law and delimits the issues of fact to be
    considered and determined by the jury.  To avoid manifest unfairness and
    undue confusion, no issues will be put to the jury in the absence of a sufficient
    evidential foundation.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:
center'>….</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>This requirement of a sufficient evidential foundation
    aims primarily to avoid wrongful convictions and unwarranted acquittals,
    while at the same time leaving it to the jury to discharge the responsibilities
    that are by law within its exclusive domain.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Justice
    Fish also addressed the application of the air of reality test to affirmative
    defences, stating at para. 56: “[t]here must be evidence in the record upon
    which a properly instructed jury, acting judicially, could entertain a reasonable
    doubt as to the defence that has been raised.”  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Justice
    Fish then added, at paras. 71-74:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The operative question is sometimes said to be whether
    there is any evidence “upon which a properly instructed jury acting reasonably
    could acquit <u>if it believed the evidence to be true</u>”.  (<i>Cinous</i>,
    at para. 65.) </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>This formulation of the test signifies that the
    trial judge, in determining whether a defence is in play, must <u>assume</u> the
    truth of the evidence that tends to support it, leaving the reliability,
    credibility and weight of that evidence to be determined by the jury. </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It was not meant to suggest that the evidential
    burden for all defences will be discharged only if the relevant evidence <u>must
    be believed</u> in order for the defence to succeed.  As McLachlin J. explained
    in her dissent in <i>R. v. S. (W.D.)</i>, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 521, at p. 543,
    an accused is entitled to be acquitted on the basis of exculpatory evidence
    that the jury does not reject, but either accepts or about which it is undecided. </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In short, as regards all affirmative defences, I
    think it preferable to say that the evidential burden will be discharged
    where there is some evidence that puts the defence “in play”: see <i>Cinous</i>,
    at para. 52.  And the defence will be in play whenever a properly instructed
    jury could reasonably, on account of that evidence, conclude in favour of
    the accused.  [Emphasis in original.]</p>

    my opinion, the s. 27 defence did not merit being left with the jury on the
    facts of this case.  This defence, viewed in its proper context, applies
    to force used in general law enforcement: <i>R. v. Hebert</i>, [1996] 2 S.C.R.
    272, at para. 12.  To invoke s. 27 of the Code, the appellant was required
    to point to some evidence on the basis of which the jury could have a doubt
    as to whether the appellant believed, on reasonable grounds, that in taking
    the UN observers hostage at gunpoint and forcibly confining them at the ammunition
    bunkers to serve as human shields against the NATO air strikes, he was preventing
    the commission of an offence. </p>

    for the appellant suggested at trial and, in effect, again asserts before

    was no evidence in this case to support this proposition.  On the contrary,
    Rechner’s evidence of the appellant’s actions told strongly against the suggestion
    that, in acting as he did, the appellant believed that he was acting to prevent
    the commission of an offence.  Consider that before abandoning the hostages
    at the ammunition bunkers, the appellant exhorted Rechner to forget that
    he had ever seen him.  Consider also Rechner’s testimony that when the appellant
    viewed the CNN broadcast, he observed that he might as well “rip up [his]
    Canadian passport”.  This evidence cut against the suggestion that there
    was a basis on which the jury could find or at least have a reasonable doubt
    concerning whether the appellant had a reasonable belief that his actions

    343, this court, citing <i>R. v. Born with a Tooth</i> (1992), 76 C.C.C.
    (3d) 169 (Alta. C.A.), held that there are four elements of the s. 41(1)
    defence: (i) the accused must have been in possession of land; (ii) his possession
    must have been peaceable; (iii) the victim of the assault must have been
    a trespasser; and (iv) the force used to eject the trespasser must have been

style='"Times New Roman"'>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    four reasons, I am persuaded that the trial judge did not err in holding
    that the s. 41(1) defence lacked the air of reality required to leave it
    with the jury.  First, there is some merit to the Crown’s assertion that
    the evidence at trial failed to establish or at least to raise a reasonable
    doubt as to whether the appellant and his companions were in possession of
    the targeted munitions complex and the ammunition bunkers.  Recall that they
    gained entry to the facility by breaking the lock on the depot gate.  At
    the very least, there was no evidence that the appellant himself had any
    connection with the ammunition bunkers or the munitions depot, any right
    to be in possession of them, or any control over them.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    and more importantly, even if the actual occupation of the munitions depot
    and the ammunition bunkers by the appellant and his associates met the requirement
    of possession under s. 41(1), there was no basis on which the jury could
    have a reasonable doubt that there was “peaceable”
    possession as contemplated by that provision.  In <i>George</i>, at paras.
    41-42, this court accepted that “peaceable” possession under s. 41(1) means
    possession that is “not seriously challenged by others” and that any challenge
    to the possession should be “unlikely to lead to violence”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>But,
    as the munitions depot and the ammunition bunkers were the target of NATO
    bombings, the “possession” of this property by the Serbs was not possession
    unchallenged by others and unlikely to lead to violence.  I agree with the
    Crown’s submission that, viewed against the backdrop of a fierce civil war
    and intense fighting over Bosnian territory, the evidence at trial was not
    capable of leaving the jury with a reasonable doubt that the appellant or
    the Serbian army was in “peaceable” possession of the munitions complex and
    the bunkers.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    conclusion is sufficient to dispose of the appellant’s argument concerning
    s.&nbsp;41(1).  But there are additional impediments to his attempt to rely
    on the s. 41(1) defence.  The actions of the UN and NATO in initiating the
    air strikes were sanctioned by the UN Security Council, acting under the
    authority of the UN Charter, to which
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    is a signatory.  In his communications on May 24 and 25, 1995, General Smith
    clearly indicated that any air strikes would be for the purpose of enforcing
    the UN designated safe areas, as authorized by UN Security Council Resolution
    836.  As I have said, there was no evidence at trial that the NATO bombings
    were illegal.  Thus, the third prerequisite to reliance on the s.&nbsp;41(1)
    defence – trespass by “the victim of the assault” – was also not met.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant argues that this case did not involve the ejection of a trespasser
    but, rather, the prevention of a continuing trespass – the NATO air strikes.  Relying
    on the evidence of Witnesses A and B, he submits that the only means available
    to the Bosnian Serbs and, hence, the appellant, to prevent this trespass
    was to take hostages.  This argument presumes that the NATO bombings constituted
    a trespass, a contention that I have already rejected.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    in my view, there was no evidence at trial capable of leaving the jury with
    a reasonable doubt that using unarmed peacekeeping observers as human shields
    in the hope of averting or stopping an air strike was a reasonable response
    to NATO’s action.  On the evidence, all that was required to avoid the bombings,
    in accordance with UN Security Council Resolution 836, was the return of
    the heavy weapons that had been removed by the Serbian army from the UN weapons
    collection areas by the designated deadline and the honouring of the safe
    zones.  That the Serbian forces elected to reject this option did not render
    the use of human shields a justified and reasonable response to the NATO
    bombing.  </p>

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[U]nder the defence of self or others, you have
    three issues and they can be posed in the form of three questions, the first
    of which is, <i>was Mr. Ribic or anybody under his protection the subject

    use - - assuming you answered the first either “Yes” or are left in a reasonable

    of force?</i>  <i>And thirdly,</i> <i>did Mr. Ribic use more force than was
    reasonably necessary to prevent the assault or stop it from continuing or
    being repeated?</i></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It does not matter whether Ribic or someone else
    provoked the assault or even assaulted first.  <i>It is essential, however,
    that Mr. Ribic or a person or persons under his protection were actually
    assaulted.  It’s not enough that Mr. Ribic may have believed that he or some
    person under his protection might be or would be assaulted at some point

style='"Times New Roman"'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant maintains that this instruction constituted misdirection because
    s.&nbsp;37(1) affords a defence to the use of force in response to an apprehended
    future assault.  He also submits that the jury should have been told that
    an honest but mistaken belief as to the existence of an assault, or the repetition
    of it, is sufficient to engage s. 37(1).   I would reject these arguments.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this case, there was no issue of a perceived or apprehended future assault.  A
    NATO air strike was underway when the hostages were captured and air strikes
    continued thereafter.  In these circumstances, I agree with the trial judge’s
    observation during his post-charge discussions with counsel that the suggestion
    of an apprehended future assault was academic.  As the trial judge put it:
    “The bombs are falling.  I don’t think it’s a very live issue in the sense
    that if [the jurors are] going to find an assault, [they’re] going to find
    it was occurring, not that it was apprehended.”</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    the defence envisaged by s. 37(1) contemplates the use of “no more force
    than is necessary to prevent the assault or the repetition of it”.  In other
    words, the force used must be both necessary and proportionate.  The trial
    judge’s instruction tracked this statutory language.  Indeed, it was modeled
    on

    on this record, there was no evidential support for an instruction on an
    honest but mistaken belief by the appellant concerning the existence of an
    assault on the munitions depot and the bunkers.  Perhaps for this reason,
    the defence did not request an instruction on honest but mistaken belief
    in the occurrence or repetition of an unlawful assault.  Nor did the trial
    judge’s charge on s. 37(1) draw an objection on this ground or a request

      no room for the proposition that an honest but mistaken belief about the
      manifest illegality of a superior’s order is sufficient to implicate the
      defence of superior orders.  A subjective element to this defence was plainly
      rejected in <i>Finta</i>, at p. 844:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The trial judge correctly instructed the jury that
    the accused charged with an offence under s. 7(3.71) cannot claim that, although
    a reasonable person would in the circumstances have known that the actions
    allegedly performed had the factual quality of crimes against humanity or
    war crimes, he mistakenly thought that they were lawful and that therefore
    he was justified in following orders and performing the actions.  If this
    were so then an accused could always claim the defence of obedience to military
    orders by stating that the illegality of the order simply did not occur to
    him or her at the time.  This would be stretching the defence beyond all
    reasonable limits.  If it were permitted it would require the Crown to establish
    that the accused knew the orders and his or her actions were manifestly unlawful.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    second prong of the appellant’s challenge to the trial judge’s instruction
    on this defence is the submission that an order may not be manifestly unlawful
    if some justification for it was <i>possible</i> at the time that the order
    was carried out.  The appellant relies on Witness A’s testimony that UNPROFOR,
    NATO and the UN military observers were regarded by the warring factions
    as part and parcel of the same enterprise.  Both Witnesses A and B testified
    that once the UN and NATO began bombing, the Serbs considered them to be
    enemy combatants and parties to the Bosnian conflict, such that they became
    legitimate targets of hostile action.  The appellant also stresses Witness
    A’s evidence that he had information from “direct [intelligence] sources” that
    the decision to take hostages came from a “very high level” of the Serbian
    leadership and points out that Witness A said that the appellant was a “very
    low-key player” who was not involved in command decisions, that he was following
    orders, and that he was not in a position to stop or prevent the hostage-taking.  </p>

    would not accede to this argument.  In <i>Finta</i>, a majority of the Supreme
    Court of Canada held, at pp. 845-46:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[The defence] will not be available where the orders
    in question were manifestly unlawful.  Even where the orders were manifestly
    unlawful, the defence of obedience to superior orders … will be available
    in those circumstances where the accused had no moral choice as to whether
    to follow the orders.  That is to say, there was such an air of compulsion
    and threat to the accused that the accused had no alternative but to obey
    the orders.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>These
    prerequisites to reliance on the defence of obedience to superior orders
    were not met here.  In <i>Finta</i>, unlike this case, there was no question
    about the fact of a “military order” or that the accused was subject to the
    order.  In contrast, there was no evidence in this case of <i>any</i> order
    concerning the hostage-taking that the appellant was <i>obliged</i> to follow.  </p>

    particular, on the evidence, the appellant’s status and role with the Serbian
    forces was unclear.  Witness A’s testimony concerning the existence of an
    order to take hostages that bound the appellant amounted to no more than
    an assumption.  Witness A acknowledged that his evidence of an order was
    based on his “assessment” of the decision-making structure of the Serbian
    military and political leadership and his perception of the appellant’s role
    with the Serbian forces.  He confirmed that he did not know where the alleged
    order or orders came from.  Before this court, the appellant himself recognized
    the absence of evidence of an actual order when he indicated in his factum
    that “an order <i>may</i> have been given”.  </p>

    conclude, therefore, that the appellant’s challenge to the trial judge’s

    it is unnecessary to address the remaining arguments advanced by the Crown

    are two bases for the appellant’s argument that the trial judge erred by
    refusing to grant a stay of the proceedings on the ground of a violation
    of the appellant’s s.&nbsp;7 <i>Charter</i> rights.  First, the appellant
    attacks the Disclosure Process itself, describing it as “unprecedented and
    manifestly unfair”.  He complains that neither he nor anyone who represented
    his interests was permitted to participate in the examinations of Witnesses
    A and B in the Federal Court disclosure proceedings, and no opportunity was
    afforded to his counsel to provide follow-up questions to be posed to the
    witnesses by examining counsel.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    the appellant argues that the form and manner of the presentation of Witness
    A’s and Witness B’s evidence at trial as mandated by the Disclosure Rulings – the
    reading of excerpts from the redacted transcripts of their testimony to the
    jury in lieu of calling these witnesses to provide <i>viva voce</i> evidence – breached
    his s. 7 <i>Charter</i> rights.  He also claims that the prejudicial effect
    of his inability to compel the oral evidence of these witnesses was illustrated,
    and exacerbated, by Crown counsel’s closing address to the jury, during which
    Crown counsel sought to impeach the reliability and credibility of Witnesses
    A and B by inviting the jury to compare their testimony as read to the jury
    with the
    “live” evidence of Crown witnesses who actually testified at trial.  </p>

    38 of the CEA sets out a comprehensive scheme concerning the disclosure of

    ’s international relations, national defence or national security.  It is
    unnecessary for the purpose of this appeal to review the s. 38 disclosure
    regime in detail, many of the key aspects of which are described in the FCA
    Decision.  However, certain of its features provide important context for
    the appellant’s attack on the Disclosure Process.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Under
    s. 38, the Attorney General of Canada is empowered, in his or her discretion,
    to authorize or agree to the disclosure of all or part of information or
    facts believed to be sensitive or potentially injurious to Canada’s state
    interests (ss. 38.03(1), 38.031(1) and 38.04(6)), or to apply to the Federal
    Court for an order with respect to the disclosure of such information (s.&nbsp;38.04).  In
    addition, under s. 38.04(2)(c), a person who wishes to disclose or cause
    disclosure of such information may apply to the Federal Court for an order
    with respect to disclosure of the information.  The appellant invoked s.&nbsp;38.04(2)(c)
    in this case.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Absent
    the Attorney General’s authorization of or agreement to disclosure, a judge
    of the Federal Court is to determine disclosure requests.  Unless the reviewing
    judge concludes that the disclosure of the information would be injurious
    to international relations, national defence or national security, he or
    she has the discretion to authorize the disclosure of the requested information
    (s.&nbsp;38.06(1)).</p>

    where the reviewing judge concludes that the disclosure of the information
    would be injurious to international relations, national defence or national
    security, he or she is obliged to weigh the public interest in disclosure
    against the public interest in non-disclosure.  If, after undertaking this
    balancing exercise and considering “the form of and conditions to disclosure
    that are most likely to limit any injury to international relations or national
    defence or national security resulting from disclosure”, the reviewing judge
    concludes that the public interest in disclosure outweighs in importance
    the public interest in non-disclosure, the disclosure of the information
    may be authorized, in whole or in part (s. 38.06(2)).  See also <i>Charkaoui

    appellant does not challenge the constitutionality of the s. 38 statutory
    scheme.  Nor do I understand him to dispute that the purpose of the scheme
    is to strike a balance between the need for protection of confidential information
    and the rights of the individual: <i>Charkaoui</i> at para. 77.  Rather,
    the contentious issue is whether the Disclosure Process, and the Disclosure
    Rulings that flowed from it, violated the appellant’s s. 7 <i>Charter</i> rights.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is undisputed that the Disclosure Process was unusual in several respects.  In
    the view of the Federal Court of Appeal, it was dictated by “urgency and
    necessity”: FCA Decision at para. 42.  As that court explained in the FCA
    Decision, at para. 6:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>This process was devised to assist the Trial Division
    in determining the relevancy of the two witnesses’
    information to the prosecution of the appellant as well as identifying the
    sensitive information which could not be disclosed.  I should add that the
    process was also conceived to obviate the lack of security clearance of the
    appellant’s counsel.  Some of the information was accessible on a need to
    know basis only and required security clearance at the highest level.  That
    the process so devised and followed was unusual is common ground.</p>

    38 of the CEA was significantly amended by the <i>Anti-terrorism Act</i>,
    S.C. 2001, c. 41, s. 43.  We were informed that the Federal Court proceedings
    in this case were the first of their kind conducted under the amended legislation.  As
    a result, some of the protective measures apparently now utilized under the
    amended s. 38 regime – <i>e.g.</i>, the use of special counsel to serve as <i>amicus
    curiae</i> or as counsel on behalf of a disclosure applicant – were not yet
    employed.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span

    are the first rulings under s.&nbsp;38 involving the disclosure of proposed <i>defence</i> evidence
    in a criminal trial.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Unquestionably,
    the method of examination of Witnesses A and B under the Disclosure Process
    was far from ideal, involving as it did a filter between the appellant’s
    counsel and the witnesses and a proscription on the direct participation
    of the appellant’s counsel in the examination process.  That said, it is
    my opinion that the appellant cannot rely on a challenge to the fairness
    of the Disclosure Process itself to support his claim in this court that
    a stay of the prosecution should have been granted due to the alleged infringement
    of his s. 7 <i>Charter</i> rights.  I say this for several reasons.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    the parties acknowledge that the Disclosure Process was generated by the
    prevailing exigencies of time.  However, these exigencies, at least in part,
    were precipitated by the defence.  The defence first indicated its intention
    to call Witnesses A and B after the close of the Crown’s case at the appellant’s
    first trial.  This tactical decision, a considered choice by the defence,
    placed the appellant’s criminal trial in ‘limbo’ by holding it in abeyance
    pending the outcome of a defence disclosure application and a motion for
    directions by the Attorney General to the Federal Court.  Consequently, the
    timing of the defence decision to seek to adduce the evidence of Witnesses
    A and B generated urgency regarding the process to be followed for the determination
    of the disclosure proceedings.  The matter was further complicated by the
    fact that the appellant’s counsel did not hold the security clearances necessary
    to review Witness A’s and Witness B’s information.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ultimately,
    the Disclosure Process was authorized by <i>consent</i> court order of the
    Federal Court.  Under that order, the Disclosure Process involved examinations
    of Witnesses A and B based on areas of questioning identified by the appellant’s
    counsel.  In addition, the order required that while examining counsel questioned
    the witnesses, the appellant’s counsel “will remain available to provide
    further explanations on relevancy and suggestions as to possible areas of
    questioning”.  The appellant thus participated, through counsel, in the design
    and approval of the Disclosure Process of which he now complains.  Although
    the appellant’s counsel did not personally conduct the examinations in question,
    they had a pivotal role throughout.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    by renewing his attack on the fairness of the Disclosure Process before this
    court, the appellant seeks to relitigate issues that have already been judicially
    determined, with the expenditure of considerable judicial resources.  At
    heart, this amounts to an impermissible collateral attack on the Disclosure
    Rulings that flowed from the Disclosure Process.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Federal Court of Appeal expressly considered the fairness of the Disclosure
    Process.  That court addressed and rejected the defence claim that the Disclosure
    Process was flawed because the appellant and his counsel did not participate
    directly in the questioning of Witnesses A and B and were prevented from
    proposing supplementary or follow-up questions to be posed to the witnesses.  The
    court pointed out that the record includes lists of supplementary questions
    provided by the appellant’s counsel to examining counsel.  In the opinion
    of the court, the Disclosure Process included measures designed to ensure
    that “the appellant would obtain disclosure of all sensitive information
    that could be disclosed without unduly compromising national security, national
    defence or international relations”: FCA Decision at para. 45.  The court
    concluded that the Disclosure Process was fair to the appellant in the circumstances.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Federal Court judge also reviewed all the evidence of Witnesses A and B in
    unexpurgated form and heard testimony from three witnesses concerning the
    confidentiality of the information at issue.  Unlike the first trial judge,
    the Federal Court judge was informed of the nature of the appellant’s proposed
    defences at his criminal trial.  Thus, he was able to fully assess the relevance
    and significance of Witness A’s and Witness B’s evidence to the appellant’s
    case.  His consideration of the factors relevant to the balancing of the
    competing public interests in disclosure and non-disclosure of the witnesses’ information
    reveals that he was alert to the appellant’s interests in obtaining disclosure
    of the requested information. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    I have indicated, the Attorney General eventually agreed to the disclosure
    of much of Witness A’s and Witness B’s testimony.  The Federal Court judge
    reviewed the remainder of their testimony and concluded that it fell into
    three categories: (i) information not relevant to an issue at the appellant’s
    criminal trial; (ii) relevant information that need not be disclosed; and
    (iii) relevant information that needed to be disclosed.  The area of controversy
    centred on the information in the second category.  In respect of that information,
    the Federal Court judge made the following key findings in his First Disclosure
    Ruling, at para. 27:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In assessing the expurgated testimony of the witnesses,
    I think it fair to say that much of the expurgated information deals with
    operationally sensitive material which would serve to corroborate testimony,
    given in other parts of the transcripts, which has been disclosed to the
    applicant. … <i>The</i> <i>expurgated information, although corroborative,
    would not, in my view, disclose any new information that would be helpful
    to the defence that is not already contained in the expurgated transcripts
    of the testimony of the two witnesses</i>.  <i>It is my view that</i> <i>the
    testimony available to the applicant from the expurgated transcripts provides
    him with sufficient information</i>, if found admissible by the trial judge, <i>to
    fairly represent the evidence of the two witnesses</i> which would otherwise
    be available to the defence.  <i>It is my view that, for the purposes of
    the defences intended to be raised at trial, the expurgated transcripts reflect
    fairly the nature and substance of the testimony of the two witnesses</i>.  I
    therefore conclude that the information which I include in this second category,
    although relevant, need not be disclosed.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus,
    after a full review of all the evidence, the Federal Court judge was satisfied,
    given the substantive defences sought to be raised by the appellant at trial,
    that the available information necessary for the appellant’s defences was
    contained in the expurgated versions of the testimony authorized for disclosure.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    assessment was confirmed by three appellate judges of the Federal Court of
    Appeal.  Those judges reviewed the evidence that the Federal Court judge
    directed should not be disclosed and, based on that independent review, held
    that, “the vetted sensitive information is neither necessary … nor crucial
    to the defences raised by the appellant” and that, “for the purposes of [the
    appellant’s proposed] defences, the expurgated transcripts reflect fairly
    the nature and substance of the testimony of the two witnesses and that the
    vetted information would not be helpful”: FCA Decision at para. 41.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly,
    in the end, four judges of courts that are experienced in dealing with national
    security and national defence issues evaluated the fairness of the Disclosure
    Process and the nature and sufficiency of the information authorized for
    disclosure.  They unanimously held that the information to be disclosed was
    fair and protective of the appellant’s interests to the extent possible,
    given the nature of the information at issue, the defences sought to be raised
    by the appellant at his criminal trial, and the urgency of the situation.  As
    I have said, leave to appeal that determination to the Supreme Court of Canada
    was refused.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    turn now to the issue whether the impact of the Disclosure Rulings impaired
    the appellant’s s. 7 <i>Charter</i> rights on the resumption of his criminal
    trial.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant raises a number of points concerning the fairness of the presentation
    of the defence evidence at trial.  He argues that: (i) the transcripts were
    repetitious, disjointed and confusing, with the result that reading the transcripts
    to the jury invited juror confusion and impaired juror concentration; (ii)
    the deletions in the transcripts of some of the witnesses’
    responses, the contents of which are unknown to the appellant, deprived the
    defence of access to information necessary to meet the Crown’s case; (iii)
    because he was precluded from calling Witnesses A and B to testify at trial,
    the jury was deprived of the opportunity to assess their credibility and
    the defence was denied the chance to elicit further evidence from them that
    may have clarified any inconsistencies and confusion in their testimony or
    otherwise bolstered their credibility; and (iv) the resulting unfairness
    to the defence was exacerbated by Crown counsel’s closing address to the
    jury.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    the matter of the transcripts: I agree with the appellant’s submission that,
    given the transcript redactions made under the Disclosure Rulings, the resulting
    version of the transcripts does not always reveal a coherent and logical
    testimonial progression.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>But
    the trial judge was alive to this deficiency and, in particular, to the potential
    negative impact on the jury of evidence presented in this form.  In his view, “[t]he
    jury was quite able to appreciate [the evidence] for what value it could
    be to the defence.”  With respect to Witness A’s evidence, the trial judge
    held: “[T]he main important points to the defence came through very clearly,
    notwithstanding the form of the presentation of the evidence and of its edited
    content.”  In the trial judge’s opinion, the core of Witness A’s evidence
    that was helpful to the defence was clearly communicated to the jury.  He
    reached a similar conclusion concerning Witness B’s evidence, which he described
    as relating mainly to the process of NATO’s selection of bombing targets
    and associated matters, saying: “[it] hardly goes to the heart of any defence” and “I
    do not consider that the evidence of B and the jury’s evaluation of it will
    be significantly impaired by its form or edited substance.” </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Overall,
    the trial judge concluded:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I think the evidence of A … came through clearly
    and there being no evidence contrary to or challenging the credibility of
    A or the substance of [his] evidence on grounds relating to the manner in
    which it was given, I have concluded that the limits as to A and B’s evidence
    complained of by the defence do not go so far as to render the trial constitutionally
    unfair.  The accused relies on A and B’s evidence for his defence and I think
    it was made available in a process of sufficient fairness in all the circumstances.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>These
    findings regarding the jury’s opportunity to understand the defence evidence
    and the fairness of its presentation attract great deference from this court.  The
    trial judge was uniquely positioned to observe the jury as the defence evidence
    was read in at trial and to assess the impact of that procedure on the jury.  Unlike
    the trial judge, this court is unable to evaluate firsthand the dynamics
    in the courtroom during the presentation of the defence evidence, the reaction
    of the jury throughout, and the jury’s attention to and opportunity to comprehend
    the evidence tendered.  These are matters firmly within the domain of the
    trial judge: see for example, <i>R. v. Shearing</i>, [2002] 3 S.C.R. 33,
    at para. 73.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    I am unable to accept the appellant’s claim that the transcript deletions
    removed “vital” information from the purview of the defence and, hence, from
    that of the jury.  This suggestion is speculative at best.  For example,
    although the defence stresses that one of the deletions involved the redaction
    of the names of the sources that Witness A relied on to express the view
    that, in carrying out the hostage-taking, the appellant was following orders,
    Witness A did not suggest that any of the identified sources actually gave
    or knew of such an order.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    suggestion that the transcript deletions pertain to information “vital” to
    the defence is also inconsistent with the Disclosure Rulings and the FCA
    Decision.  As I have emphasized, the Federal Court of Appeal reviewed <i>all</i> the
    evidence that was deleted from the transcripts and unanimously concluded,
    given the appellant’s proposed defences, that “[t]he expurgated transcripts
    reflect fairly the nature and substance of the testimony of the two witnesses
    and … the vetted information would not be helpful”: FCA Decision at para.
    41.  The Federal Court judge reached a similar conclusion: First Disclosure
    Ruling at para. 27.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[101]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Federal Court of Appeal also specifically considered whether the form in
    which the disclosure of Witness A’s and Witness B’s evidence was authorized
    (<i>i.e.</i>, the expurgated transcripts) resulted in significant unfairness.  The
    court noted Witness A’s and Witness B’s acknowledgement that they were
    “incapable of separating sensitive from non-sensitive information” and the
    Federal Court judge’s observation in his First Disclosure Ruling at para.
    35 that:
    “In their testimony, the two witnesses wove innocuous information with information
    that cannot be publicly disclosed. … Implementing a demarcation line, in
    the context of a criminal trial conducted before a jury, is clearly not practical
    if not impossible”: FCA Decision at para. 51.  The court then concluded at
    para. 52: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In the circumstances, release of the expurgated
    transcript[s] and an authorization to introduce them in evidence at the criminal
    trial amount[s] to a balancing of the competing interests which best serves
    the public interest while limiting as much as possible the injury [to Canada’s
    international relations, national defence or national security].</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Importantly,
    the defence also derived considerable benefit from the prohibition against
    calling Witnesses A and B at trial.  Because these witnesses did not testify
    before the jury, they were insulated from cross-examination by the Crown.  As
    a result, much of their evidence was uncontradicted.  It is reasonable to
    assume that if they had been cross-examined by the Crown, any discrepancies
    or other weaknesses in their testimony would have been highlighted in an
    effort to undermine their credibility.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    addition, as the Crown points out, much of these witnesses’ evidence constitutes
    hearsay or opinion evidence.  The trial judge dismissed the defence applications
    to qualify Witnesses A and B as experts.  However, throughout their testimony,
    both witnesses – especially Witness A – professed expertise and offered opinions
    about key events and participants in the Bosnian conflict.  Witness A also
    offered his opinion of the appellant’s level of authority with the Serbian
    forces.  If these witnesses had testified at trial, the admission of much
    of their evidence may well have been challenged and ultimately excluded.  In
    the event, the Crown made no objection at trial to the admission of their
    evidence as read to the jury.  This was a significant concession that enured
    to the benefit of the defence.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Nor
    am I persuaded that Crown counsel’s closing address fatally compromised trial
    fairness.  When urging the jury to prefer Rechner’s and Zidlik’s testimony
    over that of Witnesses A and B, Crown counsel described Rechner and Zidlik
    as the “witnesses you actually heard” and reminded the jury that it heard
    these witnesses give evidence “from this witness stand”.  He also told the
    jurors that they were “going to have to be pretty careful before you use
    Witness A’s evidence to prove anything in this case”, that they “[couldn’t]
    rely on all of [Witness] B’s evidence”, and that, “[t]here may be parts of
    it you can, but there’s a lot of it you can’t and I think you have to question
    both A and B.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To
    begin, Crown counsel was entitled to attack the credibility and reliability
    of the defence witnesses in his closing address and to point out to the jury
    those factors that favoured the acceptance of the Crown’s evidence over that
    of the defence.  The fact that Witnesses A and B did not testify at trial
    was not over-emphasized by Crown counsel.  Rather, this factor was inferentially
    identified by him as one consideration, among others, to be taken into account
    by the jury when assessing the evidence.  Importantly, as I have said, as
    Witnesses A and B did not testify, much of their evidence was uncontradicted.  It
    is most unlikely that this fact escaped the jury’s attention.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    note that no objection to the Crown’s closing address on this ground was
    made at trial by experienced defence counsel.  Nor does it appear that defence
    counsel raised the issue of the presentation of Witness A’s and Witness B’s
    evidence with the trial judge during pre-charge discussions for the purpose
    of seeking the inclusion of a cautionary instruction in the jury charge.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Nonetheless,
    the trial judge told the jury that both it and the defence were disadvantaged
    by not having heard the “live” evidence of Witnesses A and B.  In providing
    this caution, which occupied almost four pages of his jury charge, the trial
    judge specifically referenced Crown counsel’s closing address and some of
    the factors that Crown counsel had suggested diminished these witnesses’ credibility.  His
    warning included these comments:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[S]o be careful about the witnesses who you just
    heard their evidence read or heard the record of their evidence, because
    they’re not in the same position and it can cut both ways.  They weren’t
    in the position to be questioned by both counsel here and have focused answers
    on certain things, so there’s a disadvantage possibly to you in not hearing
    them live and there may be an equal or more serious disadvantage in not -
    - the questioners not being able to focus their questioning the way they
    could in examination, cross-examination and re-examination live in your presence.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Take that into account when you’re examining the
    things that A and B said that you are weighing and evaluating.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>This instruction was more than adequate
    to counter any prejudice to the defence arising from the impugned comments
    by Crown counsel.  </p>
  <h2><i>Conclusion </i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    is no doubt that it would have been preferable if the defence had been able
    to call Witnesses A and B to testify at trial.  An accused’s rights to a
    fair trial and to make full answer and defence are principles of fundamental
    justice protected by s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>.  They encompass the right
    to defend against “all of the state’s efforts to achieve a conviction” (<i>R.
    v. Rose</i>, [1998] 3 S.C.R. 262, at para. 103) and to have “the opportunity
    adequately to state [one’s] case” (<i>R. v. Seaboyer; R. v. Gayme</i>, [1991]
    2 S.C.R. 577, at para. 32).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    these fundamental rights are not absolute.  The jurisprudence of the Supreme
    Court of Canada recognizes that national security considerations can justify
    limitations on the extent and form of disclosure of confidential information
    to affected individuals.  Moreover, s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i> does not include
    a guarantee that evidence may be tendered at a criminal trial in any particular
    form.  In <i>Charkaoui, </i>the Supreme Court explained at paras. 20 and
    23:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Section 7 of the <i>Charter</i> requires not a particular
    type of process, but a fair process having regard to the nature of the proceedings
    and the interests at stake. … The procedures required to meet the demands
    of fundamental justice depend on the context. </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:
center'>….</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>If the context makes it impossible to adhere to
    the principles of fundamental justice in their usual form, adequate substitutes
    may be found.  But the principles must be respected to pass the hurdle of
    s. 7.  That is the bottom line.  [Citations omitted.]</p>

    am satisfied that adequate measures were found in the context of this unusual
    case to respect the appellant’s s. 7 <i>Charter</i> rights.  As a result,
    there is no basis for appellate interference with the trial judge’s discretionary
    decision to refuse the extraordinary remedy of a stay of the proceedings
    under s. 24(1) of the <i>Charter</i> based on the appellant’s s. 7 claim.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    follows that I also disagree with the appellant’s submission that the trial
    judge erred by refusing to grant a stay under s. 38.14 of the CEA.  That
    provision reads:  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>            (1) The person presiding at a criminal
    proceeding may make any order that he or she considers appropriate in the
    circumstances to protect the right of the accused to a fair trial, as long
    as that order complies with the terms of any order made under any of subsections
    38.06(1) to (3) in relation to that proceeding, any judgment made on appeal
    from, or review of, the order, or any certificate issued under section 38.13.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>            (2) The orders that may be made under
    subsection (1) include, but are not limited to, the following orders:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><i>(a) </i>an order dismissing specified counts
    of the indict-ment or information, or permitting the indictment or information
    to proceed only in respect of a lesser or included offence;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><i>(b) </i>an order effecting a stay of the proceedings;
    and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><i>(c) </i>an order finding against any party on
    any issue relating to information the disclosure of which is pro-hibited.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[112]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Under
    s. 38.14, a judge presiding over a criminal trial, in the exercise of his
    or her discretion, is authorized to make any order appropriate in the circumstances –
    including a stay order – to protect the right of an accused to a fair trial,
    as long as the order contemplated complies with the terms of any disclosure
    order made by the Federal Court.  This remedial power is independent of the
    remedies afforded under s. 24(1) of the <i>Charter</i> for a violation of
    an accused’s <i>Charter</i> rights.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[113]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    his s. 7 ruling, the trial judge expressly acknowledged that the appellant
    relied on both s. 24(1) of the <i>Charter</i> and s. 38.14 of the CEA to
    ground his stay request and indicated that he intended “to deal with both
    bases for the remedial order together”.  This approach is unobjectionable.  As
    the result would inevitably have been the same, a separate analysis by the
    trial judge of the relief sought and the standard to be met under s. 38.14
    was unnecessary.  All the factors that justified the denial of a stay under
    s. 24(1) of the <i>Charter</i> applied with equal force to the appellant’s
    request for a stay under s. 38.14 of the CEA.  </p>
  <h2>(3)       Section 11(b) Applications</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[114]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    right of an accused to be tried within a reasonable time is enshrined in
    s. 11(b) of the <i>Charter</i>.  That section is designed to protect both
    an accused’s individual rights and the rights of society.  The individual
    rights that s. 11(b) seeks to protect include the right to a fair trial: <i>R.
    v. Morin</i>, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 771, at p. 786.  Section 11(b) jurisprudence
    recognizes that “the interests of the accused must be balanced by the interests
    of society in law enforcement”: <i>Morin</i> at p. 787.  As this court has
    observed, “The societal rights protected by s. 11(b) include the community’s
    interests in law enforcement by having those who break the law tried quickly
    and in having those accused of crime dealt with fairly”: <i>R. v. Seegmiller</i> (2004),
    191 C.C.C. (3d) 347, at para. 9; <i>R. v. Qureshi</i> (2004), 190 C.C.C.
    (3d) 453, at para. 9.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[115]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    assessment of a s. 11(b) <i>Charter</i> claim therefore involves the balancing
    of these interests against factors that
    “either inevitably lead to delay or are otherwise the cause of delay”: <i>Morin</i> at
    p. 787.  This balancing exercise permits a judicial examination of whether
    the delay in a particular case is constitutionally unreasonable: <i>Seegmiller</i> at
    para. 10.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[116]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    s. 11(b) reasonableness analysis requires scrutiny of the time from the date
    of the charge against the accused to the date of the end of trial.  Four
    factors are critical: (i) the length of the delay; (ii) any waiver by the
    accused of time periods; (iii) the reasons for the delay; and (iv) any prejudice
    to the accused: <i>R. v. Askov</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1199, at pp. 1231-32; <i>Morin</i> at
    pp. 787-88.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[117]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this case, the first two factors are not in issue.  Approximately 79 months
    passed between the date on which the appellant was charged (February 17,
    1999) and his sentencing (September 14, 2005).  The trial judge found, and
    the Crown concedes, that the length of the delay warranted judicial examination
    and that there had been no constitutional waiver of the delay.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span

    the issues for determination are the reasons for the delay in bringing the
    appellant to trial and any prejudice occasioned by the delay.  Both were
    addressed by the trial judge in his s. 11(b) rulings.  I will consider each
    issue in turn.</p>
  <h2><i>Reasons for Delay</i></h2>
  <h2><i><u>February 17, 1999 to November 5, 2001</u></i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    first period of delay spans the time from the laying of the information on
    February 17, 1999 to November 5, 2001, when the appellant’s first trial was
    originally scheduled to commence.  Several significant events occurred during
    this period.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[120]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant was arrested in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Germany</st1:country-region>
    on February 20, 1999 and extradited to
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    in police custody on May 13, 1999.  He was released on bail five days later,
    on condition that he reside with his parents in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Edmonton.  On September 27, 1999, a preliminary inquiry was scheduled to
    be conducted in provincial court on May 23 to May 29, 2000.  The inquiry
    proceeded on those dates and the Crown completed its evidence.  However,
    through no fault of the Crown, cross-examination by the defence of the last
    witness, General Smith (who had travelled to
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    from
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Europe to testify) was not completed before his scheduled return overseas
    the same day.  As a result, the dates of November 15 to 17, 2000 were selected
    for the resumption of his cross-examination.  However, on October 26, 2000,
    the Attorney General for
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario agreed to prefer a direct indictment against the appellant.  On November
    3, 2000, the appellant made his first appearance in the Superior Court of
    Justice and a trial date of November 5, 2001 was set.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[121]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    elapsed time from February 17, 1999 to November 5, 2001 was approximately
    32 months.  With respect to this period, the trial judge noted in his original
    s. 11(b) ruling that the intake period was “a little longer than usual because
    of the foreign arrest and extradition”, although the extradition was unopposed.  The
    extradition process took about three months.  The trial judge also observed: “[t]he
    case took a year to get to a preliminary inquiry” and, as a result of disclosure
    issues and various pre-trial motions – including a motion by the Crown to
    take commission evidence from a witness in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Europe – “[g]etting the case to a scheduled trial date of November 5, 2001
    took another year”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[122]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Before
    this court, the Crown argues that the initial intake period ended on September
    27, 1999, when the date for the preliminary inquiry was fixed.  On this approach,
    the Crown submits, the initial intake period of about seven and a half months
    was reasonable in the particular circumstances of this case and is neutral
    in the s. 11(b) delay calculation.  The Crown further asserts that a second
    intake period began with the appellant’s November 3, 2000 first appearance
    in the superior court, when a trial date was set for the following November.  The
    Crown argues that a period of 12 months for the preliminary inquiry and the
    first scheduled trial date is reasonable in this case.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[123]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    agree.  Various pre-trial disclosure issues and motions were being dealt
    with during this period, including a Crown motion for commission evidence
    that was later abandoned when the proposed witness proved unco-operative.  As
    the trial judge observed in his original s. 11(b) ruling: “The disclosure
    issues adjudicated and the preparation to take commission evidence all seem
    to be complications of the sort inherent in proceedings involving events
    in another country, foreign witnesses, and sensitive information in an international
    context.”   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[124]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    more complicated the case, the greater the inherent time requirements will
    be.  The delay in completing the preliminary inquiry was due, at least in
    part, to the defence request for an adjournment in order to prepare for the
    completion of cross-examination.  Thereafter, it appears the delay in obtaining
    continuation dates for the preliminary inquiry was attributable to institutional
    factors.  This case also involved a trial in superior court, coupled with
    a preliminary inquiry.  Given all these factors, it is my view that the time
    expended between February 17, 1999 and the fall of 2001 was not constitutionally
    unreasonable.</p>
  <h2><i><u>September 2001 to October 2002</u></i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[125]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    next key development involves the delay in the appellant’s November 2001
    scheduled trial date.  During the fall of 2001, an important issue arose
    regarding disclosure by the Crown of the lead police investigator’s file.  Notwithstanding
    earlier defence requests, this copious file was not disclosed to the appellant’s
    counsel until September 19, 2001, prompting an adjournment of the November
    5, 2001 scheduled trial date until April 2002.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[126]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When
    the appellant’s lead defence counsel informed the court that he was unavailable
    for trial in April 2002 due to other commitments, the October 2002 trial
    date was set.  The trial judge held that the resulting 11-month delay (from
    November 2001 to October 2002) was attributable to late Crown disclosure
    of the police investigator’s file.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[127]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown’s late disclosure of the investigator’s file clearly led to some delay
    in bringing the appellant to trial.  It is less clear, however, that the
    entire 11-month delay should be laid at the feet of the Crown.  In my view,
    three considerations support the conclusion that this delay was not unreasonable.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[128]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    the defence disclosure requests led to litigation involving third party records
    and information in the hands of both domestic and foreign agencies.  Some
    of the information sought from domestic agencies triggered Crown privilege
    claims, which were then adjudicated in the Federal Court under s. 38 of the
    CEA.  The complexity of this litigation is a proper consideration in assessing
    the reasonableness of the 11-month delay.  I also agree with the Crown’s
    submission that even if the police investigator’s file had been disclosed
    earlier, these third party production and disclosure proceedings would have
    taken place and been considered as part of the inherent time requirements
    of the case.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[129]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    an April 2002 trial date was offered, but the appellant’s lead counsel was
    unavailable that month.  Based on this scheduling difficulty, at least five
    months additional delay transpired (April 2002 to October 2002).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[130]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third,
    I emphasize that the defence first learned of Witness A’s and Witness B’s
    information – from defence sources – during the 11-month delay that followed
    the adjournment of the first trial date.  Consequently, if the trial had
    proceeded as originally scheduled in November 2001, the defence would not
    have benefited from this information and, ultimately, from any of the evidence
    of these witnesses.  This evidence, it will be recalled, was the only defence
    evidence adduced at trial.  It was characterized by the appellant’s counsel
    as “vital” and
    “fundamental” to the defence.  In these circumstances, the delay in the commencement
    of the first trial produced an unintended yet critical advantage for the
    defence.  The delay, therefore, was more prejudicial to the Crown’s case
    than it was to that of the defence.</p>
  <h2><i><u>October 2002 to May 2005</u></i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[131]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    CEA s. 38 disclosure proceedings occasioned further delay.  Before the trial
    judge, the Crown asserted that approximately a 20-month period was associated
    with these proceedings (from the close of the Crown’s case in October 2002
    to the scheduled June 2004 commencement date of the appellant’s second trial),
    which time was attributable to the defence pursuit of evidence for its own
    purposes.  In contrast, the defence argued that this delay was attributable
    to the Crown because “the government’s legislation”
    necessitated the s. 38 disclosure proceedings.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[132]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Federal Court proceedings were triggered in October 2002, when the defence
    sought to call the evidence of Witnesses A and B at trial.  Approximately
    one year later, on October 22, 2003, the appellant’s application for leave
    to appeal the FCA Decision was refused by the Supreme Court of Canada.  The
    Attorney General then applied for authorization to disclose in the public
    domain certain of the information and documents relating to the s. 38 proceedings,
    including the Disclosure Rulings.  That authorization was provided by order
    of the Federal Court dated April 8, 2004.</p>

    was held five days later, on April 6.  At that conference, April 12, 2004
    was set for argument of the appellant’s pre-trial s. 11(b) <i>Charter</i> application
    and a trial date was fixed for June 14, 2004.  On April 20, 2004, after a
    four-day hearing, the appellant’s first s.&nbsp;11(b) application was dismissed
    by the trial judge.  The stage was set for the appellant’s trial.</p>

    on June 14, 2004, when jury selection was to begin, the parties jointly sought
    an adjournment to examine personal files retained by the former Canadian
    military attaché in Belgrade in 1995 (the Crandall materials), which apparently
    had only then come to light.  The trial was adjourned and the Crown undertook
    a review of the Crandall materials for the purpose of disclosure.  By mid-September
    2004, the Crown had completed an inventory of what it said could be disclosed
    to the defence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[135]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    the defence disputed the Crown’s approach to the disclosure of the Crandall
    materials and no agreement had yet been reached regarding a new trial date.  The
    defence moved for further disclosure.  This motion, argued on November 8,
    2004, was dismissed by the trial judge on December 2, 2004.  The parties
    then agreed to a tentative trial date of May 3, 2005.  This trial date was
    confirmed when the defence indicated that May was the earliest time that
    the appellant’s counsel could be available for trial.  In the end, the trial
    was postponed an additional week and jury selection commenced on May 9, 2005.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[136]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    these facts, the time expended by the CEA s. 38 disclosure proceedings, including
    the associated appeals, accounted for approximately 18 months delay (October
    2002 to April 8, 2004).  Thereafter, about 13 months additional delay (April
    2004 to May 2005) was occasioned by the Crown’s delayed disclosure of the
    Crandall materials, the subsequent defence motion for further disclosure
    of those materials, and conflicts in defence counsel’s trial schedule.  Of
    this additional 13-month delay, the trial judge attributed about three months
    to the Crown by reason of late disclosure.  He indicated that the remaining
    ten months was
    “at best, neutral” and “possibly arguably, could be laid, at least gently,
    at the feet of the defence”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[137]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>With
    one variation, I agree with these delay allocations.  Nothing turns on whether
    three or, as the Crown would have it, two months of this delay is attributable
    to the Crown.  At least two months was associated with the late disclosure
    of the Crandall materials.  Of the remaining delay, about three months was
    consumed with the unsuccessful defence application for further disclosure.  That
    time should be assigned to the defence.  The remaining delay until May 2005
    was required to accommodate defence counsel’s trial schedule.  That time
    should be regarded as neutral.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[138]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is also my view that the delay associated with the CEA s.&nbsp;38 disclosure
    proceedings cannot be allocated to the Crown.  The defence elected to pursue
    the evidence of Witnesses A and B, chose to wait until the close of the Crown’s
    case at the first trial to raise the admissibility of this evidence, and
    thereafter decided to exhaust all avenues of appeal concerning the Disclosure
    Rulings.  The defence, of course, was entitled to take these actions.  In
    so doing, it was obliged to comply with the national security-related disclosure
    scheme established by s. 38 of the CEA.  The ensuing disclosure proceedings
    were complex and time-consuming.  In the circumstances, although not blameworthy,
    these defence actions strongly undercut the conclusion of unreasonable delay
    in this case: see for example, <i>Morin</i> at pp. 793-94.</p>
  <h2><i>Prejudice</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[139]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    both of his s. 11(b) rulings, the trial judge held that the appellant suffered
    actual prejudice from the delay in reaching trial after his arrest.  In his
    original s. 11(b) ruling, he stated:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[T]hese proceedings have had a very negative impact
    on the lives of the accused and on his immediate family.  They have uprooted
    him and [his wife] from their lives in Germany, put his and her careers into
    neutral, placed them all under a great deal of stress and strain and eroded
    their financial security and their psychological health.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>The trial judge concluded that,
    as at April 2004: “[T]he five years these proceedings have now taken have
    worked a significant and real and enduring prejudice on the accused.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[140]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the appellant’s second s. 11(b) application, argued in June 2005, the appellant
    testified regarding the prejudice that he sustained in the year following
    the trial judge’s original s. 11(b) ruling.  The trial judge accepted that
    the stress experienced by the appellant and his family, what appeared to
    be the appellant’s permanent marital separation from his wife, and the appellant’s
    medical need to undertake an anti-depression medication regime during the
    period from April 2004 to June 2005 established continuing prejudice.   However,
    in the trial judge’s view, this prejudice had not “become worse in any significant
    degree”, although its duration had been extended.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[141]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge’s findings of prejudice, which are amply supported by the record,
    are not challenged by the Crown on appeal.  </p>
  <h2><i>Striking the Balance</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[142]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    his first s. 11(b) ruling, when attempting to balance society’s fundamental
    and important interest in bringing the accused to trial and those factors
    that led to significant delay and adverse impact on the appellant, the trial
    judge correctly noted that the crimes charged in this case are very serious
    offences, which are punishable by a maximum sentence of life imprisonment.  He
    also expressly averted to Sopinka J.’s critical observation in <i>Morin</i>,
    at p. 787 that: “As the seriousness of the offence increases so does the
    societal demand that the accused be brought to trial.”  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[143]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ultimately,
    after weighing the competing interests in detail and referring to the applicable
    legal principles that guide the balancing inquiry, the trial judge concluded
    that the seriousness of the offences in this case and “the national and international
    interests in bringing this case to trial” substantially outweighed the injury
    to the appellant’s interests in an earlier trial.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[144]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge came to a similar conclusion when he undertook a fresh s. 11(b)
    analysis at the conclusion of the evidential phase of the appellant’s second
    trial:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The passage of another year … brings the balance
    more towards a position favourable to the accused, but I do not see, now
    that I have heard all the evidence that the societal interests are lessened
    in any significant way.  Indeed…it seems to me, at least in terms of
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    ’s small role in endeavouring to assert the rule of law into the protection
    of UN personnel in such a civil conflagration, that the national and international
    societal interests in having this case prosecuted are every bit as weighty
    as they were a year ago, possibly even more so.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[145]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    agree.  The crimes charged against the appellant are grave indeed.  As the
    trial judge observed in his original s. 11(b) ruling, they “[strike] at the
    core of the safety and security of [UN] personnel in every outbreak of hostilities
    into which they are sent”.  Further, as the trial judge also stated, “
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    ’s armed forces … who participate in [UN] peace-making and peace-keeping
    efforts around the globe … and the armed services of all of the member states
    of the [UN] have a very real interest in [the] trial of this case.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[146]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    delay in this case, although considerable, was not unreasonable.  As this
    court recently stated in <i>R. v. Godin</i>, [2008] 237 O.A.C. 324, at para.
    46, appeal as of right to the S.C.C., [2008] S.C.C.A. No. 354, there will
    be circumstances where trial delay, even significant trial delay, will be
    caused by “a constellation of explicable factors”.  This is such a case.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[147]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    note three factors in particular.  First, this was an unusual case involving
    previously untested procedures for the disclosure at an accused’s criminal
    trial of information beneficial to the defence that was captured by the reach
    of the confidentiality of information scheme contemplated by s. 38 of the
    CEA.  Significant delay in this case – approximately 18 months – was attributable
    to the need to respond to the appellant’s interests in obtaining such confidential
    information while at the same time protecting
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    ’s national security interests in accordance with the s. 38 legislative scheme.
    Ultimately, this period of delay resulted in the discovery of evidence that
    the appellant’s counsel regarded as critical to the defence.  In this very
    real sense, therefore, the delay associated with the CEA s. 38 disclosure
    proceedings mitigated the prejudice suffered by the appellant and enhanced
    his ability to make full answer and defence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[148]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    this was a complicated case at the pre-trial preparation stage.  Delay was
    caused by the nature of the case itself, including the need to explore and
    obtain information from a host of domestic and foreign witnesses and agencies,
    about events that transpired abroad, during another nation’s civil war.  The
    information at issue included third party records located both in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    and abroad, at least some of which were subject to litigation regarding substantive
    Crown privilege claims, and national security considerations.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[149]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    court has recognized in other contexts that complex cases require substantial
    preparation and court time: see for example, in the context of complex fraud
    cases, <i>R. v.
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Cranston</i>, 2008 ONCA 751, at para. 38.  Similar considerations resonate
    in this case and attenuate the impact of the delay in reaching trial.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[150]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    contrary to the appellant’s submission, the national and international interests
    engaged in this case were proper and important considerations in the balancing
    required by s. 11(b).  Those interests recognized the context of a complicated
    prosecution for offences committed abroad, with national and international
    implications.  The societal interest in the adjudication of this case on
    the merits weighed more heavily in the s. 11(b) balancing exercise than the
    adverse impact of the delay associated with the proceeding.  Although the
    overall delay was most undesirable, it was not unreasonable in the unusual
    circumstances of this case.  The trial judge, therefore, did not err in dismissing
    the appellant’s s. 11(b) <i>Charter</i> applications.  </p>
