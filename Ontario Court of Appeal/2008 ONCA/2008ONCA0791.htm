  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant seeks leave to appeal to this court and, if leave is granted, appeals
    from the summary conviction appeal court judge’s dismissal of his appeal
    from both his conviction and sentence for criminal harassment and uttering
    threats. The appellant argues that his rights under s. 11(b) of the <i>Charter</i> and
    his right to a fair trial were violated by both the ineffective assistance
    of trial counsel and by the trial judge allowing the Crown to reopen its
    case.  The appellant further submits that the trial judge made certain factual
    errors and did not properly weigh the evidence presented at trial.  In our
    view, except for the appellant’s submission regarding the purported violation
    of his s. 11(b) <i>Charter </i>rights, none of the appellant’s allegations
    meet the test for granting leave to appeal to this court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    factual issues raised by the appellant do not appear to have been argued
    before the summary conviction appeal judge and do not raise a question of
    law.  In any event, these issues neither undermine the conviction nor do
    they constitute reviewable error.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    allegations regarding the ineffective assistance of trial counsel and the
    trial judge’s ruling which permitted the Crown to reopen its case were fully
    addressed by the summary conviction appeal judge.  We see no error in the
    summary conviction appeal judge’s analysis, and no question of law arising
    from that decision is in issue.  In our view, the interests of justice do
    not require that leave be granted on these grounds.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    s. 11(b) issue does, however, raise an issue of law that warrants granting
    leave to appeal to this court.  This issue stems from the fact that, on the
    day of trial, the appellant appeared without his lawyer, who was unavailable
    that day but had arranged for substitute counsel to represent the appellant
    at trial.  The appellant’s lawyer also advised the appellant to bring a s.
    11(b) application but, because the necessary transcripts were not available
    at the time, an adjournment would have to be requested.  However, despite
    his lawyer’s arrangement for alternate trial counsel, the appellant refused
    the assistance of the substitute counsel and elected instead to proceed unrepresented
    to trial without bringing a s. 11(b) application.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Duty
    counsel argues before us that the trial judge should have either found a
    way to proceed with the s. 11(b) application without the benefit of the transcripts
    or, alternatively, to refer the appellant to duty counsel in order to receive
    proper advice <i>before</i> electing to proceed with the trial without making
    a s. 11(b) application.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    reject these submissions.  The s. 11(b) application could not proceed that
    day because the necessary transcripts were not available.  Accordingly, the
    trial judge stated that he would grant an adjournment and expressly warned
    the appellant that he “would be ill-advised to go ahead” with the trial that
    day.  The trial judge strongly encouraged the appellant to adjourn the matter
    so as to enable him to pursue the s. 11(b) application at a later date.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    as found by the summary conviction appeal judge, the appellant had received
    legal advice and, accordingly, was well aware of his s. 11(b) rights as well
    as his options – either to proceed that day without a s. 11(b) application
    or, to adjourn the matter to a later date.  In the circumstances, it was
    not necessary, in our view, for the trial judge to refer the appellant to
    duty counsel with respect to the s. 11(b) issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    there is no suggestion that the appellant would have suffered any prejudice
    if the matter had been adjourned to a later date.  The appellant chose to
    proceed as he did, despite warnings to the contrary and, therefore cannot
    now argue that the trial judge should have prevented him from doing so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, leave to appeal is granted with respect to the s. 11(b) issue
    only, while leave to appeal on the other issues is denied.  For the reasons
    set out above, however, the appellant’s appeal on the s. 11(b) issue is dismissed.</p>
