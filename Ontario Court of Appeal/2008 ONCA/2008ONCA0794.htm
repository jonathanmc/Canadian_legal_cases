    award under s. 46(1)3 of the <i>Arbitration Act, 1991,</i> S.O. 1991, c.

    the <i>Public Hospitals Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.40 (“<i>PHA</i>”), a physician’s
    term of appointment to the medical staff of a public hospital is for one
    year.  Accordingly, doctors must apply for reappointment annually.  The <i>PHA</i> further
    provides that the Board of Governors of a hospital has the power to renew
    a physician’s appointment.  The <i>PHA</i> requires that a hospital’s MAC,
    which is comprised of physicians from the hospital in question, must make
    a recommendation regarding a physician’s application for reappointment prior
    to the board’s decision.  The board is not bound by the MAC’s recommendation
    in deciding whether to grant or refuse the application for reappointment.</p>

    Smyth is an orthopaedic surgeon whose privileges at the Hospital were renewed
    annually from 1999 to 2006.  In the spring of 2006, a dispute arose at the
    Hospital in relation to allegations of a refusal by Dr. Smyth to complete
    delinquent patient charts, to provide any on-call services, and verbal abuse
    by Dr. Smyth of other doctors at the Hospital, including the Hospital’s Chief
    of Staff.</p>

    April 2006, the MAC hired a consultant, Dr. Isser Dubinsky, to examine the
    issues in conflict and provide recommendations for resolving them.  Following
    the consultant’s review, he recommended that Dr. Smyth be referred to an
    anger management evaluation and attend a course in communications skills.</p>

    December 8, 2006, the Board of Directors of the Hospital passed Resolution
    107/06, which directed Dr. Smyth to participate in a conflict resolution
    program, to be brokered by Dr. Kaufmann of the Ontario Medical Association,
    as a condition of his continued appointment to the medical staff of the Hospital.  The
    Resolution stipulated that confirmation of enrolment in such a program was
    required before February 1, 2007.</p>

    the fall of 2006, Dr. Smyth submitted his annual application for reappointment
    to the medical staff at the Hospital.  His application was reviewed by the
    MAC, which in reasons dated April 26, 2007, recommended that the Board not
    accept Dr. Smyth’s application for reappointment.  The MAC gave two reasons
    for its recommendation: first, Dr. Smyth had not complied with the expectations
    set out in Board Resolution 107/06; and second, Dr. Smyth would not agree
    to perform minimum one in four on-call services without stipulations as required
    by the MAC.</p>

    staff by submitting a signed letter of resignation no later than September
    11, 2007, with his resignation to be effective no later than October 31,
    2007.  He further ruled that if Dr. Smyth did not provide such a letter,

    Smyth applied under s. 46(1)(3) of the <i>Arbitration Act</i> to the Superior
    Court of Justice seeking to set aside the arbitration ruling on the basis
    that the award dealt with a dispute that the Arbitration Agreement did not
    cover.  The application judge concluded that the arbitration agreement was
    limited to the “Two Specific Issues” in paragraph (c) of the Arbitration
    Agreement and that the arbitrator had improperly heard evidence about, and
    based his decision on, matters outside these issues.  Accordingly, he granted
    the application, set aside the arbitration award, and ordered that a new
    arbitration hearing be held before a different arbitrator to deal with the “Two
    Specific Issues” set out in the Arbitration Agreement.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge said nothing about the standard of review to be applied
    to the arbitrator’s decision.  However, it is clear from his reasons that
    he applied a correctness standard.  He conducted his analysis under s. 46(1)
    of the <i>Arbitration Act</i>, which provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>46(1) On a party’s application, the court may set
    aside an            award on any of the following grounds:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>. . .</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>3.         The award deals with a dispute that the arbitration agreement
    does not cover or contains a decision on a matter that is beyond the scope
    of the agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge referred to the terms of the Arbitration Agreement, focussing
    on the “Two Specific Issues” in paragraph (c).  He referred to the MAC’s
    argument that the arbitration related to these issues <i>and</i> the appropriateness
    of the MAC recommendation <i>and</i> the broader issue of the disposition
    of Dr. Smyth’s application for reappointment.  He rejected the MAC’s submission
    and concluded: “The only two issues to be dealt with at the Arbitration Hearing
    were to be the ‘Two Specific Issues’.”  In doing so, he implicitly applied
    a strict correctness standard of review.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    cannot say that the application judge erred in his implicit application of
    a correctness standard of review.  In <i>Dunsmuir v.
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    New Brunswick</i>, [2008] 1 S.C.R. 190, which was released after the application
    judge’s decision, Bastarache and LeBel JJ. stated, at para. 56, that “[a]n
    exhaustive review is not required in every case to determine the proper standard
    of review.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Dunsmuir</i>,
    the court reduced the standards of review to two – correctness and reasonableness.  In
    its discussion of the correctness standard, Bastarache and LeBel JJ. said,
    at para. 59:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Administrative bodies must also be correct in their
    determinations of true questions of jurisdiction or <i>vires</i>… “Jurisdiction” is
    intended in the narrow sense of whether or not the tribunal had the authority
    to make the inquiry.  In other words, true jurisdiction questions arise where
    the tribunal must explicitly determine whether its statutory grant of power
    gives it the authority to decide a particular matter.  The tribunal must
    interpret the grant of authority correctly or its action will be found to
    be <i>ultra vires</i>… .</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    parity of reasoning, an arbitrator must address the issues, and only the
    issues, referred to him in the arbitration agreement.  In this case, the
    respondent’s position was that the Arbitration Agreement set out two specific
    issues for resolution and did not authorize the arbitrator to go beyond those
    questions in order to determine whether the board of the Hospital should
    accept or reject the respondent’s application for reappointment.  In my view,
    the respondent’s position raised a jurisdictional issue within the description
    above in <i>Dunsmuir</i>.  Accordingly, the application judge’s review of
    the arbitrator’s decision on this issue on a correctness standard was appropriate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning
    to the merits, I do not agree with the application judge’s interpretation
    of the Arbitration Agreement.  On the contrary, in my view the arbitrator’s
    interpretation of his task was precisely right.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Arbitration Agreement was not limited to Dr. Smyth’s response to and compliance
    with Board Resolution 107/06 and the MAC’s on-call requirement.  These are
    listed in paragraph (c)(i) and (ii) of the agreement.  However, paragraph
    (b) also refers to Dr. Smyth’s application for reappointment.  Then the agreement
    sets out that “all the disputes and matters and differences as identified
    above”
    will be referred to arbitration.  Crucially, the agreement continues with
    this language: “this arbitration will be the full and final determination
    with respect to Dr. Smyth’s reapplication for privileges at the Hospital”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect, the application judge’s analysis renders this passage meaningless.
    If the arbitration was limited to considering Dr. Smyth’s compliance with
    the “Two Specific Issues” in paragraph (c) of the agreement, without considering
    the conduct and events leading to the making of the recommendations of the
    MAC, the arbitrator would not have the background necessary to assess whether
    Dr. Smyth’s response to these issues warranted denying his reappointment.  In
    other words, the arbitral award would be nothing more than a determination
    of two issues, not “the full and final determination” of Dr. Smyth’s reapplication.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once
    the jurisdictional issue is disposed of in favour of the arbitrator’s interpretation
    of his mandate, the only remaining question is whether his award was reasonable. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Dunsmuir</i>,
    Bastarache and LeBel JJ. discussed the contents and implications of the reasonableness
    standard of review in this fashion at para. 47:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Reasonableness is a deferential standard animated
    by the principle that underlies the development of the two previous standards
    of reasonableness: certain questions that come before administrative tribunals
    do not lend themselves to one specific, particular result.  Instead, they
    may give rise to a number of possible, reasonable conclusions.  Tribunals
    have a margin of appreciation within the range of acceptable and rational
    solutions.  A court conducting a review for reasonableness inquires into
    the qualities that make a decision reasonable, referring both to the process
    of articulating the reasons and to outcomes.  In judicial review, reasonableness
    is concerned mostly with the existence of justification, transparency and
    intelligibility within the decision-making process.  But it is also concerned
    with whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes
    which are defensible in respect of the facts and law. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the arbitrator’s decision was clearly reasonable within these parameters.  The
    arbitrator was a senior and experienced doctor and administrator chosen by
    the parties.  He received substantial affidavit evidence and heard oral testimony
    from the witnesses, including Dr. Smyth.  He prepared an 11-page arbitral
    award.  He specifically addressed the two issues in paragraph (c) of the
    Arbitration Agreement and found that Dr. Smyth had remedied neither.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    arbitrator then summarized the situation and his views about it in forthright
    fashion:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The burden of evidence presented clearly supports
    the recurrence of disruptive and aggressive behaviour by Dr. Smyth over a
    prolonged period of time.  Dr. Smyth’s behaviour has been bullying, obstructive
    and manipulative.  Dr. Smyth has chosen to ignore the many opportunities
    offered by the MAC and his colleagues to meet deadlines and avoid this regrettable
    outcome.  In fact, Dr. Smyth has consistently responded to his colleagues’ attempts
    to resolve the problems in a professional, amicable and timely manner with
    obstruction and manipulation.  Dr. Smyth has also exhibited a complete disregard
    and lack of respect for the authority of the MAC and the Board.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is clear that Dr. Smyth’s behaviour has had
    a profound impact on his colleagues, having permanently damaged professional
    relationships and trust between many of his colleagues and himself.  His
    behaviour has created a poisoned environment which has extended beyond the
    Medical Staff to involve the Board and the community.  Such an environment
    is not in the best interests of the hospital, the patients and the community.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Dr. Smyth has demonstrated no insight into his
    role in creating this environment, no understanding of the impact of his
    behaviour on his colleagues and no understanding of the permanent breaches
    in the relationships with his colleagues for which he is responsible.  Most
    importantly, Dr. Smyth appears not to grasp the essential importance of collegial
    relationships to the continuum of patient care.  It is simply not credible
    that granting renewal of appointment to Dr. Smyth will allow restoration
    of the Hospital and the Medical Staff to the level of function essential
    to optimally serve their patients and the community.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, these conclusions were open to the arbitrator in light of the documentary
    and oral evidence before him.  The conclusions easily fulfil the “justification,
    transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process” component
    of the <i>Dunsmuir</i> description of reasonableness.  Moreover, the arbitrator’s
    decision clearly comes “within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which
    are defensible in respect of the facts and law.”</p>
