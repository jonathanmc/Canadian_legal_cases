    respondent personal plaintiff is a prominent citizen and businessman in northern
    <st1:State w:st="on">

    Lakes near New Liskeard. In the late 1990s, the respondent acquired 2.787
    hectares of Crown land adjacent to his home on which he built a private three-hole
    golf course. In 1998, he wanted to expand the golf course to nine holes and
    sought to acquire 23.5 hectares more land, including 10.5 hectares of Crown
    land to do so. The project also required certain governmental approvals including
    respecting environmental issues involving the effect of a golf course on
    the lake and the adjacent environment. Local residents and cottagers had
    concerns about the project and had retained their own environmental consultant.</p>

    plaintiffs sued the newspaper for libel. They claimed that the sting of the
    article was that it suggested that Peter Grant used political influence gained
    by his friendship with the Premier and his donations to the Conservative
    Party to circumvent local citizens’ concerns and the normal approval process
    for a project that would affect the environment. The defendants’
    position was that the article did not and could not have that meaning; rather,
    it documented local residents’ concerns that because of his influence and
    political ties, Mr. Grant’s project would be given special treatment by the
    government. </p>

      <st1:place w:st="on">
      England</st1:country-region>
    at the time of the trial. The trial judge specifically rejected the defence
    of qualified privilege and sent the case to the jury. The jury found the
    newspaper liable and awarded general damages in the amount of $400,000, aggravated
    damages in the amount of $25,000 and punitive damages in the amount of $1
    million in favour of Mr. Grant and general damages of $50,000 in favour of

    1993, Mr. Grant applied to purchase Crown land adjacent to his property.
    In 1997, the Ministry of Natural Resources agreed to sell him 2.787 hectares
    of Crown land on which he proceeded to build a three-hole private golf course
    named Frog’s Breath. There was no public consultation or prior approval process
    for that construction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since
    1998, Mr. Grant has held an annual charitable golf tournament on the course,
    with proceeds donated to local public projects. Mr Grant has been a long-time
    supporter of the provincial Progressive Conservative political party as well
    as a long-time friend and financial supporter of former premier Mike Harris
    who, it was widely known, had attended the golf tournament and been a guest
    at Mr. Grant’s home.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    1998, Mr. Grant began to take steps to acquire more land in order to expand
    the golf course by a factor of ten to a “world class” nine-hole course. This
    required a further purchase of 13 hectares of private land as well 10.5 hectares
    of Crown land. It also involved an approval process that included addressing
    provincial environmental concerns as well as municipal zoning issues. Neighbouring
    cottagers objected to the proposed expansion. They wrote many letters to
    the municipality as well as to the MNR raising concerns for the lake and
    its surrounding environment, as well as for the users of the lake both during
    construction and after. Following reports from Mr. Grant’s environmental
    consultants and planners, further letters of objection were sent, raising
    concerns including: the quantity of water needed to maintain the golf course,
    noise and erosion from the construction, the impact of run-off and chemicals
    on water quality and potability, preserving the character of the lake, the
    effect of Mr. Grant’s economic and political power on government decision-making,
    the singular benefit of the development to Mr. Grant and that the proposal
    had been launched in the winter months when cottagers were not around. Eighteen
    cottagers retained their own environmental expert who confirmed that the
    development could detrimentally affect the lake and that Mr.&nbsp;Grant’s
    reports were not fully responsive to the concerns.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Hudson Lakes Association held a public meeting on January 13, 2001 where
    representatives for Mr. Grant and GFP Inc. were invited to explain the proposal.
    On that same day, the defendant Toronto Star published a front page article
    written by the defendant Bill Schiller about another golf course development
    called Osprey Links near
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City

    North Bay. The article reported that friends of Premier Harris were able
    to overcome environmental concerns of the MNR in order to obtain approval

    meeting was very well attended and everyone was talking about the Osprey
    Links article and a possible parallel with the Grant proposal. In response
    to a statement in the meeting notice that a decision would be made following
    a 30-day period, one resident expressed the concern that the application “seems
    like it’s a done deal.” The MNR representative responded that the decision
    had not been made, that the Ministry of the Environment had yet to do a technical
    review and that the timing of the decision was up to the district manager.</p>

    January 15, 2001 Dr. Lorrie Clark, a professor at
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Trent
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    University, a cottager and secretary of the Hudson Lakes Association, e-mailed
    Bill Schiller congratulating him on his Osprey Links story and telling him
    about the coincidence with their issue. She explained the facts of their
    situation and the concerns of the cottagers and residents: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Basically, the situation is this: Peter Grant, multimillionaire owner of Grant Forest Products
    in Englehart and Mike Harris supporter and crony, is trying to buy 40 acres
    of Crown Land behind his “cottage” on Twin Lakes, just west of New Liskeard,
    for a private golf course…Everyone thinks it’s a done deal, because of Grant’s
    influence (he employs 10,000 people in Northern Ontario) but most of all
    his Mike Harris ties…There has been a constant sense from the beginning that
    this is, as one cottager put it last night, ‘a done deal,’ and that nothing
    we can do to stop a development that is NOT in the public interest – but
    obviously only a very private one – will make any difference. Everyone suspects –
    although I do grant that this is perhaps all unfounded – that there may be
    political pressure on the MNR people to give Mr. Grant what he wants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Other
    local residents also contacted Mr. Schiller expressing similar concerns.
    Mr.&nbsp;Schiller decided to pursue the story by doing research and conducting
    interviews. He first researched Mr. Grant’s political contributions. From
    Elections Ontario he learned that Mr. Grant and his companies had donated
    approximately $95,000 between 1995 and 2000 to the Progressive Conservatives,
    $58,534.30 of it in 1999. Mr. Grant and his companies had also donated $14,000
    to Mike Harris’ leadership campaign in 1990. Between 1999 and 2000 GFP Inc.
    donated $5,000 to the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Mississauga riding association of the Minister of Natural Resources, Mr.
    Snobelen. Mr. Schiller confirmed that Premier Harris had attended Mr. Grant’s
    charity golf tournament. He learned that Mr. Grant had hired as a lobbyist,
    Peter Birnie, a close friend of Premier Harris and a member of his
    <st1:place w:st="on">

line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Later
    in January, Mr. Schiller went to New Liskeard where he met with several local
    residents, did extensive interviews where he took detailed notes, received
    numerous documents including letters and reports about the proposal and heard
    more about their fears that the proposal was a
    “done deal”. He also went to the local newspaper and the registry office
    to obtain information. In
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto, he looked at Mr. Grant’s court divorce file to get financial information.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Schiller also attempted to interview Mr. Grant and obtain his side of the
    story in February 2001. He first spoke with Bob Fleet, who was handling the
    application for Mr. Grant. Although Mr. Fleet originally agreed to a phone
    interview, he subsequently refused on Mr. Grant’s instructions and instead
    asked Mr. Schiller to put his questions in writing. Mr. Schiller then wrote
    requesting an interview with Peter Grant. The letter was answered by Mr.
    Grant’s lawyer who referred Mr. Schiller to the public record and said that
    Mr. Grant would consider answering questions put in writing. Mr. Schiller
    then wrote asking some questions, to which the lawyer responded that his
    client’s business affairs were private and that he would not discuss his
    personal affairs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Schiller collected more information over the next few months from a cottager,
    the town’s planning consultant and from MNR officials. He collected over
    180 documents during his research. He tried to speak to Mr. Grant’s golf
    course consultant but the consultant had been instructed by Mr. Fleet not
    to talk to him. On May 24, 2001, Mr. Schiller received a notice of a public
    meeting to be held on June 23, 2001 regarding a proposed amendment to the
    town’s by-laws permitting the golf course expansion. He then drafted his
    story and worked on it with his editor. On June 1, 2001 he sent Mr. Grant
    a letter with 16 detailed questions about the proposal, seeking Mr. Grant’s
    reaction to the cottagers’ concerns and about his connections to the Conservative
    Party and to Mike Harris. Again, Mr. Grant’s lawyer replied refusing to answer
    any questions. Mr. Schiller wrote one more letter with further questions.
    The response from Mr. Grant’s lawyer was a threat of a libel action.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    all of his research and interviews, Mr. Schiller never asked any MNR or any
    other government official to react to the suggestion that the proposal was
    a “done deal,” nor did he seek to question Mike Harris or anyone connected
    to him to ask him the same question. In his cross-examination, Mr. Schiller
    stated that he never had any information that Mr. Grant had sought to use
    political influence or money to affect the approval process. He did not intend
    the article to suggest that Mr. Grant used his position of power to circumvent
    the approval process. Rather, his intent and understanding of the story was
    to question whether Mr. Grant’s status and position of influence would impact
    the approval process. He testified that it never crossed his mind to call
    the Premier’s office, because he did not think the issue was the Premier,
    but rather Peter Grant and the cottagers’ concerns. However, he further testified
    that had he called the Premier’s office and received a denial, he would have
    included it in the story. Similarly, as he viewed the story to be about the
    cottagers’ perception of a “done deal” and not about any actual political
    or other influence being exerted, Mr. Schiller did not include in the article
    Lorrie Clark’s reference in her e-mail to the fact that people suspected
    political pressure on the MNR but that those suspicions might be unfounded.</p>

    take pictures. He also took pictures from a canoe in the lake. Mr. Grant
    saw Mr. Slaughter, thought he might be from the Star, and instructed an employee,
    Mr. Webster, to find out who Mr. Slaughter was and to try to keep him there.
    In cross-examination, Mr. Webster said that Mr. Grant told him to block off
    the photographer’s car until the police arrived. Mr. Webster parked in front
    of Mr. Slaughter’s car on a narrow gravel rode to try to block him. Mr. Slaughter
    then went around Mr. Webster and narrowly missed the ditch. Mr. Webster never

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>FEATURE
    WRITER</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><u>Saturday
      Special</u></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>NEW LISKEARD –
    During the past decade, millionaire lumber magnate Peter Grant – one of the
    most powerful business people in northern
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario – has been generous with Mike Harris and the Conservatives.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In 1990, Grant,
    through his companies, gave Harris more than $14,000 to help him win the
    Conservative leadership.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In 1999, Grant
    poured $45,000 into Conservative pockets to speed their re-election, followed
    by another $21,000 last year.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Of this $80,000,
    at least $5,000 went to Natural Resources Minister John Snobelen and his
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Mississauga riding association.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>But Peter Grant
    also wants something from the government.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Here, on a tiny
    peninsula on a cottage-speckled lake, where families have come for generations,
    Grant wants to take three small golf holes on his property and expand them
    into a 3,290-yard, nine-hole course.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>To do so, he
    needs the Harris government – with the support of Snobelen’s ministry – to
    sell him 10.5 hectares of crown land and approve the project.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The planned
    course will be private, <i>so</i> private in fact, it will be for Grant’s
    own “personal use and enjoyment.”</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>But in the minds
    of many who own cottages here on
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Twin
    <st1:PlaceType
w:st="on">
    Lakes, about 500 kilometres north of
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto, Grant’s dream of carving a course out of the northern wilderness
    for his own pleasure, is a nightmare.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>“Herbicides,
    pesticides, fertilizers, will all wash into our lake,” insists Bonnie Taylor,
    who might be forgiven for sounding a little proprietary. Her pioneering family
    first built on this spring-fed lake nearly 60 years ago.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Last winter,
    she wrote the province to say she’s worried about the impact the course could
    have on lake and well water – especially, she said, “with Walkerton still
    fresh on everyone’s mind.”</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>For his part,
    Grant refuses to be interviewed.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>“Our client …
    does not intend to discuss his personal affairs with you,” his lawyers informed
    The Star by letter.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>When a Star
    photographer went to take pictures at the site this month, men the OPP believe
    were Grant employees, accused the photographer of trespassing. They then
    tried to drive the photographer’s vehicle off a public road, and finally
    followed the photographer out of town for almost 20 kilometres.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>But for concerned
    cottagers back at lakeside – the issue is water.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Grant already
    has provincial permission to draw as much as 300,000 litres per day from
    the lake to water his three golf holes.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>According to
    environment ministry guidelines, the same amount of treated water could support
    a community of 750 to 1,500 people.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>And ratepayers
    worry that if Grant’s plan goes ahead, his need for water will grow.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It’s a worry
    not without foundation: some 18-hole golf courses in the north have provincial
    permits to take as much as 2.2 million litres of water per day.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Grant’s expanded
    course would also clear trees from almost 23.5 hectares in total: 10.5 hectares
    of crown land, and another 13 hectares of privately held land he also intends
    to buy for the project.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Perhaps most
    worrisome from the cottagers’ perspective, planning documents show the course
    will use $20,000 worth of pesticides annually, including small amounts of
    Daconil, a highly effective pesticide that is also highly toxic to fish and
    invertebrates.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>But locals aren’t
    the only ones concerned about Grant’s plans. Officials from the Ministry
    of Natural Resources are too. Currently conducting a limited environmental
    assessment, they’ve informed Grant of at least a dozen concerns they have
    about the project, from potential effects on water quality, to the impact
    on lake levels.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Grant’s consultants
    are preparing a response.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>But the ministry’s
    concerns are small comfort to cottagers.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>They know the
    expressed concerns of government officials don’t always mean much when it
    comes to development projects led by supporters of the Premier.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>“Everyone thinks
    it’s a done deal because of Grant’s influence – but most of all his Mike
    Harris ties,” says Lorrie Clark, who owns a cottage on
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">
    Twin
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Lakes.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Earlier this
    year, the local cottagers’ association invited Grant’s consultants, as well
    as ministry officials to a meeting to discuss Grant’s proposal. A number
    of cottagers brought copies of a Toronto Star article detailing how the Premier’s
    best friend Peter Minogue complained “at political levels” to try to get
    his
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    North Bay golf course and subdivision approved in the face of opposition
    from the Ministry of Natural Resources.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Minogue’s partners
    in that venture, known as Osprey Links, included the president of Harris’ riding
    association and a veritable Who’s Who of Harris’
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    North Bay friends. Ministry objections were overruled just 12 days after
    a senior bureaucrat warned by memo that Minogue had begun complaining.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>With that experience
    in mind, lawyer Peter Ramsay, a ratepayer and cottager rose at the public
    meeting here and put his concerns bluntly.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>“Is this (Grant)
    project going to be decided by the Ministry of Natural Resources?” he asked
    officials present. “Or is it going to be decided by Queen’s Park?”</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A ministry official
    at the meeting, Greg Gillespie, said he couldn’t speak for what happens at
    Queen’s Park.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>“But we did
    our job,” he said of the Osprey experience.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Such suspicions
    and anxiety over the approval process have set the stage for a classic confrontation,
    which – in the cottagers’ view – pits the public good of ordinary Ontarians,
    many of whom are senior citizens, against a single, powerful, private interest:
    Peter Grant.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>“This is a development
    that is not in the public interest,” cottage owner Clark emphasizes, “but
    only a very private one.”</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>For an outsider,
    however, looking at the history of the lake, one might think Grant is fighting
    an uphill battle.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>After all, in
    1985 the Ontario Municipal Board shut down a proposal to build a small subdivision
    on
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Twin
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Lakes out of concerns about potential environmental damage.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The board – a
    kind of court of appeal for developers and citizens who disagree on a development – sided
    with a consultant who argued that the lake was too sensitive, teetering on
    overdevelopment with 200 cottages, and any additional building might constitute
    an environmental hazard.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Those arguments
    won the day.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>But Grant is
    undaunted.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Today, the same
    consultant who convinced the board to block that development more than 15
    years ago, now consults for Grant.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Michael Michalski
    argues that Grant’s development can be built with minimum impact and that “everything
    feasible” will be done to keep contaminants on site.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Not to be outdone,
    local citizens have hired their own consultants, Gartner Lee. They say neither
    Michalski nor anyone else can guarantee the lake’s safety.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>And so the scientific
    lines have been drawn in the sand. </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>But if politics
    and power were to have any bearing on the matter, some feel Grant would have
    the upper hand.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In this rough
    and rugged stretch of northern
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario, where local economies depend largely on timber and tourism, Grant
    is a powerful presence.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>His company,
    Grant Forest Products, is an important local employer. The company’s radio
    ads, which continually remind locals that Grant is “using our forests wisely,” are
    part of public consciousness. And every autumn, a charity golf tournament
    Grant holds using two public courses – the tournament culminates at his mini-course –
    heralds the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    high point of this area’s social season. It always makes front-page news.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>So did the Premier’s
    visit here last fall, when he attended a post-tournament reception for more
    than 600 at Grant’s palatial home.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Grant, who has
    been running the event since 1998, proudly presented a cheque that day for
    $300,000 to help build a local senior’s home.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Press accounts
    note that he’s raised about $1 million for local causes, including area golf
    courses, over three years.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Up north, the
    charity event has distinguished him.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>So has his selection
    of lobbyists down south at Queen’s Park.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>When it comes
    to looking after business interests there, Grant depends on
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    North Bay lobbyist Peter Birnie. Records at Elections Ontario show Birnie
    is vice-president of Harris’ riding association.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Meanwhile, on
    the personal front, Grant maintains a reputation for living large.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>His home and
    corporate compound in the bush dwarfs the dozens of cottages that surround
    it.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>His 14,500 square-foot
    house on 4.5 hectares of lavishly landscaped property, was once appraised
    at $1.9 million. Neighbours note the occasional helicopter coming and going
    through the bush.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The seven-bedroom
    main house has an indoor squash court with viewing gallery, a fully equipped
    gymnasium, and a Jacuzzi that can accommodate 15 people.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Outside, tennis
    courts are equipped with banks of lights that illuminate the night sky. And
    down on the water, there’s a 1,500-square-foot boat house.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>There is also
    his three-hole mini-course – that Grant calls Frog’s Breath – which can be
    configured to play as a tiny five.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Records show
    these holes were built on almost three hectares of crown land, which the
    province sold to Grant in April, 1998 for $20,000.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>But records
    also show that two months earlier, in February, 1998, Grant had also applied
    to buy the 10.5 hectares he’s still pursuing today.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>These developments
    have residents up in arms.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>“It’s difficult
    living here and watching all this go on,” says Nancy Kramp, a mother of four
    who, like Grant, lives permanently on
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">
    Twin
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Lakes.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>“It used to
    be dead silence out here. There was nothing but the sounds of wildlife. Now,
    there are always (golf course) machines running.”</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Kramp can’t
    comprehend how the provincial government can think of selling 10.5 hectares
    of land so that one man may build a golf course for his own enjoyment.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>She remembers
    a run-in she had with the Ministry of Natural Resources not so long ago over
    a sandbox.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>“Around 1994,
    the ministry told us to move a sandbox we’d erected for our son,” Kramp recalls, “four
    planks with sand in the middle, because it was on crown land. This sandbox
    seemed to be interfering with the natural habitat of the area. And now a
    nine-hole golf course is okay?”</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It’s not okay
    yet.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The Harris government
    has not sold the property to him.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Still, local
    politicians are preparing the way.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Today, five
    politicians who represent the people of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">
    Hudson
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Township here (population: 501), are scheduled to meet to discuss a motion
    to amend local zoning bylaws and, according to a published notice, “permit
    the construction of a personal golf course – for the personal use of the
    property owner.”</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Local councillor
    Clinton Edwards says he doesn’t really want to say whether he’ll support
    it.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>“I’m in a bit
    of a bind here,” he says, somewhat haltingly. “My wife works for him (Grant).
    Employment is very hard to get up here,” he adds.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>News of impending
    zoning changes even before the government has sold Grant the land makes some
    cottagers distrustful about what might happen next.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>“The people
    on this lake aren’t mega-millionaires,” says Alexandra Skindra, mother, grandmother
    and property owner.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>“They’re just
    regular people. Hard-working people. This shouldn’t be happening.”</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Skindra and
    her husband Arkadis, 68, a retired nuclear plant designer, were planning
    on spending their retirement on the lake.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>“I grew up here,” explains
    Alexandra. “My kids grew up here. And I was hoping our five grandchildren
    could come here every summer.”</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>“We don’t have
    anything against Peter,” Arkadis offers, hammer in hand as he renovates the
    front room of their cottage overlooking the water.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>“But I can’t
    see how this can go ahead and not damage the lake and the environment.”</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Down the way,
    Ira and Marion Murphy have spent 56 years on a tiny stretch of land that
    joins
    <st1:PlaceName

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Looking trim
    at 75, Ira, a retired Hydro supervisor, can point to the shore where he built
    a two-storey tree house for his granddaughters 18 summers ago.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>For him, lake
    life is a precious thing, something interwoven with family.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>“You know, we’ve
    known Peter since he was 3 years old,” says Murphy, a handsome, gray-haired
    man with a taste for the outdoors.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>“We’ve got nothing
    against him. We’re just concerned about the lake, that’s all.”</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Rudi Ptok, 71,
    says he’s worried about run-off, and not just with pesticides, he says, but
    with the 400 kilograms of fertilizers per year that will be needed to keep
    Grant’s course green too.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>“They’re probably
    going to have to blast out rock to build too,” he says.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Ptok says Grant’s
    consultants have confirmed they may well have to dynamite.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Looking worriedly
    out at the lake, Ptok says, “I don’t even want to think about it.”</p>

    defence of qualified privilege was available if the newspaper could demonstrate
    that (1) there was a compelling moral or social duty to publish the article
    containing the statement and (2) a reciprocal interest on the part of the
    public to receive the information, as long as the report was published without
    malice. It has always been the role of the judge to determine if the defamatory
    material was published on an occasion of qualified privilege, as defined.
    If so, then it is the role of the jury to decide if the publication was made
    with malice as its dominant motive, that is, not for the purpose that attracted
    the privilege but for an ulterior purpose. If so, the defence would fail.<i></i></p>

    two seminal cases in the House of Lords, <i>Reynolds v. Times Newspapers</i>,
    [1999] 4 All E.R. 609, and <i>Jameel (Mohammed) v. Wall Street Journal Europe
    Sprl</i>, [2007] 1 A.C. 359, that court recognized that the traditional defence
    of qualified privilege, which protected reports on matters of public interest
    published without malice, was not sufficient to adequately protect and foster
    freedom of expression and the public’s right to know and debate freely matters
    of public interest. However, the Law Lords also recognized that defining
    political matters as matters of public interest would result in an overextension
    of the rights of the media by making it too difficult for people whose reputations
    were unfairly, but not maliciously impugned, to obtain redress. The House
    of Lords therefore developed in <i>Reynolds</i> and subsequently strengthened
    in <i>Jameel</i>, a new defence intended to strike a balance between the
    interests of individuals in protecting their reputations on the one hand,
    and the right of the public to access information on matters of legitimate
    public interest and the ability of the media to fairly and responsibly report
    on such matters on the other. <i></i></p>

    this court followed the lead of the House of Lords and adopted the <i>Reynolds/Jameel</i> defence
    of “public interest responsible journalism” as a new defence, separate and
    distinct from qualified privilege. Sharpe J.A. described the test and its
    availability in the following manner at para. 144:<i></i></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>To avail itself
    of the public interest responsible journalism test a media defendant must
    show that it took reasonable steps in the circumstances to ensure that the
    story was fair and its contents were true and accurate. This is not too much
    to ask of the media. What constitutes reasonable steps will depend of course
    upon the circumstances of the particular case. In assessing whether the media
    has met this standard the court will consider the ten factors outlined by
    the House of Lords in <i>Reynolds</i>…, or such of them –
    or any other factors – as may be relevant in the circumstances. As <i>Reynolds</i> and
    subsequent authorities have noted, these factors are not a list of hurdles
    that media defendants must negotiate; rather, they are indicia of whether
    the media were truly acting in the public interest in the circumstances.</p>

line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Jameel</i>,
    the House of Lords made it clear that the new defence was intended to be
    applied in a manner that promotes the publication of fair reports on matters
    of public interest. This new approach was developed in a context where, following <i>Reynolds </i>in
    1999, trial judges, including in <i>Jameel,</i> had tended to treat the <i>Reynolds</i> factors
    in a very restrictive way, making it difficult for media defendants to meet
    all ten factors. An example of the approach intended by the House of Lords
    can be seen in the decision of the Privy Council in the case of <i>Bonnick
    v. Morris,</i> [2003] 1 A.C. 300, on appeal from the Court of Appeal of Jamaica.
    In <i>Bonnick</i>, the Privy Council considered the defence of responsible
    journalism in the context of an article reporting on the termination of the
    plaintiff’s employment from the Jamaica Commodity Trading Company in possible
    connection with some unusual contracts. The plaintiff argued that the article
    was libellous because it suggested that his employment had been terminated
    on account of his involvement with a particularly bad contract, and that
    the defendant reporter had not made sufficient inquiries or attempted to
    include the plaintiff’s own explanation in the article. The Privy Council
    held that, although the failure to make further inquiries and include the
    plaintiff’s explanation was unfortunate, the article overall was a piece
    of responsible journalism notwithstanding that it was “near the borderline” (paras.
    27-28).</p>

    application in

    on a matter of public interest at para. 89:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    the more the public is misinformed and the individual harmed, if the allegation

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    other conditions identified by the House of Lords were noted in <i>Cusson</i>.
    The first is that in <i>Reynolds</i>, Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead cautioned
    that “[t]he court should be slow to conclude that a publication was not in
    the public interest and, therefore, the public had no right to know, especially
    when the information is in the field of political discussion. Any lingering
    doubts should be resolved in favour of publication (at p. 205F A.C.)” (para.
    90). The second condition, as explained by Lord Bingham of Cornhill in separate
    reasons in <i>Jameel</i>, is that the publisher must establish that it acted
    responsibly with respect to the story as a whole, and if it does so, then
    it need not pass the responsible journalism test for each defamatory statement “if
    it can establish that it acted responsibly in relation to the story as a
    whole assuming that ‘the thrust of the article is true, and the public interest
    condition is satisfied’ (at para. 34)” (para.98).<b> </b></p>

    order to better understand the approach a court should take when considering
    the responsible journalism defence, it is useful to observe how Lord Hoffman
    applied the <i>Reynolds</i> test in <i>Jameel</i>. Although each of the Law
    Lords in <i>Jameel</i> wrote separate speeches, the majority concurred in
    principle with the reasons of Lord Hoffman on this issue. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Jameel,</i> the
    newspaper had published an article about certain Saudi Arabian corporations
    whose bank accounts were being monitored at the request of the US Treasury,
    to ensure that they were not funding terrorists. The plaintiff was named
    as one of the monitored corporations. The newspaper tried to reach the plaintiff
    for comment, but was only able to speak to a representative who said he had
    no knowledge of being monitored, would not give permission to publish that
    response, and asked to delay publication for 24 hours. However, the newspaper
    went ahead and published the story before a representative could get back
    to them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lord
    Hoffman first looked at whether the subject-matter of the article was a matter
    of public interest. This is a question of law for the judge. The test is
    not the traditional one of privileged occasion where the judge decides whether
    there is a duty to report the matter and a corresponding interest by the
    public in learning about it. Nor is it a question of categorizing the content.
    Rather, the judge decides, not whether the matter is one in which the public
    is interested, but whether it is, as a matter of law, a public matter. In
    making this determination, he said, it is important to look at the article
    as a whole and not to isolate the defamatory statement (para. 48). In that
    case, the thrust of the article was that the Saudi government was co-operating
    with the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">US</st1:country-region>
    in the fight against terrorism, clearly a matter of public interest.</p>

line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lord
    Hoffman then considered whether the newspaper was justified in including
    the defamatory statement about the plaintiff. He noted that the more serious
    the defamatory allegation, “the more important it is that it should make
    a real contribution to the public interest element in the article” (para.
    51). Additionally, inclusion of the defamatory statement may also be viewed
    as a matter of editorial judgment, which the courts are not to second-guess
    with the benefit of hindsight. Lord Hoffman concluded that in that case,
    including the names of the companies involved was an important part of the
    story.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once
    the article including the defamatory statement(s) passes the “public interest” criterion,
    then the inquiry turns to whether the steps the journalist took to gather
    and verify the story were fair and responsible. This is where the ten, and
    possibly other factors, are to be assessed, but in a practical and flexible
    manner depending on the facts and circumstances of each case. In that case,
    Lord Hoffman analysed the responsible journalism aspect by looking at three
    factors that arose in the case: (1) the steps taken to verify the story,
    (2) the opportunity given to Jameel to comment prior to publication, and
    (3) the propriety of publication in light of
    <st1:place

    <st1:country-region w:st="on">US</st1:country-region>
    policy at the time.</p>

line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the context of verification of the story, Lord Hoffman pointed out that in
    most cases the responsible journalism defence requires that the journalist
    honestly and reasonably believed that the impugned statement was true. However,
    he pointed out that in some cases, referred to as
    “reportage,” the publisher need not subscribe to any belief in the truth
    of the statement if the public interest element “lies simply in the fact
    that the statement was made” (para. 62).<a href="#_ftn1"

    fair comment, which I will discuss later in these reasons.</p>

line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    summarize, the essence of the defence, is that the matter reported is of
    public interest, that it was appropriate in that context to include the defamatory
    statement as part of the story, and that the publisher took reasonable and
    fair steps, given the defamatory statement, to verify the story including
    giving the subject of the story a chance to respond before publishing it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    case at bar was tried following the <i>Reynolds</i> and <i>Jameel</i> decisions,
    but before this court had made the responsible journalism defence the law
    of
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario in <i>Cusson</i>. The defendants argued both the qualified privilege
    and the <i>Reynolds/Jameel</i> defences, and in respect of the latter, the
    defendants made submissions to the trial judge with respect to the ten factors
    for assessing whether they were entitled to rely on the defence of responsible
    journalism.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    advised the trial judge that the applicability of the defence was a question
    of law for the judge, who has to weigh all the appropriate factors to decide
    both public interest and responsible acting. Counsel also acknowledged that
    in the English cases, there is often a role for the jury in deciding certain
    factual issues that will inform the judge’s application of the test.<a href="#_ftn2"

    of responsible journalism or qualified privilege, the case may be put to
    the jury to answer relevant questions to determine the meaning of the words
    and whether they are defamatory, whether the defendant was motivated by malice,
    and to decide the quantum of damages. In this case, counsel advised the trial
    judge that there was no need to involve the jury before determining the applicability
    of the defence. In fact, if the defence succeeded, there would be no need
    to put the case to the jury at all.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the approach taken in this case is not one that should normally
    be followed in a libel case tried with a jury. In fairness to the trial judge
    and to counsel, both very experienced and knowledgeable libel lawyers, they
    were all proceeding in new legal territory, as the courts still are with
    this defence.<a href="#_ftn3"

    having heard all of the evidence, should have the opportunity to decide all
    relevant questions, regardless of the trial judge’s decision on the availability
    of the defence of public interest responsible journalism.  Done this way,
    if the trial judge’s ruling is in error, the Court of Appeal will have the
    necessary information from the jury to properly substitute its decision if
    the circumstances warrant.  Where the Court of Appeal does not have the benefit
    of the jury’s findings on such questions as meaning, other defences and damages,
    the court has no choice but to send the matter back for a new trial in the
    event of an error by the trial judge.</p>

    to the point in this case, the main issue to be decided was the meaning of
    the story and of the statements that were alleged to be defamatory. The plaintiff’s
    position was that he was being accused of using improper influence and financial
    contributions to the governing political party in order to obtain government
    co-operation for the sale of Crown lands and approval of his golf course,
    despite environmental concerns and objections by cottagers. The newspaper
    and the writer denied that the article had or could have that meaning. Their
    position was that the article simply outlined cottagers’
    concerns that Mr. Grant’s influential position in the community, his political
    ties flowing from his friendship with Mike Harris and his financial contributions
    to the Conservative Party would result in the project’s approval, despite
    local citizens’ objections and the fact that potential environmental impacts
    had been flagged. They had no information to suggest that Mr. Grant had sought
    to use political influence to circumvent the ordinary process, and therefore
    they did not write that in the story.</p>

line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Without
    first having the jury decide whether the article had either of these meanings
    (or some other meaning), the trial judge was not in a position to accurately
    and effectively weigh the factors for responsible journalism. An obvious
    example is the <i>Reynolds</i> factor of the seriousness of the defamatory
    charge. In this case, where the sting of the libel depends on the meaning,
    the meaning will drive the analysis of the adequacy of the steps taken by
    the journalist to investigate and verify the information. The more serious
    the defamatory charge, the heavier is the obligation on the journalist.</p>

    issue of which meaning should be considered by the trial judge when deciding
    whether the responsible journalism defence applies arose in <i>Bonnick</i>,
    also decided by Lord Nicholls of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Birkenhead. His conclusion, on behalf of the Privy Council, was that “a journalist
    should not be penalised for making a wrong decision on a question of meaning
    on which different people might reasonably take different views” (para. 24).
    The court can take this into account when assessing whether the journalist
    has met the necessary criteria for the responsible journalism defence because,
    in his view, <a name=para22>“the question being considered is one of conduct</a>” (para.
    22). However, Lord Nicholls of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Birkenhead noted this caveat: that a journalist is expected to perceive the
    meaning an ordinary, reasonable reader would give to the impugned words,
    so that the more obvious the defamatory meaning, the less weight the court
    will attribute to other possible meanings (para. 24). </p>

    different approach on how to determine the meaning of the impugned words
    for the purpose of the responsible journalism defence was suggested by the
    Court of Appeal in <i>Jameel, </i>[2005] 4 All E.R. 356. The Court of Appeal
    expressed the view that had the <i>Reynolds</i> defence turned on whether
    the impugned words bore either the more or less serious meaning as contended
    by each of the parties, then the jury should have been asked to choose the
    meaning. In that case, the two meanings were close enough that it was not
    necessary to involve the jury at that stage (para. 84). I note that in <i>Jameel,</i> although
    one of the Law Lords invited the court to adopt the <i>Bonnick </i>approach
    to this issue, the others did not address it (para. 136).</p>

    is clear that both substantively and procedurally, courts must be able to
    be flexible when dealing with the responsible journalism defence. I would
    not want to set down a hard and fast rule about how a trial court should
    proceed. Each case will necessarily turn on its own facts, and the issues
    that arise from those facts. However, in this case, it was necessary for
    counsel and the trial judge to address the major issue in dispute, the meaning
    of the impugned statements, and to have that issue decided by the jury. <i></i></p>

    is not sufficient for the trial judge to find that the impugned words are
    capable of bearing both meanings. That is merely the exercise of a gatekeeper
    function before the meaning issue goes to the jury. Fulfilling this gatekeeper
    function does not assist the judge to properly apply the responsible journalism
    factors in a case where the meaning is the key issue. The optimal procedure
    in this case would be to ask the jury to determine the meaning of the article
    as part of reaching its verdicts. With complete answers from the jury in
    hand, the trial judge could then make the legal ruling on the responsible
    journalism defence. If the jury accepted the defendants’ meaning, that would
    inform the judge’s analysis of whether the steps taken by the journalist
    to verify the story were reasonable and fair in the circumstances. If the
    jury accepted the plaintiffs’ meaning, the analysis could be different. In
    this scenario, the trial judge could decide how much, if any weight, should
    be given to the meaning the defendants understood and intended, in light
    of the jury’s conclusion.<i></i></p>

    the pre-charge submissions of counsel, which included submissions on the
    traditional defence of qualified privilege as well as on the new <i>Reynolds/Jameel</i> defence,
    the trial judge gave his ruling on qualified privilege. He referred to it
    as such and began by setting out the traditional common law test for determining
    whether the publication was made on an occasion of qualified privilege: was
    the publication made fairly in furtherance of a legal, social or moral duty
    and communicated to persons who have an interest in receiving it? He noted
    that “[s]pecial circumstances must exist for qualified privilege to apply…because
    the law has recognized that in certain circumstances there exists a need
    in the public interest for a particular recipient to receive a frank and
    uninhibited account of certain information.” <i></i></p>

    decided that qualified privilege can attach to a communication by the media
    to the world at large provided it is published in a context of social or
    moral duty to report on the issues.” He continued that to determine public
    interest one takes account of the ten <i>Reynolds</i> factors, which he listed,

    found the tone of the article to be accusatory of the plaintiffs and favoured
    the cottagers’ views. He noted that the article set a negative tone about
    the plaintiff by beginning with his political contributions and power, and
    then indicating that he wanted something from the government. With respect
    to the timing of the publication on the day of the public meeting, he concluded
    that it was probably meant to impact on the purchase of the Crown lands,

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    fairness to the trial judge, he made this ruling at a time when the new defence
    was just developing in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">England</st1:country-region>
    and was not yet adopted as law in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario. In that context, the trial judge improperly tried to combine the
    two defences of qualified privilege and responsible journalism, rather than
    treat the new defence as a separate evaluation where the emphasis is on allowing
    more free and open reports on matters of public interest, as long as the
    reports are researched and published in a fair and responsible manner.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    are three areas in particular where the trial judge’s analysis fails to properly
    consider the test for public interest responsible journalism. The first is
    on the issue of the public interest. The trial judge’s finding was that the
    public interest was limited to the local residents and did not extend to
    the full readership of the Toronto Star. He did this by using the test for
    public interest for qualified privilege which focuses on the limitations
    on the category of those who have an interest in receiving information on
    an issue.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect, the trial judge applied the wrong test. As Lord Hoffman indicated
    in <i>Jameel</i>, the public interest test for responsible journalism is
    not whether the subject matter is one in which the public is interested but
    whether the subject of the article is, as a matter of law, a public matter.
    In contrast to his finding on the qualified privilege ruling, the trial judge
    correctly instructed the jury in his charge on the defence of fair comment
    on a matter of public interest, that the story was on a matter of public
    interest. Although I agree that the story would be of personal interest to
    those who live in the Twin Lakes area and who know or know of Mr. Grant and
    GFP Inc., it is also on a matter of public interest generally because it
    deals, as the trial judge correctly said, both with the private acquisition
    of Crown lands by a person who had made large political contributions to
    the governing political party, as well as with cottagers’
    environmental concerns. The trial judge should have first found that the
    story was on a matter of public interest, and then turned to the <i>Reynolds</i> factors
    for the purpose of assessing whether the story, including the impugned statements,
    was researched and verified in a responsible and fair manner.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second error was in the trial judge’s consideration of whether Mr. Schiller
    acted in a responsible and fair manner in the steps he took to research and
    verify the story. The trial judge acknowledged that Mr. Schiller “did take
    steps to verify some information.” However, he found that Mr. Schiller “made
    no effort” to verify whether Mr. Grant actually did have a lot of influence
    and whether the project “was a done deal because of his Mike Harris ties.” He
    based this finding on the evidence that Mr. Schiller did not put that question
    to the MNR officials and made no inquiries of government officials. <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    this analysis overlooks several relevant facts disclosed in the evidence.
    First, at the public meeting in January, one of the local residents questioned
    MNR officials as to whether the decision would be made in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    North Bay or at Queen’s Park. MNR officials indicated that they could not “speak
    to what happens at Queen’s Park” but assured local residents that they had
    done their job properly on the Osprey Links development. This exchange was
    reported in the story. Second, Mr. Schiller conducted extensive research
    for the article, obtaining documents from many sources and conducting numerous
    interviews. Third, he tried to interview Mr. Grant and Mr. Fleet but was
    totally rebuffed. He put questions in writing, as requested by Mr. Grant,
    but was told by Mr. Grant’s lawyer in response that he would not answer any
    of the questions. Although there was no specific question asking whether
    the approval was a “done deal,”
    there were questions about Mr. Grant’s political contributions to the Progressive
    Conservative Party and whether he had entertained Mike Harris at his home.
    It was incumbent on the trial judge to consider this evidence when assessing
    what more Mr.&nbsp;Schiller could and should have done to try to verify how
    influential Mr. Grant was politically and whether his influence had or would
    affect the approval decision. <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Grant’s refusal to respond to Mr. Schiller was also relevant to the trial
    judge’s analysis of whether the article contained the gist of the plaintiff’s
    side of the story. So too, on the other side, was the fact that Mr. Schiller
    did not include in the story the portion of Lorrie Clark’s e-mail admitting
    that the cottagers could be wrong in assuming that Mr. Grant was using political
    influence to get his project approved. There was also Mr. Schiller’s explanation
    for why he left out that comment . The trial judge should have weighed and
    balanced these aspects of the evidence when considering the important <i>Reynolds</i> factor
    of whether the article contained the gist of the plaintiff’s side of the
    story.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    conclude on this issue, the trial judge erred by not considering public interest
    responsible journalism as a separate defence from the defence of qualified
    privilege. By conflating the two defences, he wrongly concluded that the
    subject matter of the article was not of general public interest. He further
    erred in his application of the relevant <i>Reynolds</i> factors by failing
    to first have the jury determine the meaning of the impugned language. The
    extent of the sting of the libel will inform the application of the <i>Reynolds</i> factors
    to the issue of responsible journalism. The trial judge also failed to consider
    the full scope of the evidence in determining whether the defendants acted
    responsibly and fairly in researching, verifying and publishing the article.
    It was incumbent on the trial judge to apply the relevant factors in a way
    that sought to favour publication if the article was researched and published
    responsibly.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the defence of responsible journalism is a question of law for the judge
    to decide, in some cases the Court of Appeal will be able to apply the appropriate
    factors and substitute its own decision for that of the trial judge. However,
    for the reasons discussed above, the defence of responsible journalism cannot
    be properly evaluated in this case without regard to the meaning of the statements.
    That is a question that must be answered by a jury before Mr. Schiller’s
    actions in researching, verifying and publishing the article could be properly
    evaluated in accordance with the <i>Reynolds</i> factors. </p>

    “Could any <u>fair-minded</u> man honestly express that opinion on the proved

    standard such as fair-mindedness should not be included as an element of
    the test because what is considered fair-minded is inherently subjective.
    In the context of the fair comment defence, even stubborn or unreasonable
    people are entitled to state their honestly held views if their views are
    based on true facts (para. 28):</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Trenchant criticism
    which otherwise meets the “honest belief” criterion ought not to be actionable
    because, in the opinion of a court, it crosses some ill-defined line of “fair-mindedness.” The

    who explained at para. 3 that: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The protection
    from actionability which the common law gives to fair and honest comment
    on matters of public interest is an important aspect of freedom of speech.
    In this context, “fair” does not mean objectively reasonable. The defence
    protects obstinate, or foolish, or offensive statements of opinion, or inference,
    or judgment, provided certain conditions are satisfied. <u>The word “fair” refers

    Dickson J. had rejected the concept that the belief had to be fair in the
    sense of reasonable, rather than just honestly held. On the facts in <i>WIC</i>,
    Binnie J. found that the proper question was not necessarily what Raif Mair
    honestly believed but “whether the defamatory imputation that Kari Simpson ‘would
    condone violence toward gay people’ is an opinion that could be held by an
    honest person in the circumstances” (para. 61). </p>

    his charge to the jury in this case, the trial judge first explained that
    the defendants had to prove that the words complained of were recognizable
    by an ordinary reader as comment or opinion. The defendants object that the
    trial judge should have ruled that the impugned statement was a comment and
    not left that issue for the jury. In my view, although that is open to a
    trial judge, he made no error in explaining the test to the jury and leaving
    that issue, which was highly contested in the action, to the jury for its
    decision.</p>

    next told the jury that the article must be based on true facts set out or
    clearly indicated in the article and that it must be on a matter of public
    interest. As to component (d) of the test, as outlined by Binnie J. in <i>WIC</i>,
    the trial judge then explained that the defendant had to establish that the
    comment was one
    “which a person could honestly make on the facts proved.” He then said: “The
    comments must at least be fair in the sense that a fair-minded person could
    believe the comment. The comments must satisfy the following objective tests:
    Could any fair-minded person honestly express that opinion on a proved fact?”
    He went on to the final component of the test, telling the jury that the
    defence will fail if the plaintiff proves on the balance of probabilities
    that the defendant was actuated by express malice.</p>

line-height:normal'>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge then discussed the impugned statements in the context of whether
    they were statements of fact or comment and told them that as a matter of
    law, this was a matter of public interest. On the issue of the objective
    honest belief test, he accurately repeated it twice, asking the jury whether
    the comment was one “which a person could honestly make on the facts proved?” However,
    he then repeated four further times the erroneous concepts of “fairness and
    fair-mindedness”. He said to the jury, “So ask yourselves a question: Could
    a fair-minded person honestly express that opinion? The comment must be fair
    in the sense that a fair-minded person would believe it. So was it a comment?
    Could a fair-minded person express that comment?” He then added at that point
    that “a statement of fact cannot be a comment for the purpose of fair comment
    if it is a new and independent fact. The plaintiffs submit that the statement ‘Everyone
    thinks it’s a done deal’ is a new and independent fact, and therefore ought
    not to be treated as comment.”</p>

line-height:normal'>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the trial judge properly charged the jury on s. 24 of the <i>Libel and Slander
    Act </i>as follows<i>:</i></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>There’s also
    s. 24 of the <i>Libel and Slander Act</i> that says, </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Where a
    defendant published defamatory matter that is an opinion expressed by another
    person, a defence of fair comment by the defendant shall not fail for the
    reason only that the defendant or the person who expressed the opinion or
    both, did not hold the opinion, if a person could honestly hold that opinion.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>So in this case,
    Mr. Schiller relied on an opinion from Lorrie Clark when he wrote, “Everyone
    thinks it’s a done deal because of Grant’s influence but most of all his
    Mike Harris ties.” If you find that the quote is comment and not a statement
    of fact, s. 24 provides that the defence of fair comment will not fail only
    because one or both did not hold the opinion stated, provided a person could
    honestly hold that opinion.</p>

    set out the trial judge’s instructions on this issue in detail to show that
    although he properly set out the honest belief test in his first description
    to the jury and in the s. 24 instruction, he repeated many times the concept
    that when applying the test, jury members were to consider what a “fair-minded” person
    would believe. In my view this was an error that may have affected the jury’s
    verdicts. </p>

line-height:normal'>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the issue of malice, the plaintiffs presented the defendants as having acted
    unfairly toward Mr. Grant and as having been motivated by malice in the way
    they approached the story and its publication. On the basis of the very large
    punitive damages award, it appears that the jury accepted this characterization
    of the defendants’ behaviour. </p>

    the jury’s apparent finding that the defendants were actuated by malice,
    it is arguable that the verdict was not impacted by the trial judge’s error
    in formulating the honest belief component of the fair comment test. However,
    reading the charge as a whole, one cannot say that this error, in combination
    with other errors that I will discuss below, did not contribute to the overall
    view reached by the jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
    this case involved a media report relaying cottagers’
    concerns about a proposed development, some confusion arose when the judge
    charged the jury on the role of honest belief when considering the issue
    of malice. When explaining the concept of malice in the context of fair comment,
    the trial judge informed the jury members that malice could not be found
    if they decided that the writer honestly believed the statement. Although
    he informed the jury of the application of s. 24 of the <i>Libel and Slander
    Act</i>, which provides that a writer may still be protected by the fair
    comment defence even where he or she may not honestly believe what is being
    reported as long as it could honestly be believed, he did not explain to
    the jury how this proposition could impact the question of honest belief
    as it related to the determination of malice. <i></i></p>

line-height:normal'>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge reinforced this potential confusion later in the malice charge
    after he instructed the jury, properly, that to find malice the dominant
    purpose must be to injure the plaintiff. He then told them: <i></i></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>You must start
    by presuming the good faith and honest belief of the defendant in the truth
    of the statement.… Juries should be very slow to draw the inference that
    a defendant was so far actuated by improper motives as to deprive him of
    the protection of fair comment, unless they are satisfied that he did not
    believe what he said or wrote was true or that he was indifferent to its
    truth or falsity. The test of honest belief is subjective not objective.
    This means that the belief does not have to be reached on reasonable grounds.
    The test is whether the defendant honestly believed the words to be true
    and if you so find, there is no malice.    <i></i></p>

line-height:normal'>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Of
    course in this case, the defendants were reporting the concern expressed
    by Lorrie Clark and the cottagers and setting out the background for their
    concerns. Focusing on Mr. Schiller’s honest belief in the truth of the statement
    to determine malice was misleading and potentially confusing to the jury
    in the context of this article. It was correct to charge the jury that intrinsic
    evidence, such as the use of language in the article that was excessive,
    disproportionate to the facts or containing gross irrelevancies, could be
    used to infer malice. It is also correct that if the jury believed that by
    embellishing the factual record to support the cottagers’
    concerns, the defendants had adopted the comment as their own, then their
    lack of honest belief could be relevant to malice, but not otherwise. The
    trial judge’s failure to explain this was confusing and an error in the context
    of this charge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his charge on malice, the trial judge referred to the ten reasons that plaintiffs’ counsel
    had told the jury should make them find malice. Although he did not restate
    those reasons to the jury, the trial judge did not balance plaintiffs’ counsel’s
    submissions by referring to any of defendants’
    counsel’s submissions on the evidence that the defendants said showed that
    they were not actuated by malice. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Also,
    the first of the ten reasons for finding malice that plaintiffs’ counsel
    had put to the jury was that Mr. Schiller did not honestly believe that Peter
    Grant had used political influence to affect the approval process. Again,
    Mr. Schiller’s personal belief was not relevant if the purpose and effect
    of the story was to report the opinion of others. It could only be relevant
    if he was adopting the comment as his own view.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    other important issue that arises out of this part of the charge relates
    to the intended meaning of the defamatory words. Mr. Schiller had explained
    that he did not believe the article said or meant that Mr. Grant had used
    direct political pressure. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    relevance of what the publisher of the defamatory statement subjectively
    meant and honestly believed arose in the Supreme Court’s consideration of
    the defence of fair comment in the <i>WIC </i>decision. In that case, Mr.
    Mair contended that his words had not suggested that Ms. Simpson advocated
    violence against gay people, nor did he honestly believe that she did. The
    issue was whether he could rely on the defence of fair comment if the words
    did have that meaning, when he had no honest belief in the statement if it
    had that meaning. Binnie J. disposed of the issue in favour of Mr. Mair,
    stating: “It seems to me that defamation proceedings will have reached a
    troubling level of technicality if the protection afforded by the defence
    of fair comment to freedom of expression (“the very lifeblood of our freedom”)
    is made to depend on whether or not the speaker is prepared to swear to an
    honest belief in something he does not believe he ever said” (para. 35).  However,
    as Lord Nicholls of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Birkenhead pointed out in <i>Bonnick</i>, if the unintended meaning is a
    clear one that others would understand from the impugned words, the publisher
    of those words may not be able to avoid responsibility for the unintended
    meaning.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge did not clarify at any stage that since Mr. Schiller was the
    conduit for the comment and not its maker, the fact that he did not honestly
    believe it could not be used as a foundation for finding malice unless in
    the context of the article, he had adopted the comment as his own. However,
    other evidence intrinsic to the article, such as the choice of language and
    the context in which it was used, could be used to infer malice on the part
    of Mr. Schiller. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Of
    course, malice can only defeat the defence of fair comment if malice was
    shown to have been the dominant purpose for writing the article.  Although
    the trial judge did mention this requirement in the course of his instruction
    on malice, he did not make it clear to the jury that even if they found some
    of the elements that could be construed as malice, if the defence of fair
    comment otherwise applied, malice would only defeat the defence if it was
    the dominant purpose of the defamatory article.</p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'>Issue 3: Other Errors in the Charge</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defendants submit that the trial judge erred by failing to fairly summarize
    the evidence in his charge. Although he reviewed the evidence of each witness
    in examination in chief and in cross-examination, he did not review the cross-examination
    of the plaintiffs’ witness, Mr. Webster, the employee whom Mr. Grant sent
    to detain the Star photographer, Mr. Slaughter, until the police arrived
    and who used his car to try to prevent Mr. Slaughter from leaving the area.
    The trial judge reviewed Mr. Webster’s evidence in chief but did not mention
    his cross-examination in which he acknowledged several important details:
    (1) that Mr. Grant told him to try to block Mr. Slaughter from leaving the
    area, (2) that he did not move over to the side of the road to let Mr. Slaughter
    pass, causing him to narrowly miss the ditch, and (3) that he did not see
    Mr. Slaughter on the golf course but saw him standing by the side of the
    public road on the swale taking pictures. This evidence was important to
    the defendants in the context of the second aspect of the libel claim relating
    to how this incident was conveyed in the article.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Defendants’ counsel
    asked the judge to correct this in a recharge but he declined to do so. Although
    this was not a fatal error, it is important that a trial judge fairly summarize
    the evidence, especially the evidence on significant issues in the action. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defendants submit that the trial judge erred in his instruction to the jury
    regarding defamatory meaning. He told the jury that he had decided as a matter
    of law, that the words complained of were capable of having a libellous meaning
    and it was now for them to decide whether the words actually libelled the
    plaintiff. He went on to say: “The result of my decision that the words are
    capable of a libellous meaning is that the words complained of are, in law,
    presumed to be false. The plaintiff does not have to prove they are false
    because they are presumed to be false.”</p>

line-height:normal'>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the course of considering this submission, it came to my attention that this
    part of the charge, as well as several other aspects of the charge that included
    examples used by the trial judge to illustrate legal concepts, came from
    a standard form of charge used by trial judges in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario. This instruction, as well as the examples, appear to have been included
    in the standard form for several decades, which explains why the trial judge
    relied on them. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    this instruction is in error and misleading to the jury. It is the jury’s
    role to determine whether the words complained of are defamatory. It is only
    once they decide that the words are defamatory that the words are presumed
    to be untrue and the plaintiff is presumed to have suffered damage from their
    publication. If the defendant wishes to justify the words, the defendant
    must prove they are true. The presumption of falsity does not arise from
    the ruling of the trial judge that the words are capable of being defamatory.
    That ruling is simply the result of the exercise of the gatekeeper function
    before the trial judge may leave the issue of whether the words are defamatory
    to the jury. The ruling has no other legal consequence. Telling the jury
    that the presumption of falsity arose from that ruling before they had decided
    if the words were defamatory may have given them a negative impression about
    the words and about the defendants’ use of the words, before the jury began
    their job.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Eady
    J., a very experienced libel judge in the High Court of Justice in England,
    gave the following instruction on the presumption of falsity in <i>Jameel </i>(cited
    by the Court of Appeal in its judgment at para. 41), which makes it clear
    that the presumption of falsity arises only if the jury decides that the
    words are defamatory:<i></i></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Before I come
    to the evidence on these issues, which you have to consider, can I just say
    one or two more things about the general shape of this case. First, if you
    decide that it is defamatory of one or both claimants, we must all proceed
    on the basis that any such defamatory allegation is untrue. We take that
    as a given.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the better practice is for trial judges not to tell juries about
    rulings they have made, unless it is necessary either to instruct them to
    follow a particular ruling or to tell them that a conclusion is unavailable
    because of a legal ruling. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly,
    examples used to illustrate points of law are best taken from the evidence
    itself, as this is very helpful to juries in understanding a point. Examples
    can be helpful when they are neutral in the context of the case, such as
    when trial judges explain the concept of circumstantial evidence by saying
    that a person who wakes up in the morning and sees it is wet outside may
    infer that it rained overnight. The standard libel charge, however, includes
    the example of Mr. X, a city’s treasurer who overspent his budget and who
    became the subject of an article reporting that he had “liberated public
    money”. The trial judge referred to this example several times in his charge
    to illustrate concepts of meaning. In my view, this is not a neutral example,
    but is clearly defamatory, suggesting that Mr. X stole the money. It can
    be diverting and unhelpful for the jury to have to focus on new fact situations
    when they are trying to understand and apply difficult and nuanced concepts
    in libel to the evidence they have heard.   </p>

line-height:normal'>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defendants object to the decision of the trial judge to allow the plaintiffs
    to lead evidence and claim damages based on the allegation that the article
    caused the MNR to delay the approval of the golf course project. This issue
    was not pleaded but was raised just before trial. This was clearly a discretionary
    decision made by the trial judge on a matter of procedure that is to be accorded
    deference. I agree with the defendants, however, that the evidence on this
    issue was speculative at best and no evidence was called from the MNR, the
    only people with real knowledge on the issue. It would therefore have been
    preferable for the trial judge to explain this to the jury when leaving this
    aspect of damage with them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defendants raise several objections to the charge on the issue of damages.
    The trial judge’s discussion of damages was brief. He was entitled to conclude
    that aggravated and punitive damages could be available depending on the
    jury’s view of the evidence and the meaning of the article, and to instruct
    them accordingly. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defendants also ask the court to reduce the amount of the compensatory damage
    awards and to vacate the punitive damage award. Because I would order a new
    trial based on the errors already identified, it is unnecessary to further
    address these issues.</p>

    the public interest responsible journalism defence is a question of law for

    in applying the test, the Court of Appeal will be able to apply the appropriate
    factors and substitute its decision for that of the trial judge. However,
    in this case, for the reasons I have discussed above including the need for
    the jury to decide the meaning of the impugned statements for the purpose
    of assessing the defence, as well as because other errors in the charge may
    well have affected the jury’s verdict, the proper remedy in this case is
    a new trial where all of the issues will be decided.</p>
