  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
      appellant was charged with possession of crack cocaine for the purpose
      of trafficking, possession of the proceeds of crime and possession of stolen
      property valued at less than $5,000. The appellant offered to plead guilty
      to simple possession of cocaine but that proposed plea was rejected by
      the Crown. Following a trial before Frazer J., the appellant was convicted
      on all counts and sentenced to a total of 15 months imprisonment. The appellant
      appeals her convictions and seeks leave to appeal sentence. </a></p>
  <p><b><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant was initially arrested as the result of police surveillance on
    January 17, 2005. A passenger in the appellant's car got out of the car,
    was followed into a liquor store and was observed stealing four bottles of
    liquor. Both the passenger and the appellant were arrested after the passenger
    returned to the appellant's car and placed the liquor bottles, which were
    not in a bag, in the back seat. On searching the car and conducting an initial
    search of the appellant's person, police found a .7 gram piece of crack cocaine
    on the floor of the passenger side of the car, four bundles of cash totalling
    $1750 in the appellant's coat pocket and $230 in her wallet.<span style='font-size:

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Once
    at the police station, the appellant was searched again. Police found two
    more pieces of crack cocaine, weighing a total of 22.2 grams, secreted in
    the appellant's wig.<span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    trial, the appellant claimed that she did not know that the passenger stole
    the liquor. She also claimed that the passenger handed her the cocaine because
    he was afraid of being arrested when the police stopped them. The appellant
    explained that she and the passenger had previously had a fling and that
    she just put the cocaine in her wig not knowing what else to do with it.
    The appellant also explained that her sister gave her $2000 on January 17,
    2005 to pay bills and that she spent $20 on phone cards that day. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>During
    her examination-in-chief, the appellant's counsel asked her why she did not
    tell the officer who searched her that she had the drugs. The appellant responded
    that she did not think the police would believe her.<span style='font-size:
14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> The
    appellant's sister also testified at trial and produced a bank transaction
    record confirming a $2000 withdrawal.<span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    rejecting the appellant's explanation for possessing the cocaine, the trial
    judge said, among other things, the following:<span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>At the time of her arrest, Ms. Palmer attempted
    to physically dissuade Constable Wyrzykowska from searching her wig. Those
    actions may be seen as consistent with her explanation that she was simply
    hiding these drugs for [the passenger] having been handed them in a frantic
    moment of panic and placing them under her wig. Her actions in attempting
    to dissuade Constable Wyrzykowksa may be consistent with that explanation.
    But having chosen to speak to Constable Wyrzykowksa and Constable Wyrzykowska
    refers to a conversation with the accused in her evidence during the course
    of this search, there was no reference made to the explanation of her possession
    now offered by her in her evidence in this trial. If her explanation as to
    her possession was so simple and obvious to give, in her first opportunity
    to do so, she failed to offer it.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This is not a case of the Court being critical
    of someone not speaking. That of course is their inalienable right not to
    speak to police, but having chosen to do so, she failed to avail herself
    of the opportunity to offer an explanation which she now advances was so
    simple and obvious to give.<span style='font-size:14.0pt'>&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my view, that failure to do so serves to diminish
    any weight to be given to her explanation now offered and her explanation
    is rejected based on these reasons.<span> Having rejected her evidence, neither
    am I left in any doubt by it when considered together with the evidence as
    a whole.</span></p>
  <p><b><span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>Conviction Appeal</span></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant raised two issues on her conviction appeal, but in oral argument
    acknowledged that the second ground would not constitute a free-standing
    ground of appeal. The appellant's main ground of appeal is that trial judge's
    reasons for rejecting her innocent explanation for possession of the drugs
    infringed her right to silence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    agree. Although the Crown argues, in effect, that defence counsel's (not
    Mr. Snell) examination-in-chief amounted to an implicit waiver of the appellant's
    right to silence, we cannot accept that submission. Defence counsel's examination
    did no more than invite an explanation from the appellant about why she did
    not advance an explanation to the police. It was open to the trial judge
    to reject the appellants explanation given at trial because it was not believable
    and to use that finding in assessing the appellants overall credibility.
    However, the trial judge went further and used the appellant's silence as
    a basis for finding her incredible. That he was not entitled to do. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown, very fairly, does not contend that the proviso should be applied in
    these circumstances. The appeal is therefore allowed, the convictions are
    set aside and a new trial is ordered. </p>
