  <h4><span lang=EN-US>INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW OF THE CASE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the second time in three years Miguna Miguna’s statement of claim has come
    to this Court entirely – or, in this case, almost entirely – struck down.  In
    the action he claims damages against the prosecution and police defendants
    for conduct arising out of his arrest, trial and acquittal on three charges
    of sexual assault.  Although the action was commenced in July, 2004, no statements
    of defence have yet been delivered.  I have concluded that it is time they
    were.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    facts are summarized in <i>Miguna v.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario (Attorney General)</i> (2005), 262 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 222 (“<i>Miguna
    No. 1</i>”).  I repeat them here.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Miguna
    Miguna is a barrister and solicitor, practising in the areas of human rights
    law and immigration and refugee law, amongst others.  He was born in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Kenya</st1:country-region>
    , subsequently immigrated to
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    and became a Canadian citizen.  He was called to the Ontario Bar in 1995. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    November 4, 2002, he was arrested at his law offices and charged with sexual
    assault following a complaint from one of his immigration clients.  On July
    14, 2003, when he appeared in court for the commencement of his trial on
    that charge, he was arrested again and charged with three further counts
    of sexual assault arising out of the complaints of another immigration client.  Both
    arrests took place in front of colleagues and the public.  He alleges that
    he was arrested, searched, handcuffed and detained in full public view at
    the court house on July 14 notwithstanding that he had, four days earlier,
    attended voluntarily at the police station, with his lawyer, in response
    to a police query to his staff about his whereabouts during an absence from
    his office while he was in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Kenya</st1:country-region>
    .</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    June 23, 2004, he was acquitted of all charges by Moore J. of the Ontario
    Court of Justice.  The trial judge accepted his evidence, found that there
    were contradictions in the testimony of the two complainants and was suspicious
    that they had a common motive to implicate Mr. Miguna.  Moore J. concluded
    that the police investigation of the case was wanting in some respects.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Miguna commenced two proceedings against the Crown, the police, Her Majesty
    the Queen in right of Ontario, the Attorney General for Ontario and Legal
    Aid Ontario, alleging malicious prosecution (including a serious allegation
    of racial profiling), breach of his <i>Charter</i> rights, negligent investigation
    and assault on the part of the police, and a galaxy of other “causes of action”,
    some of which existed in law and some of which do not.  The defendants moved
    to strike the claims and succeeded before Paisley J.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    Court set aside the order of Paisley J. on December 14, 2005 – except for
    the portion of the order dismissing the action against the Attorney General
    for
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario and Legal Aid
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario
    – and permitted Mr. Miguna to deliver an amended statement of claim.  The
    Court observed that the claim as then drafted was unfocused, overextended
    (in the sense of the 16-25 causes of action it purported to raise), replete
    with pejorative adverbs and adjectives superimposed one on the other as a
    substitute for pleading facts, and lacking in material facts to support the
    sweeping allegations made.  Nevertheless, it should not have been struck
    since, at its core, it pleaded facts that could support a number of causes
    of action against the defendants. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Miguna responded by delivering a fresh statement of claim on January 11,
    2006 and – following a further demand for particulars by the defendants – an
    88-page, 215-paragraph amended fresh statement of claim.  In the new claim,
    he has limited his causes of action to malicious prosecution, <i>Charter</i> breaches
    (ss. 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, and 15), misfeasance and malfeasance in public office
    (abuse of process power in public office), negligent investigation (against
    the Police Defendants<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><sup><sup><span style='font-size:13.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;'>[1]</span></sup></sup></a> only),
    assault and battery, false arrest, false imprisonment, gross negligence or
    negligence as against Chief Fantino only, intentional infliction of emotional
    and physical distress, excessive use of force and loss of income.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    fresh amended statement of claim was in turn attacked by the Police Defendants<sup>,</sup> the
    Crown Defendants<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><sup><sup><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></sup></sup></a>, Chief Fantino and the Toronto Police Services Board.  Justice
    Spence struck most of the pleading in his order of February 14, 2007.  Mr.
    Miguna now appeals from that order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, I would again allow his appeal and – with some exceptions
    outlined below – permit his action to proceed. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defendants sought to have the fresh amended statement of claim struck and
    the action dismissed against them pursuant to rule 21.01, on the basis that
    the claim discloses no cause of action or, alternatively, is frivolous and
    vexatious.  In the further alternative, they asked to have numerous portions
    of the claim struck under rule 25.11, which empowers the court to strike
    all or part of a pleading that (a) may prejudice or delay the fair trial
    of the action, (b) is scandalous, frivolous or vexatious, or (c) is an abuse
    of the process of the court.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown Defendants contended that paras. 7, 15-17, 23, 27, 104-106, 109-143,
    145-147, 149-154, 156-168, 192-198, 201-203 and 205 of the claim continue
    to constitute the improper pleading of bald allegations as against them;
    that paras. 16, 27, 104, 110-111, 118, 161, 165, and 195 constituted an impermissible
    pleading of negligence against the Crown; that paras. 28-34 were vexatious,
    scandalous, frivolous allegations and allegations inserted for colour or
    argument; and that paras. 23-24 misrepresented court proceedings and were
    therefore an abuse of process.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    their part, the Police Defendants distilled their attack on the adequacy
    of the pleading into the following submission:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The fourth Statement of Claim still fails to comply
    with the <i>Rules</i> respecting pleadings, fails to plead sufficient facts
    and particulars to support the allegations made, does not clarify which cause(s)
    of action the facts pleaded are related to, pleads vague, speculative and
    inflammatory allegations, pleads allegations that are irrelevant, improper
    and embarrassing, includes argument and is replete with repetition.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Not
    to be outdone, Mr. Miguna had responded to earlier correspondence from the
    defendants more or less setting out the foregoing complaints in a letter
    dated 16 February 2006 (an exhibit to the defendants’
    materials) with his own volley:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Let us also agree that this is my statement of
    claim, not your respective clients’.  There is absolutely no way that I can
    prepare a claim that the defendants approve of.  To expect such a thing is
    not just unreasonable; it is also naïve. …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:
center'>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I would also like to state here categorically that
    I will not reorganize the Claim by grouping the causes of actions and listing
    the facts below each and every different cause of action as you are suggesting.  First,
    you cannot purport to be drafting the claim for me.  Second, the facts in
    support of all the causes of action are interwoven and intertwined.  It would
    be virtually impossible for me to do what you are asking for.  What you have,
    and will have in the Amended Fresh Statement of claim, are more than adequate
    facts in support of the claim.  You may choose to characterize it in any
    negative manner you wish.  However, this mischaracterization will not change
    those facts.  Frankly, I have never pleaded more facts in my eleven years
    of practice than in this claim. ..</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It is quite frustrating to see that all the defendants
    are more interested in pursuing a fight rather than in trying to move this
    matter along.  I can assure everyone involved that I am not going to be legally
    bludgeoned to death in this case.  I shall persist until the whole truth
    comes out and justice is done.</p>
  
  
  
  
  <h3>Errors in Principle</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this cross-fire of assertions, I am persuaded that Mr. Miguna has the better
    of the argument.  I do not consider the fresh amended statement of claim – far
    from perfect as it remains – to be as flawed as the defendants contend or
    the motion judge concluded. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge committed three errors in principle in his approach to the analysis
    of the problem before him, in my respectful view.  First, he struck out claims
    that this Court had already ruled the plaintiff was entitled to pursue.  Secondly,
    and most significantly, he arrived at his decision by, in effect, trying
    the case – or, at least, dealing with the motion as if it were a motion for
    summary judgment – based on a meticulous analysis and weighing of the allegations
    in the pleading amongst themselves and compared with certain external evidence
    that he had.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><sup><sup><span style='font-size:13.0pt;
font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;'>[3]</span></sup></sup></a>  This
    is not the function of a judge when dealing with a pleadings motion such
    as this.  Thirdly, he applied a test that was too narrow in relation to the
    central issue of malice.  These errors permeate the motion judge’s reasoning.</p>
  <h3><i><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>Miguna No. 1</span></u></i><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>:
        Claims Miguna is Entitled to Pursue</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    fresh amended statement of claim continues to contain the core allegations
    that were outlined in this Court’s earlier decision.  The Court has already
    ruled that those allegations, if proved, <i>could</i> support the causes
    of action still being asserted.  In <i>Miguna No. 1</i>, at paras. 16-17,
    the Court stated:</p>
  <p align=left class="DoubleIndentQuote" style='text-align:left;'>[16]<span style='font-size:7.0pt;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    said that, however, the statement of claim does contain some basis for alleging
    the core causes of action that are asserted, and in my view, Mr. Miguna should
    be given an opportunity to amend to make out his case properly on a pleading
    basis.  For instance, he alleges that:</p>
  <p align=left class="DoubleIndentQuote" style='text-align:left;'>a)<span style='font-size:7.0pt;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>he
    was arrested without reasonable cause and without the police having conducted
    a proper investigation on both November 4, 2002 (at his law office) and July
    14, 2003 (at the courthouse);</p>
  <p align=left class="DoubleIndentQuote" style='text-align:left;'>b)<span style='font-size:7.0pt;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>both
    arrests were made publicly with a view to embarrassing and humiliating him

    administration and the public;</p>
  <p align=left class="DoubleIndentQuote" style='text-align:left;'>c)<span style='font-size:7.0pt;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    July 14 arrest was carried out in full public view, and on the instructions
    of the Crown, notwithstanding that Mr. Miguna and his lawyer had only four

    that the police had been looking for him;</p>

    and (iii) he found Mr. Miguna to be a credible witness; in addition, the
    trial judge also alluded to the fact that Mr. Miguna was arrested on July
    14, 2003, “despite offers by Mr. Miguna and his counsel to present himself
    to the police prior to that date”;</p>

    facts and evidence to the Ontario Court of Justice, interfered with witnesses,

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[17]<span style='font-size:7.0pt;'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    are very serious allegations, and are, of course, only allegations at this
    stage of the proceedings.  Mr. Miguna fails to establish them at his peril
    in terms of costs and, possibly, his reputation.  For the most part, the
    allegations are pleaded in an unacceptably bald fashion.  However, if appropriately
    supported by material facts, and proven, they
    – and other facts pleaded – <i>could</i> support claims for malicious prosecution,
    breach of the <i>Charter</i> and misfeasance in public office as against
    the Crown Attorney and Police defendants, and as against the Police defendants
    alone claims for negligent investigation, unlawful arrest, false imprisonment,
    and assault and battery.  In my view, the plaintiff should be entitled to
    one more chance to attempt to plead these claims properly.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    foregoing allegations remain the centrepiece of Mr. Miguna’s claim.  What
    he has done in his amended pleading, however, is to endeavour to provide
    the particulars of those allegations that he was previously criticized for
    omitting and that the defendants continued to demand.  As the motion judge
    noted, “the Plaintiff has pleaded a very considerable amount of additional
    material.”  It seems ironic that the causes of action which this Court had
    already ruled could be supported by the core facts initially pleaded should
    be struck completely when the pleading has been amended to provide further
    particulars.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    principles to be applied on a motion of this nature were summarized in <i>Miguna
    No. 1</i>, at para. 9:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>On a motion to strike a pleading pursuant to Rule
    21 of the Rules of Civil Procedure the facts as pleaded in the statement
    of claim must be taken to be true, although allegations of assumptions and
    speculation need not be accepted as such: see <i>Operation Dismantle v. The
    Queen</i>, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 441 at 455.  Where malice is alleged, full particulars
    must be provided : Rule 25.06(8).  For a claim to be struck, it must be “plain
    and obvious” that no cause of action is disclosed: <i>Hunt v. Carey</i>,
    [1990] 2 S.C.R. 959.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    it is sought to strike out a claim on the basis that it is frivolous or vexatious
    or an abuse of the process of the court, the court will only do so in the
    clearest of cases where it is plain and obvious that the case cannot succeed: <i>Nelles
    v. Ontario</i>, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 170 at para 3; <i>Temilini v. Ontario Provincial
    Police Commissioner</i> (1990), 73 O.R. (2d) 664 (C.A.).  In <i>Temilini</i>,
    Grange J.A. put it this way at p. 668:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The plaintiff has pleaded all the essentials to
    establish his case.  It is true that he is woefully short of evidence to
    prove his case but that is not, and in my view should not be, the test.  The
    test, which has been articulated time and time again, and recently in <i>Nelles
    v. Ontario</i> [citations omitted], is that the rule should be exercised
    only in the clearest cases.  Where a case cannot succeed because the law
    forbids it, the rule brings a salutary end to the proceedings.  <i>In cases
    depending on the facts, however, the court should be very loath to determine
    those issues in a summary fashion.  When the case appears only to lack evidence,
    so long as the gaps may be filled, either by discovery or the revelation
    of evidence at trial, the case should be allowed to proceed.  Trials are
    notoriously unpredictable.</i>  Many a case apparently hopeless on the facts
    has been transformed into a winner by an unexpected turn of events in the
    form of either a surprise witness or a witness giving surprising evidence.
    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge recognized these principles.  At para. 11 of his reasons he
    said: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It is not disputed that on a motion to strike the
    test is whether it is plain and obvious on the facts pleaded that the claim
    of the plaintiff cannot succeed.  The facts relied on by the Plaintiff must
    be properly pleaded.  In applying the test, the Court is to assume that properly
    pleaded facts are true.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Respectfully,
    however, he did not apply those principles.  The error into which the motion
    judge fell is captured in the following observations of Carthy J.A. (McKinlay
    J.A., concurring) in <i>Prete v. Ontario</i> (1993), 16 O.R. (3d) 161 (

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It is now necessary to deal with the alternative
    argument of the respondents that the statement of claim should be struck
    under Rule 21 or Rule 25 of the Rules of Civil Procedure, R.R.O. 1990, Reg.
    194… [I]n my view, at this stage of the proceedings, the facts alleged in
    the statement of claim should be taken as true for the purpose of determining
    whether the claim discloses a reasonable cause of action.  <i>To do otherwise
    is to effectively conduct a summary judgment proceeding</i> under Rule 20
    without having the sworn evidence of the parties to this litigation as a

    from these comments that the court should, at the earliest stage of an action
    of this type, assess the reality of success and eliminate those cases that
    lack promise of success</i>.  In the present case, I have no hesitation in
    concluding that, on the basis of the entire record presented to us, the action
    is not likely to succeed.  In fact, there is nothing to indicate that it
    will succeed, except the allegations in the pleading.<i> But that is a very
    significant exception, and we should not depart from the rule that the pleadings
    must be taken as factually true simply because the allegations are serious
    and the case appears hopeless</i>. [Emphasis added]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    same error is reflected in the reasons of the motion judge.  At para. 19,
    he said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The Court should, at the earliest stage of a malicious
    prosecution action, assess the reality of success and eliminate those cases
    that lack any chance of success. … The Court [in <i>Nelles</i>] articulated
    the view that actions for malicious prosecution <i>should receive special
    judicial scrutiny</i> at an early stage and that the “rules of civil procedure
    should not act as obstacles to a just and expeditious resolution of a case.” [Emphasis
    added]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    then cited the oft-quoted passage from the reasons of Lamer J. in <i>Nelles</i>:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In his conclusion, Lamer J., at paragraph 56, underlined
    the importance of being able to strike meritless actions for malicious prosecution
    at an early stage:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>In my view the inherent difficulty in proving
    a case of malicious prosecution combined with the mechanisms available within
    the system of civil procedure to weed out meritless claims is sufficient
    to ensure that the Attorney General and Crown Attorneys will not be hindered
    in the proper execution of their important public duties.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Courts
    need to scrutinize claims of this nature carefully.  Like Carthy J.A. in <i>Prete</i>,
    however, I do not read Lamer J.’s comments as mandating an aggressive attempt
    by judges to weed out malicious prosecution actions at the early pleading
    stage by effectively turning motions to strike under Rules 21 and 25 into
    motions for summary judgment or a trial.  I read them as pointing out, simply,
    that the concerns about a possible chilling effect on the administration
    of justice if such actions are permitted to proceed are at least partly met
    by the fact that a procedure for striking out meritless claims exists.  Lamer
    J. was only reminding the profession of the existence of the procedure; he
    was not advocating that it be transformed into something else. </p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>The Motion Judge Applied Too Narrow
        a Test With Respect to Malice</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    existence of malice is a central component of a number of the causes of action
    asserted by Mr. Miguna in this action.  These include malicious prosecution,
    abuse of process (misfeasance or malfeasance in public office) and <i>Charter</i> breaches.  Lack
    of reasonable and probable cause – an element of malice – is also an element
    of the torts of negligent investigation, false arrest and false imprisonment,
    which are asserted against the Police Defendants.  Thus malice, and the pleading
    of facts designed to show malice on the part of the defendants – including
    lack of reasonable and probable cause – are important building blocks for
    Mr. Miguna’s claim and occupy large portions of the fresh amended statement
    of claim.  The claim must be read as a whole in this regard. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge’s analysis of malice is instructive, therefore, in understanding
    the error in his approach to the disposition of the motion.  He concluded
    first that, in deciding whether the allegations made by the plaintiff assert
    facts that would support a finding of malice,</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>a
    court is not to infer malice, in the absence of direct evidence of malice,
    unless that is the only reasonable inference to be drawn from the facts;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    question for the judge should be: is it plain and obvious that a trier of
    fact could not conclude that malice is the only reasonable inference to be
    drawn from those facts? </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motions judge then noted that the two elements of the tort of malicious prosecution
    at issue here are (a) whether the prosecution was commenced or continued
    without reasonable and probable cause, and (b) whether the prosecution was
    activated by malice.  He followed this observation with a thorough analysis
    of the law relating to the concepts of “reasonable and probable cause”
    and “malice”.  In relation to reasonable and probable cause, he determined
    that a plaintiff must demonstrate there is not even an arguable case to be
    presented by the prosecution to the Court for determination: <i>Scott v.
    Ontario</i>, [2002] O.J. No. 4111 (S.C.J.); aff’d [2003] O.J. No. 4407 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  In relation to malice, he accepted  (i) that malice, for these purposes,
    consists of the “deliberate and improper use of the office” in which the
    wrongdoer
    “perpetrate[s] a fraud on the process of criminal justice and in doing so
    pervert[s] or abuse[s] his office and the process of criminal justice”; (ii)
    that recklessness alone is not enough to establish malice; and (iii) that
    a plaintiff must show the actual motive was improper, or demonstrate that
    the prosecution can only be explained by imputing a wrong and indirect motive:
    see <i>Nelles</i>; <i>Proulx v. Quebec</i> <i>(Attorney General)</i>, [2001]
    3 S.C.R. 9, at para. 35. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge’s overview of the law with respect to malice is unobjectionable.  However,
    he fell into error in two ways in applying it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    his recognition of the high threshold that a plaintiff in such cases must
    meet led him to take an overly critical approach to the fresh amended statement
    of claim, as outlined above.  Pleadings are to be given a generous interpretation
    at this stage, even allowing for the careful scrutiny that a case of this
    nature calls for. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Secondly,
    his formulation of the test to be applied on the crucial question of malice
    was too narrow, in my opinion.  In asking whether it was plain and obvious
    that a trier of fact could not conclude that malice was the only reasonable
    inference to be drawn from those facts, the motion judge failed to apply
    the law as he had articulated it.  The principle is that, in the absence
    of direct evidence of malice, a court will not infer malice unless that is
    the only reasonable inference to be drawn from the facts.  The motion judge
    only applied the second branch of the principle, however.  Whether the evidence
    supporting the material facts pleaded in the claim is direct or circumstantial
    cannot be determined at this stage of the proceedings.  Indeed, whether malice
    is the only reasonable inference that can be drawn from the facts pleaded
    is not something that is readily determined at the pleading stage.  So much
    depends upon the testimony of the witnesses and the inferences and nuances
    to be drawn from that evidence.  The proper test to be applied is whether
    it is plain and obvious that the material facts as pleaded could not lead
    to a finding of malice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    error compounded the mistake embedded in the process of analysis in which
    the motion judge engaged to determine the overall issue before him.  Although
    acknowledging that he was required to accept the truth of the facts as pleaded
    for purposes of the request to strike the claims, he did not do so.  Instead,
    he embarked on a process of assessing and weighing the allegations in the
    claim one against the other and then against the external evidence he took
    into account – in the fashion of a motion for summary judgment or trial.  But
    even in doing that, he measured the allegations against a standard that was
    too restrictive.  This only fuelled the motion judge’s view that Mr. Miguna
    was unlikely to succeed at trial and, therefore, that his claims should be
    dismissed at this stage.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Evidence
    is admissible in relation to a rule 25.11 motion or in relation to the &ldquo;frivolous
    and vexatious&rdquo; aspect of a motion under rule 21.01(3)(d). It does not
    follow, however, that such a motion may be turned into an evidentiary disposition.
    The test remains: is it plain and obvious that the claim cannot succeed?
    The test is not whether it is unlikely the claim will succeed. Nor is the
    process one of weighing and assessing the evidence against the allegations
    as if the motion were a trial or a request for summary judgment.</p>
  <h3>The Fresh Amended Statement of Claim</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not propose to conduct a paragraph-by-paragraph analysis of the fresh
    amended statement of claim, as the motion judge necessarily did, or of the
    motion judge’s analysis of the allegations of malice.  Although the motion
    judge accepted that the allegations respecting the attempted strip search
    could support a claim for malice, he rejected and struck – erroneously, in
    my view –
    most of the other facts pleaded that could support the claim.  He did so,
    generally, because he thought they were either (a) insufficiently supported
    by particulars, (b) incapable of founding a claim for malice or (c) inconsistent
    with the transcript of the bail proceedings before Omatsu J. or with the
    reasons for judgment of Moore J.  I do not agree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Four
    examples will illustrate the problem with respect to the malice claim.</p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>Allegations that Mr. Miguna was Arrested
        on a Warrant and that he Made Threats to the Complainants</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    I turn to one of Mr. Miguna’s principal allegations.  It is that he was improperly
    subjected to an arrest procedure and a bail hearing as a result of misinformation
    provided to him and to the court by the Police Defendants and the Crown Defendants
    to the effect that he had been arrested on a warrant (which was not the case)
    and therefore could not be released on a Promise to Appear without the police
    conducting their normal in-station processing and without a bail hearing.  Further,
    the impact of the bail hearing on him – in the form of more stringent bail
    conditions – was exacerbated by the misrepresentation by Mr. Shallow to the
    court that one of the complainants had made allegations of indirect threats
    from Mr. Miguna.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    allegations are repeated at various points in the fresh as amended statement
    of claim, but are most directly set out a para. 23, which reads:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Mr. Miguna states as well that both the police
    and Crown defendants deliberately, maliciously and capriciously subjected
    him to a bail hearing (by lying to the Court and to him that he was arrested
    on a warrant and therefore could not be released on “A Promise to Appear” without
    a bail hearing).  <u>Defendants Shallow, Pandolfi and Chen lied to the court
    and to Mr. Miguna on 14 July 2003 both at the court and at the police station
    that one of the complainants, Amuiri, had informed Shallow that Mr. Miguna
    had communicated to Amuiri’s sister Kathuure Kebaara and sought to assert
    threats through Kebaara to Amuiri, and as such that Mr. Miguna would interfere
    with witnesses if released on bail.  Mr. Miguna states and the fact is that
    both the court and he relied on that misrepresentation and lie to his detriment
    since he went through the bail hearing that day believing that there existed
    a warrant and that Amuiri had advised the defendants of the alleged threats
    (which were false).  Mr. Miguna relied on these lies and misrepresentation
    when he proceeded to participate in the bail hearing and</u> was compelled
    to demonstrate the reasons why he should be released on bail and ended up
    being forced to abide by oppressive, restrictive and extremely inhumane conditions
    up to his acquittal.  <u>Mr. Miguna states that these bail conditions are
    contained in the document issued to him containing the terms as well as in
    the transcripts of the bail hearing before The Honourable Madam Justice Omatsu
    dated 14 July 2003.  Mr. Miguna states that he only became aware that the
    defendants had arrested him without a warrant and that Amuiri had never advised
    the defendants of the alleged threat during the trial when Amuiri took the
    stand and denounced the statement she was supposed to have made about the
    threats.</u><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge deals with this allegation at paras. 76 and 267 of his reasons.  In
    the latter paragraph the pleading is simply struck as one of a series of
    paragraphs from paragraph 15 to 27 – outlining facts founding a claim for
    malicious conduct –
    that cannot stand.  At para. 76 the motion judge states:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>With respect to the allegations in paragraph 23,
    the paragraph asserts that Mr. Shallow told the Court that Mr. Miguna had
    sought to assert threats against Amuiri through another person, Ms. Kebaara.  <i>The
    transcript of the hearing contradicts this allegation, so it is frivolous
    and scandalous.  This allegation permeates the entire paragraph so it must
    be struck. </i>[Emphasis added]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I read the July 14 transcript, however, I can find nothing that contradicts
    the allegation that Mr. Shallow told the court of the threat allegations.  Indeed,
    in my view, the transcript <i>confirms</i> that he did.  Nonetheless, whether
    the motion judge is correct in his reading of the transcript is not the point.  The
    point is that a trial – or at least a motion for summary judgment with evidence
    from the parties – is required to resolve the issue.  It should not be determined
    at the pleading stage.</p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>Reverse Onus at the Bail Hearing</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    second example involves the allegation that Mr. Shallow told the court the
    bail proceeding was a reverse onus situation.  This allegation is also repeated
    in several places in the claim.  It is relied on to show malice.  One of
    the places where the allegation is repeated is at para. 95, in the portion
    of the pleading where Mr. Miguna deals with his claim under the heading “Second
    Arrest, Assault,
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    Battery, Detention, Excessive use of Force, Malicious Prosecution and Charter
    Breaches”.  Paragraph 95 states:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Mr. Miguna states that defendant Shallow claimed
    in court and defendants Pandolfi, Chen, Couto and Alberga falsely claimed
    at the police station on 14 July 2003 that he had been arrested on a warrant
    and that because of the warrant he [Mr. Miguna] was not just required to
    be subjected to a strip search, which defendants Chen, Pandolfi, Couto, Alberga
    and Murarotto threatened, but that he was also to [be] detained subject to
    a reverse onus bail hearing wherein he had to satisfy the court that he could
    be released on conditions.  Mr. Miguna states that he relied on the defendants’ statements
    regarding the warrant and reverse onus bail hearing and participated in the
    bail hearing proceedings in which he was compelled to convince the court
    that he could be released on bail conditions.  Mr. Miguna states that the
    defendants’ deliberate misrepresentations to him and to the court described
    here were motivated by malice and they constituted an abuse of power, an
    abuse of public office, a misfeasance and malfeasance in public office against
    Shallow and an improper conduct on the part of all the defendants herein.  Mr.
    Miguna states that the defendants herein deliberately lied in order to have
    Mr. Miguna unlawfully detained and not released on bail and as such their
    actions constituted misfeasance and malfeasance in public office and improper
    conduct.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge’s treatment of this allegation is a good example of his approach
    to the disposition of the motion.  At para. 103 of the reasons he says:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Paragraph 95 alleges Mr. Shallow claimed (by implication,
    falsely) in court on July 14, 2003 that the Plaintiff had been arrested on
    a warrant and was therefore subject to a strip search and a reverse onus.  The
    transcript of the hearing that day does not record any statement about whether
    there was a warrant, but the allegation is not specific as to whether the
    alleged statement was made during the Court hearing to the Court.  The transcript
    records that Mr. Shallow told the Court that the onus was a Crown onus because
    the Crown had elected to proceed summarily, <i>This record is not clearly
    inconsistent with the allegation of the Plaintiff at the beginning of the
    paragraph but later in the paragraph the Plaintiff pleads that he relied
    on the Defendants’ statements regarding the warrant and the reverse onus
    and participated in the bail hearings effectively on that basis</i>.  In
    view of the court record that Mr. Shallow said the onus was a Crown onus,
    this statement of the plaintiff must be considered vexatious and scandalous.  <i>The
    statement affects the entire paragraph, so all of it should be struck</i>.<a href="#_ftn6"

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    short, the motion judge conducted his own assessment of the facts in the
    pleading, weighed them against each other and against the external evidence
    of the bail hearing transcript, and decided that because one allegation was
    inconsistent with another piece of <i>evidence</i> the whole of that part
    of the pleading could not stand –
    again, because he felt “the statement [affected] the entire paragraph, so
    all of it should be struck.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    technique of concluding that a particular impugned allegation “affect[ed]” or “permeate[d]” the
    entire paragraph (reasons, paras. 76 and 103, for example) was resorted to
    frequently by the motion judge throughout his reasons.  It does not necessarily
    follow, however, that simply because one portion of a pleading may not stand –
    for whatever reason – the remainder of that portion should be struck.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    transcript does show that Mr. Shallow told Omatsu J. that the bail hearing
    was a Crown onus situation.  To the extent that Mr. Miguna’s allegations
    in paras. 95, 24 and elsewhere, are intended to plead that Mr. Shallow misrepresented
    to the judge (“the court”) directly that the bail hearing involved a reverse
    onus, the pleading contradicts the record and cannot stand, subject to any
    allegation that the transcript is erroneous (which is not made).  However,
    the allegation is that Mr. Shallow “claimed in court” and, as the motion
    judge observed, “the allegation is not specific as to whether the alleged
    statement was made during the Court hearing to the Court” or whether it was
    made during discussions “in court” but prior to the bail hearing.  Thus,
    there may be – or there may not be – more to the evidence on this point as
    the case evolves.  Moreover, the motion judge conceded that the allegations
    in the pleading were not inconsistent with the bail hearing record regarding
    the arrest under warrant issue.  One wonders why the paragraph had to be
    struck in its entirety, therefore.  The point is, though, that the determination
    ought not to have been made in this fashion at this stage of the proceedings.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    third example of the same type of reasoning on the part of the motion judge
    may be found in his treatment of the allegations at para. 96 – under the
    same heading in the pleading.  Paragraph 96 pleads:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Mr. Miguna states that the defendants Pandolfi,
    Chen and Shallow knew that Amuiri<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[8]</span></span></span></a>  They also knew that even though they had claimed
    that Amuiri came forward with her allegations after the first arrest involving
    Nderitu, all the dates Amuiri purportedly gave when the alleged sexual assaults
    took place predated the single date when Nderitu claimed she was assaulted.  Mr.
    Miguna states that there was no allegation arising from any incident after
    Nderitu’s allegation.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, Mr. Miguna states that
    the defendants deliberately lied to Mr. Miguna, to his lawyer and to the
    court that Amuiri’s allegations preceded Nderitu’s and as such, Mr. Miguna
    had purportedly “continued to commit crimes after the first arrest and therefore
    there is a need to curve (<i>sic</i>) out stringent bail terms in order to
    keep a tab on Mr. Miguna’s activities and movements.”  Mr. Miguna states
    that the defendants’
    actions constituted misfeasance and malfeasance in public office.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge struck out this paragraph on the following grounds:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[106] Paragraph 96 alleges that the Defendants “lied
    to Mr. Miguna, to his lawyer and to the Court that Amuiri’s allegations preceded
    Nderitu’s and as such, Mr. Miguna had purportedly ‘contrived to commit crimes
    after the first arrest and therefore there is a need to curve (<i>sic</i>)
    out stringent bail terms in order to keep a tab on Mr. Miguna’s activities
    and movements’”.  The allegation is confusing by itself and also when read
    in the context of the paragraph in which it appears.  Earlier, the paragraph
    alleges that the Amuiri allegations related to sexual assaults allegedly
    made before the sexual assault alleged by Nderitu but the Police Defendants
    claimed the Amuiri allegations were made to them after the arrest of the
    Plaintiff in connection with the allegation made by Ms. Nderitu.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[107] According to the Reasons of Justice Moore
    dated June 23, 2004, the allegations pertaining to Ms. Amuiri relate to sexual
    assaults alleged to have occurred on September 9 and 24, 2002 and the allegation
    pertaining to Ms. Nderitu relates to a sexual assault alleged to have occurred
    on October 2, 2002.  The Plaintiff was charged in respect of the Nderitu
    allegation on November 3, 2002.  From Moore J.’s review of the evidence the
    allegations about Ms. Amuiri were first made to the police on November 13,
    2002.  This chronology is consistent with that which the Plaintiff alleges
    in the first part of paragraph 96.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[108] According to the transcript of the bail hearing,
    Mr. Shallow told the Court that the Amuiri allegation had an offence date
    of September 9, 2002 and he told the court that the (then new) charges relating
    to Amuiri allegedly predated the ones for Ms. Nderitu.  In context, his reference
    to charges would have to be taken to mean the alleged offences which were
    the subject of the charges.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[109] The Plaintiff’s counsel was present throughout
    the bail hearing and made no objection to the advice Mr. Shallow gave to
    the Court about the chronology of events.  The Plaintiff did not seek any
    review of the bail decision.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[110] For the above reasons, paragraph 96 is vexatious
    and should be struck.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    effect the motion judge determined that, while the allegations in the pleading
    were consistent with the decision of the trial judge in the criminal case,
    they may be open to a different interpretation having regard to the transcript
    of the bail hearing; therefore, the plea respecting malice in this regard
    would not likely succeed and should be struck.  Respectfully, this is not
    reasoning for a pleadings motion.  </p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>Instructions to Arrest</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    final example of this type of analysis may be found in the motion judge’s
    treatment of para. 90 of the claim, which states:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Mr. Miguna states that defendant Shallow ordered <u>defendants
      Chen and Pandolfi to arrest him in court</u> and insisted on his arrest
      and public humiliation in court when he had the choice of proceeding with
      the scheduled trial and asking the police to execute an arrest after or
      in a more humane and lawful manner.  <u>Mr. Miguna states that defendant’s
      Shallow, Chen and Pandolfi’s actions in either arresting or having him
      arrested in court in the presence of judicial officers, court workers,
      professional colleagues and members of the public scandalised him, injured
      his reputation and professional life by depicting him as a common criminal,
      caused him economic loss and caused him serious anguish and trauma.  He
      states that the defendants Shallow’s Chen’s and Pandolfi’s actions constituted
      intentional infliction of emotional stress, psychological anguish and trauma. <i></i></u></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge struck this paragraph after a lengthy analysis of the transcript
    of the bail hearing pertaining to whether and why Mr. Miguna was to be arrested
    and to the fact that Mr. Miguna’s counsel had consented at the time to the
    Crown proceeding by way of summary conviction with respect to the second
    charges.  He concluded that the allegation against Mr. Shallow in the first
    part of para. 90
    “is materially inconsistent with the record and materially misrepresents
    what happened in court.”  He therefore struck it out as vexatious and scandalous.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    remains to be seen whether Mr. Miguna can establish this allegation at trial.  However,
    he does not plead that Mr. Shallow gave the instructions to arrest while
    he (Mr. Shallow) was in court.  He pleads that Mr. Shallow gave instructions
    to arrest Mr. Miguna while Mr. Miguna was in court.  Therefore, the fact
    that the transcript may not reflect Mr. Shallow giving the instructions in
    court is not determinative.  The question is not whether Mr. Miguna will
    succeed at trial.  The question is whether the material facts as pleaded,
    and if proved, <i>could</i> support the claim alleged – in this instance,
    the claim for emotional stress.  In my view, they could.</p>
 
  <h3>Conclusion on Errors in Principle</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    foregoing examples serve to illustrate the motion judge’s treatment of the
    core allegations of malice.  They also contain the thrust of the complaints
    asserted by Mr. Miguna against the defendants and repeat the core allegations
    outlined earlier in these reasons and recited in <i>Miguna No. 1</i>.  These
    allegations are repeated and elaborated upon – and legal conclusions are
    sought to be drawn from them – elsewhere throughout the fresh amended statement
    of claim.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defendants complain, on the one hand, that the allegations in the pleading
    are “bald and conclusory”, and, on the other hand, that they are verbose
    and “repetitive”.  They are, to some extent, the authors of this dichotomy.  Mr.
    Miguna was attempting to respond to their repeated demands that he provide
    further particulars and that he compartmentalize his allegations in accordance
    with his asserted causes of action.  As noted above, he declined to do the
    latter, pointing out that the allegations were “interwoven and intertwined.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the effect is that allegations are repeated throughout the claim as Mr. Miguna
    moves from subject to subject and from targeted defendants to targeted defendants,
    sometimes with more particularity and sometimes with less.  Occasionally –
    for example in paras 121 through 143 – he pleads legal conclusions, without
    repeating much in the way of particulars.  When the claim is read as a whole,
    however, the defendants are provided with sufficient particulars of the various
    allegations, and of the legal conclusions flowing from them, to enable them
    to plead to the allegations.  The discovery phase of the action will enable
    them to pinpoint the allegations – and the <i>evidence</i> supporting them – further.  That
    is one of the functions of the discovery phase.   To repeat the observations
    of Justice Grange, in <i>Temilini</i> (at p. 668):</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>When the case appears only to lack evidence, so
    long as the gaps may be filled, either by discovery or the revelation of
    evidence at trial, the case should be allowed to proceed.  Trials are notoriously
    unpredictable.  </p>

    motion judge also struck pleadings for making claims not grounded in any
    cause of action known to law.  I agree with the motion judge that “excessive
    use of force” and “loss of income” do not constitute separate and recognized
    causes of action.  To the extent the allegations relating to those claims
    are intended to do so, they cannot stand.  However, allegations relating
    to excessive use of force may be relevant to the other causes of action asserted
    and to the claims for damages arising out of them. “Loss of income” is a
    damage claim arising from the other causes of action as well.  I would not

    16 sets out the essential particulars underpinning the “no reasonable and
    probable cause” allegations with respect to the claims against Crown Defendants
    Shallow and Braley.  It does so in 34 subparagraphs – (a) through (oo).  Messrs.
    Shallow and Braley are said to have initiated and continued the prosecutions
    when they knew or ought to have known a lengthy litany of facts that showed
    the charges were without merit.  With very little analysis these allegations
    were struck, apparently on the basis that they <i>could not</i> establish
    lack of reasonable and probable cause or malice generally.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    Court has held that continuing a prosecution in the absence of reasonable
    and probable grounds is capable of giving rise to an inference of malice:
    see <i>Oniel v. Metropolitan Toronto (Municipality) Police Force</i>, [2001]
    O.J. No. 90 (C.A.); <i>Folland v. Ontario</i> (2003), 64 O.R. (3d) 89 (C.A.).  In <i>Oniel</i>,
    at paras. 54-55, Borins J.A. said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Although the prosecutor may have reasonable and
    probable cause to commence a prosecution, if the prosecutor obtains information
    which suggests that the person probably did not commit the offence, or recklessly
    disregards advice that such information could be obtained through routine
    investigative steps, the prosecutor lacks reasonable and probable cause to
    continue the prosecution, and malice may be inferred.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>… Continuing the prosecution in the absence of
    an honest belief in the appellant’s guilt would be incompatible with securing
    the ends of justice, and malice could be inferred if the respondents continued
    the prosecution with <b>reckless</b> indifference to the truth.  Continuing
    a prosecution in these circumstances would not be using the criminal justice
    system for the purpose for which it was intended. [Emphasis in original]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    is the nub of the allegations in para. 16 of the claim: the defendants Shallow
    and Braley initiated or continued the prosecutions against Mr. Miguna when
    they knew, or ought to have known – based upon the thirty-nine specific facts
    pleaded – that he had probably not committed the offences in question.  Some
    of these particulars may seem remote and far-reaching.  However, taken cumulatively – and
    assuming they can be proved – I do not see how it can be said that they <i>could
    not</i> form the components of a finding of lack of reasonable and probable
    cause and, flowing from that, of malice.  While the “ought to have known” plea
    is not a specific plea of recklessness, it nonetheless bears on the defendants’ state
    of mind, which is an important component of both reasonable and probable
    grounds and of malice.</p>

    18 of the claim outlines the plaintiff’s factual complaints in support of
    the assertion that the Police Defendants committed assault and battery against
    him.  The motion judge appears to have concluded that because the allegation
    with respect to the threatened strip search did not involve any physical
    contact, no facts supporting the claim for battery were pleaded.  Again,
    that is not the case.  The particulars of the alleged assault <i>and battery</i> include:</p>

    threatened strip search is not the only material fact relied upon in this
    connection.</p>

    paras. 107-144 of the claim Mr. Miguna makes “additional specific allegations
    against Roger Shallow”.  For the most part, they repeat – sometimes in a
    more general summary manner – allegations made earlier in the pleading.  With
    the exception of para. 107 (which merely pleads that Mr. Shallow is an employee
    of the Crown and was the person who prosecuted Mr. Miguna), the motion judge
    struck these paragraphs in their entirety.  He did so for a variety of reasons,
    including that the allegations were “conclusory”, “bald”, “frivolous and
    vexatious”, and that they consisted of “assumptions and speculations”, and
    were assisted by the reasons of Justice Moore.  In my view he erred in this
    regard.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    repeat, the pleading must be read as whole.  When that is done it is apparent – with
    a few inconsequential exceptions – what is being alleged and what the particulars
    of those allegations are.  The motion judge concluded that some of the allegations
    were nothing but assumption and speculation because the particulars provided
    were not, themselves, supported by further particulars.  Parties are not
    required to plead the evidence by which material facts will be proved.  The
    fact that material facts, supported by particulars, are not further supported
    by additional particulars does not mean that the allegations are merely assumptions
    or speculation.  Finally, in weighing portions of the pleading against the
    reasons of Moore J., the motion judge repeated the error – already discussed
    above – of effectively transforming the pleadings motion into a motion for
    summary judgment or a trial. </p>

    118 – amongst the specific allegations against Mr. Shallow – received separate
    treatment from the motion judge.  Its allegations are particularly stark.  Mr.
    Miguna asserts that Mr. Shallow
    “persistently, recklessly and fraudulently misrepresented facts and evidence
    to the Ontario Court of Justice … purporting them to be true and accurate
    in his desperate attempts to have Mr. Miguna falsely prosecuted and/or convicted
    when he either knew or ought to have known that the assertions he was making
    in Court were clearly false, fabricated, concocted and baseless.”  Over the
    course of 29 subparagraphs and six pages of his pleading, Mr. Miguna then
    set out the particulars of Mr. Shallow’s alleged “conspiracies, false, contrived,
    concocted, reckless, fabricated assertions and fraudulent misrepresentations.”  It
    bears repeating again that none of these allegations is proven; they are
    mere allegations.  However, they are detailed allegations.</p>

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(ii) ordered or was complicit in the arrest at

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(v) misinformed the court with respect to the relationship

    Kebaara and Anne Marie Mundia);</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(vi) misinformed the court with respect to a long
    series of facts concerning Ms. Amuiri and Ms. Nderitu when he knew or should

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the conclusion of para. 118, Mr. Miguna pleads that all of the listed particulars
    demonstrate the type of activities incompatible with Mr. Shallow’s status
    as “minister of justice” and indicative of a deliberate and improper use
    of the office of Attorney General or Crown Attorney.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    allegations are very serious.  I reiterate: Mr. Miguna has not proved them
    yet, and, as previously noted, he fails to prove them at his peril in terms
    of costs and perhaps his reputation: <i>Miguna No. 1</i>, para. 17.  “Proof” is
    not the issue at this stage, however.  I have no hesitation in concluding
    that, taken as a whole, <u>if</u> they are proved, the facts alleged <u>could</u> form
    the basis of a finding of liability against Mr. Shallow.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    striking the allegations in para. 118, the motion judge first took issue
    with the “ought to have known” portion of the plea that Mr. Shallow “knew
    or ought to have known” that his assertions in court were false.  For reasons
    that I have previously indicated, I would not strike out the “ought to have
    known”
    allegation against Mr. Shallow in the circumstances of this case.  While
    there is no claim against the Crown Attorneys for negligent investigation,
    their state of mind is very much in play in the action.  Proof – if it can
    be established
    – that they ought to have known various facts, in combination with other
    facts, <i>may</i> constitute a building block towards proof of malice, although
    clearly insufficient to do so on its own.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge dealt with the other allegations in para. 118 in various ways.  He
    dismissed a number of them because he found that they were inconsistent with
    what appeared in the transcript of the bail hearing or the reasons for judgment
    of Moore J.  For reasons that I have explained, this was an erroneous approach.  Others
    he dismissed because – although he could not find inconsistencies
    – he found the allegations to amount to “assumptions and speculation”, relying
    upon the statement of Dickson J. in <i>Operation Dismantle</i> [1985] 1 S.C.R.
    441 at p. 455 that “allegations based on assumptions and speculation” need
    not be taken as true.  I do not think it can be said, upon a reading of the
    pleading as a whole, that the impugned allegations fall into that category.  It
    may well be that Mr. Miguna is not able to prove them in the end.  That,
    however, is a different matter.</p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>Paragraphs 144-168</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    paras. 144 through 168, Mr. Miguna pleads “specific allegations against Mr.
    Braley”.  As with the specific allegations against Mr. Shallow, these claims
    were struck too (except for the initial paragraph stating that Mr. Braley
    was the chief Crown Attorney at the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    1000 Finch Avenue West courthouse and a prosecutor of Mr. Miguna).  They
    were struck on the basis that they were “almost entirely bald and conclusory.”  Again,
    however, the allegations must be read as part of the pleading as a whole,
    and when that is done it is readily apparent what the particulars of the
    various allegations against Mr. Braley are.</p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>Paragraphs 169-207</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    a similar fashion, Mr. Miguna sets out what he calls
    “additional particulars on [the Police Defendants]” in paras. 169-207 of
    the claim.  Because the motion judge permitted the action to proceed against
    all of the Police Defendants except for the defendant Leaver, on the claims
    of <i>Charter</i> breach (ss. 7, 8 and 15 only), abuse of power and assault,
    all of these portions of the pleading were not struck.  However, the parts
    relating to malicious prosecution, racial profiling, negligent investigation,
    false arrest and false imprisonment, and battery were.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    racial profiling allegations are particularly important to Mr. Miguna’s claim
    because, if established, they would tend to show malice, abuse of power and
    possibly a lack of reasonable and probable cause.  At paras. 175 and 176
    he pleads:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[175]  Chen, Pandolfi and Murarotto deliberately
    detained Mr. Miguna at the 32 Division station rather than issuing a promise
    to appear at his offices or elsewhere due to their tendency at racial profiling
    and anti-black racism.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[176]  Defendants Chen, Pandolfi, Leaver, Murarotto,
    Couto and Alberga racially profiled Mr. Miguna and believed that he had committed
    the alleged crimes due to their racism and discriminatory tendencies and
    not because of any credible evidence or any reasonable or probable grounds.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge disposed of these allegations with the following cryptic comment
    at para. 294 of his reasons:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Paragraph 175 alleges “a tendency at racial profiling
    and anti-black racism”.  The paragraph alleges no facts in support, unlike
    the allegations which the Court of Appeal found acceptable in <i>Gnanasegaram
    v. Allianz Insurance Co. of Canada</i>, [2005] O.J. No. 1076 so it should
    be struck.  Paragraph 176 is speculative and cannot stand.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Again,
    taking the paragraphs in isolation, the critique may be justified.  However,
    the racial profiling allegations had already been outlined earlier in the
    pleading and racial profiling is listed in para. 182 as one of the ways in
    which the Police Defendants abused their powers.  In paras. 11-14 Mr. Miguna
    pleads:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[11]  <u>Mr. Miguna states that the police defendants,
      Pandolfi, Chen, Couto and Alberga had no justification for arresting him
      in the manner described above, particularly because they had not obtained
      a warrant for his arrest, he had no criminal record, he had not violated
      a condition of his release or “undertakings”, the alleged complainants
      lacked credibility and the police defendants had not confirmed, verified,
      cross-checked or corroborated any of the complaints or
    “stories”, and the police defendants were not observing or had not observed
    him commit a crime.  Mr. Miguna states further that the police defendants
    had no justification for taking him to the police station and detaining him
    there for an unreasonably long period of time.  Mr. Miguna states that the
    manner of his arrest was unreasonably oppressive and it was consistent with
    the practice of racial profiling</u>.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[12]  <u>Mr. Miguna states that the police officers
      refused or failed to simply issue him with “A Promise to Appear Form”,
      like they ended up doing at the police station on 4 November 2002, without
      the warrantless public arrest, detention and transportation to the police
      station.  In the alternative, Mr. Miguna states that the police could have
      invited him to the police station for the arrest to be effected, but chose
      not to do so due to their malicious intent.</u></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[13]  <u>Mr. Miguna states that, at all material
      times, the police defendants routinely charged white professionals or lawyers
      without arresting, handcuffing, detaining them in public or humiliating
      them in the manner they did to him.  Mr. Miguna states that the police
      defendants treated him in the manner pleaded because he was an African
      and they unreasonably believed that he must have committed the crimes alleged
      merely because of who he was and not because of any reasonable and probable
      cause.  As well, Mr. Miguna states that the defendant police officers unreasonably
      believed that they were justified to treat him in a cruel, oppressive and
      discriminatory manner because he was African and Black.</u></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[14] The police defendants chose to arrest Mr.
    Miguna in full public view in both his law offices as well as at the College
    Park Courthouse due to their malicious intent, deliberate decision to abuse
    their powers, public office and in order to use excessive force against him.<u></u></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    the exception of the words “and it was consistent with the practice of racial
    profiling” at the end of para. 11, the motion judge permitted paras. 11-14
    to stand.  When paras. 175 and 176 are read in this context, it is apparent
    that the pleading does, indeed contain facts in support of them and – assuming
    the pleaded facts are true – that para. 176 is not speculative.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to the other allegations asserting
    “additional particulars on [the Police Defendants]” in support of the claims
    for malicious prosecution, abuse of power, negligent investigation, false
    arrest and false imprisonment, and battery, the motion judge’s reasoning
    is subject to the same criticism as that made earlier with respect to his
    treatment of the “additional specific allegations” against Crown Attorneys
    Shallow and Braley.  The “additional particulars” are really a specific summary
    of the nature of the allegations being raised against the Police Defendants
    in the action.  Read in the context of the entire pleading, the allegations
    are sufficiently clear to enable the defendants to plead to them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the end of the day – subject to what follows – I am satisfied that the fresh
    amended statement of claim contains allegations of fact which, if proved,
    could form the basis for liability against the Crown Defendants and the Police
    Defendants as alleged (Mr. Miguna advances no claim for negligent investigation
    as against the Crown Defendants).  While the pleading is not a model, and
    may even offend the rules respecting pleading in various isolated instances,
    it is apparent when it is read as a whole what the substance of the allegations
    made against the defendants is and what the particulars supporting those
    allegations are.  A pleading need not be perfect.  The defendants are able
    to know what the allegations against them, and the particulars of those allegations,
    are, and they are able to plead to them.  It is time for them to do so.</p>
  <h3>The Claim against Detective Leaver</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge dealt with Detective Leaver separately and dismissed the action
    against her in its entirety.  She is not alleged to have participated in
    the strip search incident.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Detective
    Leaver testified at the criminal trial.  She was the officer who took the
    call from a worker at Covenant House about a complaint by Ms. Nderitu, and
    who first spoke to Ms. Nderitu.  Mr. Miguna alleges, amongst other things,
    that Detective Leaver:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>told
    Ms. Nderitu that there were three other clients who were making sexual assault
    complaints against him and that her complaint would be strengthened as a
    result of that (Detective Leaver denied this assertion before Moore&nbsp;J.); </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>swore
    an information against him when she had not conducted a proper investigation
    and therefore could not have formed a reasonable belief about his culpability;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>participated
    with the other Police Defendants and with Ms. Amuiri in concocting Ms. Amuiri’s
    claim against him; </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>d)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>participated
    with the other Police Defendants in posting Mr. Miguna’s name, the charges
    against him and the false allegations against him on the Internet and in
    the media; and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>e)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>participated
    with the other Police Defendants in racially profiling him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge appears to have dismissed the claim against Detective Leaver
    on the basis that the allegations lacked particularity, that Moore J. had
    not found that she had lied in her testimony, and that the allegations in
    (d) above constituted a collateral attack on the disposition in a companion
    defamation action that Mr. Miguna had commenced.  Again, I respectfully disagree.  The
    allegations in (d) above do not constitute a collateral attack on another
    proceeding in these circumstances; if proved, they are another group of facts
    in a series of facts relied upon to show malice and use of public office
    for an improper purpose.  With respect to the other allegations – for the
    reasons relating to the other Police Defendants – I am satisfied that the
    pleading adequately sets out the claim against Detective Leaver in a fashion
    that enables her to know the allegations she has to meet and to plead a defence
    to them.  As with the other defendants, the allegations are, of course, nothing
    but allegations at this point.</p>
  
  <h3>The Claims Against Chief Fantino</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    potential liability of Chief Fantino and the Toronto Police Services Board
    is dictated in some respects by legislation not applicable to the other defendants.  While
    I agree with the motion judge’s review of the relevant law pertaining to
    the claim asserted against Chief Fantino, I respectfully disagree with his
    conclusion that the claim should be struck at this stage. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the motion judge noted, a chief of police is not vicariously liable for the
    acts of his or her police officers during the course of their employment: <i>Pringle
    v.
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    London (City) Police Force</i>, [1997] O.J. No. 1834 (
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), at para. 2.  Nor is the chief responsible for policy matters relating
    to police operations, which are within the purview of the Police Services
    Board:<i> Police Services Act</i> R.S.O. 1990 c. P. 15, s. 31.  However,
    a chief of police <i>is</i> responsible for the day-to-day operation of the
    police force.  Subparagraphs 41(1) (a) and (b) of the <i>Police Services
    Act </i>state:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>41(1) The duties of a chief of police include,</p>
  <p class=clause-e>(a) in the case of a municipal police force, administering
    the police force and overseeing its operation in accordance with the objectives,
    priorities and policies established by the board under subsection 31&nbsp;(1);</p>
  <p class=clause-e>(b) ensuring that members of the police force carry out their
    duties in accordance with this Act and the regulations and in a manner that
    reflects the needs of the community, and that discipline is maintained in
    the police force;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Therefore
    a claim <i>could</i> lie against Chief Fantino in negligence, if properly
    framed and pleaded.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    paras. 40-45 of the fresh amended statement of claim the Chief is alleged,
    essentially, to have been negligent, reckless or wilfully blind in fulfilling
    his statutory responsibilities for the day-to-day operations of his police
    force (<i>Police Services Act, </i>s.&nbsp;41).  The factual basis for this
    claim is said to be that he failed to exercise his supervisory and managerial
    authority over the Police Defendants by failing to ensure that the Police
    Defendants were adequately trained and did not engage in the improper conduct
    attributed to them in the pleading – and particularized in para. 41, subparagraphs
    (a) through (kk).  Chief Fantino is alleged to have been grossly negligent
    or negligent in failing to order a comprehensive review of this conduct,
    to have encouraged and condoned the creation of an environment that fostered
    such conduct, and to have acted “capriciously, recklessly, negligently, incompetently
    or he was wilfully blind regarding the negligence, negligent investigations,
    recklessness, racial profiling and racism of the defendant police officers”.  He
    is alleged to have been motivated, in effect, by a desire to retaliate against
    Mr. Miguna because the latter “had acted against Fantino in previous litigation
    (both on behalf [of himself] or on behalf of his clients)”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge acknowledged that the failure of the Chief to take the steps
    he allegedly should have taken “could be negligent if he knew or had reason
    to know that the alleged misconduct was occurring and did not act against
    it”, but he concluded that there were no allegations in the claim to that
    effect (Reasons, para. 306).  Similarly, the failure to take such steps might
    be negligent if the Chief failed to ensure that procedures were in place
    to identify and report instances of misconduct of the sort put against the
    Police Defendants, but again the motion judge found no such allegations in
    the pleading. Finally, the motion judge concluded that the allegation regarding
    the failure to conduct a comprehensive review could not stand because there
    was no suggestion that such a review had been requested or that the Chief
    had a duty to conduct one.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Keeping
    in mind that pleadings are to be read generously at this stage and that the
    facts, as alleged, are to be taken as true, I arrive at a different conclusion.  The
    assertion is that the Chief was reckless or wilfully blind in his approach
    to what is said to have been going on and, indeed, that he was motivated
    by extraneous considerations in not taking steps to intervene or to correct
    the alleged misconduct.  Of course these serious allegations are merely allegations
    at this stage, and nothing has been proved.  <i>If</i> they are established,
    however, they <i>could</i> give rise to personal liability on the part of
    Chief Fantino, as opposed to a vicarious liability claim based on the conduct
    of the Police Defendants.  This is not one of those clear cases where it
    can be said to be plain and obvious that the claim cannot succeed. </p>
  <h3>The Claim against the

    Toronto Police Services Board</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the same time, I agree with the decision of the motion judge to dismiss the
    claim against the Toronto Police Services Board (“the Board”) except to the
    extent the Board may be vicariously liable for the acts of the Police Defendants
    and the Chief of Police.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge correctly accepted that a Police Services Board cannot perform
    or be held responsible for operational functions of a police force.  Such
    matters are the responsibility of the Chief of Police: see <i>Odhavji Estate
    v. Woodhouse</i> (2000), 52 O.R. (3d) 181 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), at paras. 51-54; aff’d [2003] 3 S.C.R. 263; <i>Police Services Act</i>,
    ss. 31 and 41.  The Board has no authority to supervise the Police Defendants,
    although it does direct the Chief of Police and monitor his or her performance.  It
    is precluded from giving directions to the Chief with respect to specific
    operational decisions or with respect to the day-to-day operation of the
    police force: s. 31(4).   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    thrust of Mr. Miguna’s allegations against the Board is that the Board – acting
    on ulterior motives flowing from Mr. Miguna’s previous clashes with it and
    the Chief of Police personally – failed to prevent the very conduct Chief
    Fantino is alleged to have failed to prevent.  The conduct asserted, however,
    is conduct that falls with the operational scope of the force’s activity,
    an area over which the Board has no power or control.  The allegations that
    the Board failed to supervise the Chief of Police and ensure that he fulfilled
    his statutory obligations under the <i>Police Services Act</i> add nothing
    to the claim that is not encompassed in the Board’s potential vicarious liability. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    action against the Toronto Police Services Board in all respects except for
    the vicarious liability claims cannot succeed, therefore, regardless of motivation,
    and was properly dismissed.  I would permit para. 36 of the fresh amended
    statement of claim to remain in its entirety, but strike paras. 37- 39.</p>
  <h3>Allegations that are to Remain Struck</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do agree with the motion judge that paras. 28 through 33 and para. 74 of
    the fresh amended statement of claim cannot stand.  The allegations in those
    paragraphs are based on Mr. Miguna’s assertion that “he has reason to believe” in
    the facts set out.  As this Court noted in <i>Miguna No. 1</i>, at para.
    18, “Mr. Miguna must have knowledge of the facts supporting his claims and
    not merely plead allegations that he believes may or may not be true.” </p>

    Crown Defendants argued that Mr. Miguna’s allegations of prosecutorial misconduct
    were not raised during the criminal proceedings, but should have been, and
    that to permit him to raise them now in a subsequent civil proceeding would
    amount to permitting a collateral attack on the criminal proceedings and
    an abuse of process.  They rely on this Court’s decision in <i>Gilbert v.
    Gilkinson</i>, [2005] O.J. No. 5347 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Gilbert</i>,
    this Court upheld a decision by Spence J. dismissing a claim against three
    Crown Attorneys and a lawyer for alleged misconduct arising out of the plaintiff’s
    prosecution for breach of bail conditions and domestic assault.  He was convicted
    on both matters.  One of his allegations was that one of the Crown Attorneys
    had lied to the court in describing a certain document during the bail hearing.  The
    Court held, amongst other things, that to allow him to pursue such an allegation
    would amount to an impermissible collateral attack on the bail order and
    the allegation was struck on abuse of process grounds.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    are significant difference between this case and that of Mr. Gilbert, however.  For
    one thing, Mr. Gilbert was convicted in the criminal proceedings whereas
    Mr. Miguna was acquitted.  For another, Mr. Gilbert asserted no claim for
    malicious prosecution.  In addition, the Court in that case was satisfied
    that there were no allegations in the pleading which, taken separately or
    read cumulatively as a whole, could support any allegation of maliciously
    improper conduct on the part of the defendants.  That is not the case here.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    while I would not preclude the defendants from raising the <i>Gilbert v.
    Gilkerson</i> ground as a defence – if so advised – I would not strike out
    the claims, or any portions of them, on that basis, at this stage of the
    proceedings.  </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge made no order as to costs.  The Police Defendants, Chief Fantino
    and the Toronto Police Services Board seek leave to appeal, and if leave
    is granted, appeal from that decision.  In view of the foregoing disposition
    it is unnecessary to deal with this cross-appeal.  Mr. Miguna has been substantially
    successful.</p>
