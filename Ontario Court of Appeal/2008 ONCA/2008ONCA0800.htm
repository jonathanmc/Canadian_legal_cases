  <h4><span lang=EN-US>OVERVIEW</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    appeal involves the difficult issue of determining whether a custodial sentence
    is appropriate for an aboriginal offender who pleaded guilty to a charge
    of aggravated assault on her two year old child that left the child with
    permanent and debilitating injuries. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant has had a difficult life in remote First Nations communities in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Northern Ontario.  She was removed from her family and community and relocated
    to a residential school at a young age.  She has suffered the loss of her
    parents, struggled with alcoholism and endured the apprehension of her children. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sentencing judge sentenced the appellant to two years less a day in custody.  Shortly
    before the hearing of this appeal, she was released on parole after having
    served eight months of her sentence.  She has now returned to her community
    and argues that her sentence should be reduced to time served.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the following reasons, I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h3>The Offence</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the time of the offence, the appellant was living with her spouse, John Tait,
    in a remote fly-in aboriginal community in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    Northern Ontario called Sachigo Lake First Nation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Due
    to the appellant and Tait’s excessive drinking, their son Pesim was apprehended
    by Tikinagan Child and Family Services shortly after his birth and shortly
    before the appellant gave birth to another child named
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Bryan.  Pesim was returned after
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Bryan’s birth, but he did not bond with his mother.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    Pesim was two years old and
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Bryan was 10 months old, the appellant became frustrated with Pesim’s crying.  She
    threw Pesim into his crib and then pushed him down.  Pesim suffered a severe
    blow to his head and was rendered unconscious.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant called Tait to take Pesim to the nursing station.  Pesim was airlifted
    to
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Winnipeg for surgery to relieve the swelling in his brain.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    questioned by the police in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Winnipeg, the appellant stated that Pesim’s injuries were sustained as a
    result of a fall.  A year later, a police investigation was launched and
    when questioned by the police, the appellant confessed to the assault.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    assault has had a devastating effect on Pesim.  He has developed epilepsy
    and has symptoms of paralysis on the right side of his body.  At the time
    of sentencing, his condition was described as “very dismal with virtually
    no chance, barring some miracle, that he will ever function close to normally.”  While
    his condition appears to have improved somewhat, there is no doubt that he
    has suffered permanent brain damage and physical injuries that will continue
    to affect him for the rest of his life.</p>
  <h3>The Offender</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sentencing judge was provided with a detailed pre-sentence report outlining
    the background and circumstances of the appellant.  She was born in 1972
    in Osnaberg First Nation, where she lived with her parents and siblings until
    early adolescence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s family lived a traditional life.  Her father worked on a trap
    line and took his family with him to work on the line.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    family service agency insisted that the family’s school-age children attend
    school.  As a result, the appellant was taken from her family and sent to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">
    Poplar
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Hill
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Residential
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    School.  The conditions there were strict and harsh.  She and her siblings
    were strapped for speaking their native language or for falling asleep in
    church.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    the appellant was 13, her family moved to Slate Falls First Nation.  The
    appellant left Poplar Hill shortly thereafter to be with her mother who was
    dying of cancer.  Her mother died one year later and the appellant remained
    at home to look after her father and younger siblings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two
    years later, the appellant’s father died in a boating accident.  The appellant
    recalls her father’s death as a tragic turning point in her life.  After
    he died, she collapsed into alcoholism.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Prior
    to giving birth to Pesim, the appellant had three children.  None of her
    older children resided with her at the time of Pesim’s birth.  One of them
    lived in
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Slate
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Falls and the other two lived with their father in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Sachigo
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Lake. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the appellant has struggled with alcohol abuse since her father’s death,
    at the time of the offence, she lived in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Sachigo
    <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">
    Lake, a dry community, and abided by the community bylaw which prohibits
    alcohol consumption.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    pre-sentence report described the community’s reaction to the appellant’s
    crime in the following terms:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The council members willing to attempt to talk
    about this in private all struggled to find words to express the complexity
    of their feelings.  They understand the issues.  They know that parents everywhere
    struggle with the challenges of parenting. They know that many adults in
    their community were not taught parenting skills or even experienced positive
    parenting as children.  Yet they continue to express anger and sadness for
    the state the child’s in and they are pained by how he will likely never
    have any type of normal life.  In the end, the Chief and council have decided
    not to make any formal response to this offence acknowledging this situation
    as being too close to them.  The Chief and council say they will fully support
    the decision of the court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant has no previous criminal record.</p>
  <h3>Sentencing Proceedings</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    plea and sentencing proceedings took place in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Sachigo
    <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">
    Lake.  Defence counsel asked the sentencing judge to consider a conditional
    sentence of two years less a day, to be served in the community.  The sentencing
    judge adopted the position of the Crown and imposed a custodial sentence
    of two years less a day plus three years probation.</p>
  <h3>Fresh Evidence</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant has submitted as fresh evidence a <i>Gladue</i> report providing
    further details of her life circumstances.  This report essentially confirms
    and elaborates on the details contained in the pre-sentence report but also
    adds some new information.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    report provides some general information relating to residential schools,
    including the Government of Canada’s 2008 apology as well as information
    from studies describing the trauma and detrimental effects of the residential
    school experience. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    report also indicates that the appellant was sexually abused by an older
    brother shortly after her mother died from cancer and that the fathers of
    her two eldest children were abusive towards her.  It confirms that the appellant
    has had problems with alcohol since the age of 17.  From time to time, the
    appellant has sought help with her drinking and has expressed a willingness
    to participate in alternative justice and traditional healing activities
    as part of her rehabilitation.  The appellant is remorseful for her crime.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    report concludes as follows: “Since Ruby was paroled with conditions, no
    further recommendations are being made.”</p>
  <h3>ISSUES</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant asks that leave to appeal be granted, that the appeal be allowed,
    and that her sentence be reduced to one of time served.  She argues that
    the sentencing judge erred:</p>
  <p align=left style='
text-align:left;
'>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>in
    failing to give adequate consideration to her circumstances as an aboriginal
    offender and;</p>
  <p align=left style='text-align:left;
'>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>in
    treating certain features of the offence as aggravating factors.</p>
  <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
  <h3>ANALYSIS</h3>
  <h3>(<i><span style='font-weight:normal'>1)       Consideration of the appellant’s
        circumstances as an aboriginal offender</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I have already indicated, the sentencing judge had the benefit of a detailed
    pre-sentence report that provided her with considerable details regarding
    the appellant’s background and circumstances.<i>  </i>The sentencing judge
    also had the benefit of very fulsome submissions from defence counsel.  Her
    counsel argued that, in view of the principles enunciated in <i>R. v. Gladue</i>,
    [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688 and the appellant’s background and circumstances, including
    her residential school experience, a conditional sentence to be served in
    the community would be appropriate<i>.</i>  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    light of the materials before her and the submissions of defence counsel,
    I am satisfied that the sentencing judge was fully apprised of the appellant’s
    background as an aboriginal offender.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also submits that the sentencing judge held that the <i>Gladue</i> principles
    had little or no bearing on the sentence since the appellant had committed
    an offence involving serious violence.  The appellant submits that in so
    holding, the sentencing judge erred.  She focuses on the following passage
    from the sentencing judge’s oral reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The issue here, as indicated in the Ontario Court
    of Appeal decision of <u>R. v. Cudmore</u>, [[1972] 1 O.R. 812] is about
    denunciation and general deterrence and the importance of protecting children
    who cannot protect themselves.  Although I have considered the Gladue component
    here, I accept the position in <u>R. v. Wells</u> [[2000] 1 S.C.R. 207] that
    as a practical matter, particularly violent and serious offences will result
    in imprisonment for aboriginal offenders as well as for non-aboriginal offenders.  Therefore,
    while rehabilitation of the mother must be considered, general deterrence
    and denunciation must be the primary consideration.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the appellant that the <i>Gladue</i> principles, which provide
    a framework for interpreting s. 718.2(e) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, must
    be considered when sentencing an aboriginal offender who has committed an
    offence involving serious violence.  This issue was fully canvassed by this
    court in <i>R. v. Kakekagamick</i> (2006), 81 O.R. (3d) 664.  There, LaForme
    J.A. held that “regardless of the seriousness of the offence, the analysis
    set out in <i>Gladue </i>will nevertheless apply in all cases where the offender
    is an Aboriginal person.”  At para. 56 he added: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[W]here a sentencing judge does not properly take
    into account the circumstances of the Aboriginal offender as required by
    s. 718.2(e) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, and fails to properly and adequately
    conduct the inquiry set out in <i>Gladue</i>, it amounts to an error justifying
    appellate intervention.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    at para. 36, LaForme J.A.<i> </i>also made clear that s. 718.2(e) and the
    principles in <i>Gladue</i> mandate “a different methodology for assessing
    a fit sentence for an Aboriginal offender” but “not necessarily… a different
    result.”  As set out in <i>Gladue</i>,<i> </i>at para. 66,<i> </i>the different
    methodology requires the sentencing judge to consider:</p>
  <p>(A) The unique systemic or background factors which may have played a part
    in bringing the particular aboriginal offender before the courts; and</p>
  <p>(B) The types of sentencing procedures and sanctions which may be appropriate
    in the circumstances for the offender because of his or her particular aboriginal
    heritage or connection. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>Gladue</i> methodology
    can and should yield information that is capable of influencing the sentencing
    judge’s determination of the appropriate type and length of sentence to be
    imposed.  However, at the end of the day, it remains for the sentencing judge
    to consider the case as a whole.  The task of the sentencing judge is to
    weigh the aboriginal offender’s circumstances and his or her interest in
    rehabilitation or restorative justice with the community’s interests in deterrence,
    denunciation, and the need for social protection.  In the case of serious
    and violent offences, even for aboriginal offenders, the balance will often
    tilt in favour of the latter interests.  In <i>Gladue</i>, Cory and Iacobucci
    JJ. stated at para. 79: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Generally, the more violent and serious the offence
    the more likely it is as a practical reality that the terms of the imprisonment
    for aboriginals and non-aboriginals will be close to each other or the same,
    even taking into account their different concepts of sentencing. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    same principle was referred to by LaForme J.A. in <i>Kakekagamick</i>, at
    para. 43.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Iacobucci
    J. elaborated on this point in the following passage from <i>R. v. Wells</i>,
    [2000] 1 S.C.R. 207, at para 42, which was referred to and paraphrased by
    the sentencing judge in her reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Notwithstanding what may well be different approaches
    to sentencing as between aboriginal and non-aboriginal conceptions of sentencing,
    it is reasonable to assume that for some aboriginal offenders, and depending
    upon the nature of the offence, the goals of denunciation and deterrence
    are fundamentally relevant to the offender’s community.&nbsp; As held in <i>Gladue</i>,
    at para. 79, to the extent that generalizations may be made, the more violent
    and serious the offence, the more likely as a practical matter that the appropriate
    sentence will not differ as between aboriginal and non-aboriginal offenders,
    given that in these circumstances, the goals of denunciation and deterrence
    are accorded increasing significance.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    my reading of the entire record of this case, I am satisfied that the sentencing
    judge was faithful to the <i>Gladue</i> methodology and that she arrived
    at an appropriate sentence after taking into account the appellant’s circumstances
    and aboriginal heritage.
     No doubt her reasons for sentence could have been more complete, but in
    my view, when read in the light of the record as a whole, they illustrate
    that the she arrived at a sentence that balanced the need for deterrence,
    denunciation and social protection with the appellant’s background and circumstances
    and the need for restorative justice.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sentencing judge’s conclusion that a custodial sentence of two years less
    a day was required to meet the need for “denunciation and general deterrence
    and the importance of protecting children who cannot protect themselves” was
    certainly open to her on the record, even after giving full consideration
    to the circumstances and tragic life experiences of the appellant.  The offence
    involved a violent assault against a defenceless child who was left with
    a devastating and lasting brain injury.  It was the type of crime contemplated
    in <i>Gladue</i>, <i>Wells </i>and <i>Kakekagamick</i> as likely to result
    in a custodial sentence.  Moreover, in the circumstances of this case, it
    was far from clear that a conditional sentence to be served in the community<i> </i>was
    a realistic possibility given the aboriginal community’s ambivalent reaction
    to the crime. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I would not give effect to this ground of appeal. </p>
  <h3><i><span style='font-weight:normal'>(2)       Did the sentencing judge
        err in assessing certain aggravating factors?</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    her reasons for sentence, the sentencing judge treated as aggravating factors:
    (1) the fact that after the appellant assaulted Pesim, she called her husband
    rather than the health clinic or the police; and (2) the fact that she did
    not confess to the crime until one year after it occurred. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the appellant that the sentencing judge may well have misapprehended
    the exigencies of the appellant’s living situation in this remote fly-in
    community.  There is considerable merit to the appellant’s submission that
    by calling her husband, she did in fact seek and secure the most immediate
    medical assistance for her child available to her in the circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, in my view, the sentencing judge erred by treating the appellant’s
    failure to confess to the crime as an aggravating factor.  While her late
    confession may have had an impact on the extent to which the sentencing judge
    was prepared to consider the guilty plea as a mitigating factor, I fail to
    see how the failure to immediately confess to the assault could amount to
    an aggravating factor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    am not persuaded, however, that these errors had any meaningful impact upon
    the sentence that was imposed, and even if they did, I would not interfere
    with the sentence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    have already explained the importance of deterrence, denunciation and community
    protection in the circumstances of this case.  When these factors and the
    gravity of the crime are considered alongside what is, at best, an ambivalent
    reaction from the appellant’s community regarding her sentence, in my view
    it is clear that a custodial sentence was appropriate. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    with the benefit of hindsight, it seems to me that we can now say with some
    confidence that in this case, the system has worked.  The appellant is to
    be commended for the progress she made while in custody.  Since receiving
    parole, she has returned to her community in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Sachigo
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Lake.  It is noteworthy that in light of her return, the <i>Gladue</i> report
    makes no further sentencing recommendations. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor
    would I interfere with the probation conditions, which have been adopted
    in the appellant’s parole conditions.  These conditions prevent her from
    having contact with children under 12 unless accompanied by a responsible
    adult and prohibit her from consuming alcohol.  Given the nature of the offence,
    the fact that it involved a young child, and the fact that the appellant
    is residing in a remote dry community, I am not persuaded that the sentencing
    judge erred in imposing these conditions.</p>
  <h3>Conclusion</h3>

    these reasons, I would grant leave to appeal the sentence but I would dismiss
    the appeal.  </p>
