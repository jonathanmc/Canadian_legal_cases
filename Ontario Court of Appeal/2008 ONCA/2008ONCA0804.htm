  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:

    appellant wrote and posted a “poem” on five mail and newspaper boxes in his
    neighbourhood.  The poem was about the appellant’s city councillor, Pat Saito.  The
    poem came to the attention of Pat Saito, who brought it to the attention
    of the police.  The appellant was charged with uttering a threat to cause
    death and intimidation.  He was convicted of uttering a death threat after
    a two-day trial. The charge of intimidation was stayed pursuant to the <i>Kienapple </i>principle.   By
    way of sentence, the appellant received a conditional discharge, subject
    to a 12-month term of probation.  The appellant appeals his conviction.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, for the reasons that follow, this appeal must succeed.  While the
    trial judge made no error in excluding the expert evidence tendered by the
    defence, he did err in finding that a reasonable person, looking at the poem
    objectively, and informed of all the circumstances, could conclude that the
    questioned words conveyed a threat of death.  As amateurish, foolish and
    offensive as the poem was, absent this essential element, the appellant did
    not commit the crime of threatening death. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant, a retired labourer, was 73 years old at the time he wrote the
    poem.  Pat Saito, who was the subject of the poem, was his city councillor.  The
    appellant testified that he wrote the poem in frustration over Ms. Saito’s
    responses, and delayed responses, to his communications with her office.  Those
    communications, which began in 2003, initially included the appellant’s concerns
    about development issues in his community of Churchill Meadows in Mississauga.  The
    appellant also raised concerns about illegal parking.  On November 4, 2005
    the appellant wrote Ms. Saito again, this time about the fact that his property
    tax bill included taxes from 2001, a year when he did not own the property.  The
    appellant was unhappy that he could not reach Ms. Saito personally.  On one
    occasion, her office said that she was at home ill.  On another occasion,
    Ms. Saito’s office told the appellant that she was on vacation.  Although
    Ms. Saito’s staff drafted a response to the appellant’s complaint, as a result
    of computer error, the response was not mailed to the appellant.  Consequently,
    the appellant did not receive a written response to his November property
    tax concern until Ms. Saito’s letter of January 11, 2006.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>These
    circumstances left the appellant dissatisfied with the councillor’s performance
    of her duties.  The appellant had earlier read a newspaper article that reported
    that the councillor had jokingly suggested that potholes could serve the
    purpose of slowing traffic.  It was this reference to potholes that provided
    the appellant with the idea for his poems.  On January 2, 2006, he sent other
    members of city council, but not Ms. Saito, an anonymous poem that was not
    the subject of any charges.  That poem read:</p>

    off-duty parking enforcement officer, who saw the poem posted on his community
    mailbox, brought it to the attention of Pat Saito’s office.  Pat Saito’s
    office brought the poem to the attention of the police.  As a result of his
    earlier correspondence with Pat Saito’s office, the appellant was interviewed.  Although,
    he initially denied authorship, he offered the view that the writer would
    have intended the poem to be in fun.  Later in the interview, the appellant
    admitted his authorship.  The appellant gave evidence that it was never his
    intention to threaten, frighten, or intimidate Ms. Saito, but simply to express
    his view to his community that the councillor was not doing her job as their
    elected representative.  His stated purpose in posting the poem was to bring
    his frustration to Ms. Saito’s attention to influence her to perform her
    job better. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE TRIAL JUDGE’S REASONS </span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='font-family:Times;'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-family:Times;'>In
      his reasons, the trial judge noted the appellant’s denial of any intention
      to threaten Ms. Saito with the posting of the poem.  He acknowledged the
      defence position that the poem was “satire, intended to be in jest”.  He
      considered the defence request to tender an expert opinion to assist the
      court in understanding “satire” as a means of expression in which words
      are not meant to be taken literally, but are written to ridicule the subject’s
      vices or failings.  The trial judge concluded that the expert opinion was
      not necessary to assist the court with determining whether an objective
      reasonable person could consider the poem a threat or with whether the
      appellant intended the threat to be taken seriously.  Thus, he excluded
      the opinion.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='font-family:Times;'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-family:Times;'>The
      trial judge considered the individual reactions of those who read the poem,
      as well as the appellant’s initial denial of authorship.  The trial judge
      rejected the appellant’s evidence that he posted the poem because he was
      shy about going door-to-door to speak with his neighbours about his concerns.  The
      trial judge also concluded that the appellant harboured a long-standing
      animus towards the councillor.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='font-family:Times;'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-family:Times;'>The
      trial judge dealt with the defence’s freedom of expression argument by
      observing that a threat is not protected by s. 2(b) of the <i>Charter</i> simply
      because the councillor was an elected figure.  For this reason, he concluded
      that s. 2(b) was irrelevant.  The trial judge then reviewed the last three
      stanzas of the poem “through the eyes of a reasonable person.”  The trial
      judge considered the author’s use in those stanzas of the first-person
      plural, his reference to dimensions similar to those of a grave, and his
      choice of words such as “soul” and “Heaven”.  Based on those references,
      the posting of the poem, the appellant’s lack of understanding of the word “satire”,
      and a finding with respect to the appellant’s pre-existing relationship
      with the councillor, the trial judge concluded that the offending stanzas
      constituted a threat.  The trial judge characterized the appellant’s evidence
      and arguments denying an intention to threaten as not supporting a “defence
      that the words were written in jest”.  In finding the accused guilty of
      uttering a threat to cause death, the trial judge held that the “actions
      of the accused crossed the line from permissible political comment to prohibited
      criminal conduct”.</span></p>

normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant argues that the trial judge erred in finding that a reasonable
    person would view the poem as a threat because he failed to consider, or
    to consider properly, the context in which it was written and refused to
    admit expert evidence to assist him with this issue.  He also argues that
    the trial judge erred in his analysis of the necessary <i>mens rea</i> for
    the offence, and in his finding that s. 2(b) of the <i>Charter</i> was not

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The question to be resolved may be put in the following
    way.  <i>Looked at objectively, in the context of all the words written or

      that the poem was made in jest or in such a way that it could not be taken
      seriously.  </span>As Cory J. said in <i>Clemente</i> at p. 762, “it is
      the meaning conveyed by the words that is important.&nbsp; Yet it cannot

    Instructions</i> (
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto: Thomson Canada Limited, 2005), at p. 507, which I summarize.  First,
    the Crown must establish that the appellant made a threat <span style='"Times New Roman";color:black'>to
    cause the councillor’s death; </span>and second, that he made the threat
    knowing that it would be taken seriously.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To
    satisfy the first element, the Crown is required to prove that, when viewed
    objectively, <span style='color:black'>an ordinary reasonable person would
    consider the appellant’s poem amounted to a threat to cause Ms. Saito’s death.  In
    considering whether a threat was made, the ordinary reasonable person would
    take into account all the circumstances, including the manner in which the
    words were communicated, the audience to whom it was addressed and the relationship
    between the writer and the subject of the alleged threat.  </span></p>

    determination of whether the poem constitutes a threat in law requires a
    reasonable person to consider the context or circumstances in which it was
    made.  Before arriving at a conclusion whether the impugned words or gestures
    constitute a threat, a court must consider all the circumstances both individually,
    and as a whole.  </p>

    of the legal test for a threat, I turn to the context of the appellant’s
    poem, including the context of the <i>Criminal Code’s</i> purpose of protecting

    considering whether the questioned words constitute a threat, the reasonable
    person would consider all the circumstances.  The circumstances relied upon
    in this case include the perception of threat by the witnesses, the context
    of the relationship between the appellant and the councillor, the questioned
    words in the light of the appellant’s poem as a whole, the manner in which
    the poem was distributed and its character as political commentary.  I will
    consider each of these circumstances in turn and then as a whole to inform

  <h3><i><span lang=EN-US>(a)   The Reasonable Person</span></i></h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>An
    ordinary reasonable person considering an alleged threat objectively would
    be one informed of all the circumstances relevant to his or her determination.  The
    characteristics of a reasonable person were considered by the Supreme Court
    of Canada in <i>R. v. S. (R.D.)</i>, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 484, in the context
    of the test for bias.  In that case, L’Heureux-Dubé and McLachlin JJ., at
    para. 36,  described such a person as a:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>reasonable, informed, practical and realistic person
    who considers the matter in some detail.…The person postulated is not a
    “very sensitive or scrupulous” person, but rather a right-minded person familiar
    with the circumstances of the case.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>Similarly, in <i>R. v. Collins</i>,
    [1987] 1 S.C.R. 265, at p. 282, in the context of the test for bringing the
    administration of justice into disrepute, Lamer J. for the majority describes
    a reasonable person as “dispassionate and fully apprised of the circumstances
    of the case”: see also <i>R. v. Burlingham</i>, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 206, at para.
    71.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    follows that a reasonable person considering whether the impugned words amount
    to a threat at law is one who is objective, fully-informed, right-minded,
    dispassionate, practical and realistic.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To
    support a conclusion that an ordinary reasonable person would have found
    the appellant’s poem threatening, the Crown relies on the testimony of the
    parking enforcement officer, the investigating police officer and Ms. Saito
    concerning their reactions to the poem.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, while the opinions of the three witnesses may have been relevant,
    their evidence could not be determinative because their evidence amounted
    to a personal opinion that did not necessarily satisfy the requirements of
    the legal test.  As the Supreme Court of Canada stated in <i>McCraw, </i>whether
    the impugned words amount to a threat is a question of law.  None of the
    witnesses applied the legal test that asks whether a reasonable person, fully
    informed of the circumstances, considering the matter objectively, would
    consider the impugned words as a threat, nor were they asked to do so.  In
    this case, neither the enforcement officer nor the police officer considered
    the poem in the light of all the circumstances.  While Ms. Saito may have
    been distressed by the poem, her view was subjective rather than objective.  The
    perspective of the reasonable person is different from that of the three
    witnesses relied upon by the Crown.  </p>
  <h3><i>(b)    The Context of the Relationship</i></h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    reasonable person would consider the context of the relationship between
    the author and the subject of the poem as important to a determination of
    whether it constitutes a threat.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    relationship between the appellant and Ms. Saito was obviously based upon
    the requests and complaints made by a constituent to his municipal councillor.  From
    the subjective perspective of the appellant, the relationship was unsatisfactory.  The
    councillor’s office had been unresponsive or slow to respond to his inquiries
    and, in his view, the councillor was inexplicably distracted from her job
    by the potholes, an issue she apparently approached light-heartedly.  From
    the councillor’s perspective, the relationship was satisfactory because,
    to the best of the councillor’s knowledge at the time, her office responded
    to the constituent’s concerns, albeit latterly with some delay.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown concedes that the trial judge erred in his factual findings regarding
    the relationship between the appellant and the councillor.  The trial judge
    found that the relationship caused Ms. Saito concern prior to her receipt
    of the poem.  However, while Ms. Saito testified that she found the poem
    threatening, she did not link that concern to her pre-existing relationship
    with the appellant.  The Crown describes this error as peripheral; however,
    in my view, the error is significant.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    relationship between the appellant and the councillor provides context to
    whether the Crown satisfied the legal test that the poem constituted a threat.  Even
    though the appellant had been complaining to the councillor over a prolonged
    period of time, nothing about the previous complaints, including the previous
    poem, caused the councillor to feel threatened.  The factual finding to the
    contrary takes on particular significance because it immediately precedes
    the trial judge’s conclusion “that the words written constitute a threat.”  </p>
  <h3><i>(c) The Structure of the Poem </i></h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge’s reasons do not reflect a consideration of the impugned stanzas
    of the poem in the context of the poem as a whole, or in the context of the
    appellant’s earlier poem.  Instead, the reasons appear to consider the impugned
    stanzas in isolation, separate from the context of the mocking tone and cadence – albeit
    inelegant and rudimentary – that are evident in the earlier stanzas.  Like
    the first poem, the first stanzas are replete with attempts to rhyme or mimic
    nursery rhymes.  The first stanzas highlight the author’s perception of the
    councillor’s interest or preoccupation with potholes, rather than with fulfilling
    the obligations of her job.  This approach is further confirmed by the title “Parked
    Cars and pot holes in the City of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Mississauga”.  As poorly written as the appellant’s poem is, the earlier
    stanzas cannot but diminish what might otherwise be seen as an implicit threat
    if the later stanzas were read in isolation.  It was incumbent on the trial
    judge to situate the later stanzas in this broader context of the poem as
    a whole and the earlier poem and to consider whether the author’s purpose
    may have been to mock the councillor for concentrating her efforts on potholes
    at the expense of other issues important to her constituents.  </p>
  <h3><i>(d)   The Context of Posting the Poem</i></h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    addition, while the trial judge considered the fact that the poem was posted
    publicly, he did so primarily regarding the appellant’s intention and whether
    the appellant could have instead gone door-to-door to discuss the councillor’s
    job performance with his neighbours.  On this issue, the appellant testified
    that he did not go door-to-door because he was shy.  While there was ample
    evidence - especially the appellant’s difficulties with the English language – to
    support the appellant’s explanation, it was open to the trial judge to reject
    it as he did.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    it is also important on the question of the <i>actus
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    reus</i> of the offence that the appellant did not surreptitiously or otherwise
    send the poem to Ms. Saito.  Had the appellant done so, the last stanzas
    of the poem may have seemed more ominous to the informed person.  By instead
    posting the poem in public areas on neighbourhood mailboxes, the appellant
    could be seen as engaging the community in the political process, rather
    than directing a threat against Ms. Saito.  It is also noteworthy that certain
    characteristics of the poem permitted the police to easily identify the appellant
    as its author.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>These
    perspectives of the public posting were not considered by the trial judge
    in his reasons.  Such conduct would belie the Crown’s position that the “threat” in
    the poem was meant to be taken seriously.</p>
  <h3><i>(e)  The Context of Freedom of Expression</i></h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant argues that the trial judge failed to consider s. 2(b) of the <i>Charter </i>in
    considering the context of the appellant’s poem.  Section 2(b) provides that
    everyone has fundamental freedoms, including “freedom of thought, belief,
    opinion and expression”.  The trial judge concluded that the <i>Charter</i> was
    not engaged because s. 2(b) does not operate to protect a threat on the basis
    that the threat was made to a public figure.  This conclusion is correct.  However,
    it also can be read, as argued by the appellant, to presuppose the answer
    to the question at issue: whether the poem constituted a threat.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant’s argument, distilled on appeal, is not that s. 2(b) applies to
    protect threats to public representatives.  Rather, the appellant argues
    that whether the appellant’s poem constitutes a threat has to be decided
    in the light of the s. 2(b) right to freedom of expression, particularly
    freedom of expression in a political context.  In other words, the fundamental
    right of freedom of expression is a factor relevant to the determination
    of whether the statement constituted a threat just as is the fundamental
    right to freedom of choice and action protected by the criminalization of
    threats.  Both freedoms must be considered and balanced.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown concedes that the right to freedom of expression is a fundamental value
    in a free and democratic society.  That right, discussion of which long pre-dates
    s. 2(b), is of particular importance in the political context where freedom
    of expression, even offensive expression, functions to ensure open debate
    and equal participation in the political process: see <i>R. v. Sharpe</i>,
    [2001] 1 S.C.R. 45, at para. 21.  In <i>R. v. Keegstra</i>, [1990] 3 S.C.R.
    697, at p. 727, Dickson C.J., writing for the majority, referenced the certain “convictions
    fuelling the freedom of expression”, including, at p. 728, the conviction
    that “participation in social and political decision-making is to be fostered
    and encouraged”.  At pp. 763-64, the court explained:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The connection between freedom of expression and
    the political process is perhaps the linchpin of the s. 2(<i>b</i>) guarantee,
    and the nature of this connection is largely derived from the Canadian commitment
    to democracy.  Freedom of expression is a crucial aspect of the democratic
    commitment, not merely because it permits the best policies to be chosen
    from among a wide array of proffered options, but additionally because it
    helps to ensure that participation in the political process is open to all
    persons.  Such open participation must involve to a substantial degree the
    notion that all persons are equally deserving of respect and dignity.  The
    state therefore cannot act to hinder or condemn a political view without
    to some extent harming the openness of Canadian democracy and its associated
    tenet of equality for all.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>These concepts are central to the
    tenets of a democracy.</p>

    in circumstances where s. 2(b) has no direct application, such as in this
    case, nonetheless its fundamental values can operate as a relevant consideration.  In <i>R.W.D.S.U.,
    Local 558 v. Pepsi-Cola
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    Beverages (West) Ltd.</i>, [2002] 1 S.C<i>.</i>R<i>. </i>156, the Supreme
    Court of Canada, at para. 20, confirmed freedom of expression as a “fundamental
    Canadian value” that is expressed in the <i>Charter</i>, but that also informs
    the common law.<i>  Pepsi-Cola</i>, also at para. 20, quotes McIntyre J.’s
    observation in<i> RWDSU v. Dolphin Delivery Ltd.</i>, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 573,
    at p. 583, that “[f]reedom of expression is not, however, a creature of the <i>Charter</i>.  It
    is one of the fundamental concepts that has formed the basis for the historical
    development of the political, social and educational institutions of western
    society.”  See also pp. 584-86 of <i>Dolphin Delivery</i>; <i>Boucher v.
    The King</i>, [1951] S.C.R. 265, at p. 288; <i>Switzman v. Elbling</i>, [1957]

    references in the trial judge’s reasons show he was alive to the constituent/elected
    representative relationship between the appellant and Ms. Saito.  However,
    those references do not consider the poem in the context of the importance
    of freedom of expression in the form of political commentary.  In my view,
    the trial judge’s conclusory statement that the “accused crossed the line
    from permissible political comment to prohibited criminal conduct” is insufficient
    to demonstrate a consideration of this context.  Nowhere do the trial judge’s
    reasons address the poem as political commentary or make reference to the
    appellant’s imagery concerning the councillor’s chances of winning an election “race”.</p>

    poem’s purpose of denigrating the elected councillor’s level of job commitment
    or competence provides important context for a consideration of whether the
    impugned stanzas of the poem constitute a threat.  All citizens are entitled
    to freedom of expression in the political forum, including those whose language
    skills are limited.  While it was unnecessary for the trial judge to engage
    in the in-depth s. 2(b) analysis urged upon him by trial counsel, it was
    necessary to consider the poem as political commentary before determining
    whether it constituted a threat at law.</p>

    my view, considering all the above circumstances individually and as a whole,
    the trial judge’s conclusion that the offending stanzas constituted a threat
    cannot be sustained particularly in the light of the factual error concerning
    the councillor’s pre-existing relationship with the appellant, the political
    context in which the poem was written, its public dissemination, and the
    context of the stanzas in the poem and in the context of the earlier poem.</p>

    it is unnecessary to consider the appellant’s arguments that the trial judge
    also erred regarding the second element of the appellant’s intention.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>3. Was the Verdict
      Unreasonable?</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:

    the three offending stanzas, if viewed in isolation, <i>could</i> be interpreted
    as a threat, that is not the test.  The test requires the stanzas to be viewed
    objectively, in context and by the reasonable person.  The reasonable person
    would be informed about all the circumstances, including that the “poem” was
    written by an elderly retired man who was not proficient in the English language
    and who had the benefit of only three years of education.  He or she would
    also know that the appellant was frustrated by his perception that his councillor
    did not respond promptly or satisfactorily to his concerns, but that the
    author had never before given any indication that he would act on his concerns
    other than in the political context.  The reasonable person would know that
    the appellant did not send this poem to the councillor, but posted it publicly
    for the stated purpose of public discourse in a way that the author could
    be easily identified.  He or she would also know that the appellant denied
    that he intended to threaten the councillor with death, but stated that he
    intended only to argue that she should stop focusing on potholes and instead
    focus on doing her job.  The informed reasonable person would also be cognizant
    of the right of ordinary citizens to criticize and ridicule their elected
    representatives.  The test posited in <i>McCraw </i>asks whether, “[l]ooked
    at objectively, in the context of all the words written or spoken and having
    regard to the person to whom they were directed, … the questioned words convey
    a threat of serious bodily harm to a reasonable person”.  In my view, in
    the light of the entire context, no reasonable person, fully informed, could
    interpret the appellant’s poem as a threat that could be taken seriously.  No
    matter how misguided, offensive, and badly written the poem, the words at
    issue cannot meet the legal definition of a threat.  The appellant is therefore
    entitled to a verdict of not guilty. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>4. Expert Evidence</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:

    in view of this conclusion, it is unnecessary to deal with the appellant’s
    challenge to the trial judge’s decision to exclude the defence expert opinion,
    I will consider the issue briefly since it was a central argument of the
    appellant’s case. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    expert opinion of Professor Duffy, a qualified English scholar, was tendered
    at trial by the appellant on the basis that, without an academic understanding
    of satire, the trial judge could not understand a reasonable person’s view
    of the meaning and intent of the poem.  I would reject the appellant’s argument
    that the trial judge erred in the exercise of his discretion to exclude the
    proposed expert opinion.  As the appellant concedes, the trial judge correctly
    identified the test set out in <i>R. v. Mohan</i>, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 9.  It
    was open to the trial judge to conclude that the expert opinion was not necessary
    to assist him in determining whether an ordinary reasonable person, informed
    of all the circumstances, would construe the poem as a threat to cause death
    or in deciding whether the appellant posted the poem with the intention that
    it be taken seriously.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    addition, the trial judge’s description of Dr. Duffy’s opinion as not scientific
    was simply responsive to a submission of the appellant’s counsel in the <i>voir
    dire</i> and did not demonstrate an error in his approach to the admissibility
    of expert evidence.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    charge of intimidation included the same element of death threats.  For the
    same reasons, it also cannot succeed.  Accordingly, I would allow the appeal,
    set aside the conviction and substitute an acquittal of the appellant on
    both counts in the indictment.  </p>
