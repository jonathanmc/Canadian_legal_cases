  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    October 25, 2004, several police officers arrived at the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Mississauga home of Gus Papadopoulos to execute a search warrant.  Under
    the warrant, police were seeking several items, including articles of clothing
    and things used by Clifford Dean Williams in a series of eight robberies
    that had taken place in Peel Region from early June to late September of
    that same year.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    police were about to enter or were entering the house, the appellant, who
    rented a room there, attempted to obstruct their entry.  He was apprehended
    by the officers and handcuffed.  An officer noticed an obvious bulge in one
    of the appellant’s front pants pockets.  A search revealed a cell phone and
    some crack cocaine in individually wrapped  pieces.  In another pocket, the
    appellant had a roll of cash.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    the execution of the search warrant, officers entered an upstairs bedroom.
    In a small unlocked safe sitting in plain view on a chair, they found a set
    of scales, two clear baggies apparently containing crack cocaine, a set of
    car keys that fit a motor vehicle in the driveway and an
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ohio driver’s licence in the appellant’s name. The car in the driveway, it
    was acknowledged, belonged to the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was charged with possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking.  A
    jury convicted him of the offence charged.  The trial judge imposed a sentence
    of two years imprisonment to be served in the community.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant asserts that his conviction is flawed because the trial judge admitted
    evidence that had been obtained by constitutional infringement and further,
    that the trial judge failed to properly instruct the jury in one respect
    critical to the defence position at the trial. We would not give effect to
    either of the appellant’s complaints. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>            A.        The Evidentiary
      Rulings</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complaint about the erroneous reception of  evidence comes up in this way.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the outset of trial proceedings, the appellant challenged the validity of
    the search warrant that the police were executing when they came into contact
    with the appellant at the front door of the residence to be searched.  The
    complaint was that the information to obtain the warrant (ITO) contained
    false information about material facts and, had the true facts been disclosed
    to the issuing justice, the warrant could not have been issued.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge concluded that the ITO contained two false statements. Those
    statements related to the likelihood that certain things involved in the
    robberies would still be at the premises where the search was to be conducted
    a month after the last robbery, and to the clothing Williams is said to have
    worn during the robberies.  The trial judge concluded that the informant
    did not intend to present false evidence or to mislead the issuing justice.  This
    finding was open to the trial judge on the evidence before her.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is worth observation that the informant had two sources of information about
    the likelihood of items linking Williams to the robberies remaining at the
    premises to be searched although Williams no longer lived there: Williams
    and his girlfriend, Kelly Lynn Holmes.  While it was wrong to attribute to
    Williams a statement that certain items remained at the premises to be searched,
    Holmes provided information that certain items should still be there, and
    that Williams in fact had been back to the residence during the previous
    two weeks.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    informant was also in error, as the trial judge found, in attributing to
    Williams an acknowledgement that he was clad in black clothing during the
    robberies.  Williams denied such a uniform.  However, Williams’
    denial was contradicted by video surveillance at some of the premises robbed
    and by information provided to investigators by Holmes and by another person,
    William Cowell, to whom Williams had spoken about and described the black
    clothing that he (Williams) had worn during the robberies.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant acknowledges that the trial judge applied the proper standard in
    determining whether, setting to one side the misleading information, the
    warrant could nonetheless have been granted.  In essence, the complaint reduces
    to a quarrel with the findings of fact made by the trial judge.  According
    to the appellant, the trial judge should have found deliberate deception
    and an intention to mislead, rather than an inadvertent error.  But the findings
    made do not reflect any misapprehension of the evidence adduced or the application
    of any improper principle or other error; rather, they are firmly rooted
    in the evidence adduced on the s. 8 <i>Charter</i> application.  We would
    not give effect to this ground of appeal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    follows that the officers who attended the Papadopoulos’
    residence were lawfully present in the execution of a valid search warrant,
    which authorized the search of the entire premises. They were further entitled
    to detain and search the appellant at the entrance to the premises as a person
    who appeared to be obstructing the execution of the warrant. No discrete
    complaint is made about that search and seizure.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>            B.        Jury
      Instructions</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant next says that the trial judge’s final instructions to the jury
    were flawed in a single respect: the instructions failed to adequately put
    to the jury the defence position on the effect of the absence of any complaint
    by the appellant and the homeowner about police misconduct on their credibility
    as witnesses and the reliability of their evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant and Papadopoulos, the owner of the searched premises, gave evidence
    about physically abusive conduct by various members of the Peel Regional
    Police Service during the execution of the search warrant and the arrest
    of the appellant.  Each was cross-examined about his failure to file or otherwise
    make any complaint to any official about their allegations of police misconduct.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the pre-charge conference, the appellant’s trial counsel sought an instruction
    that the absence of complaint was of little or no weight as a factor in the
    jury’s decision about the credibility of the defence witnesses and the reliability
    of their evidence. Crown counsel at trial offered a draft instruction to
    the trial judge.  The appellant’s trial counsel responded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>And it’s fine with me, Your Honour.  I would like
    maybe to add something, less legalese and more generic. That’s all.  …</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    her final instructions, the trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In your deliberations you will also
    need to consider the testimony of Mr. Osanyinlusi and Mr. Papadopoulos about
    how the events unfolded that day, both of whose evidence is  markedly different
    from that of the officers.  Consider the consistencies or inconsistencies
    in their evidence also in the context of the evidence as a whole.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>You should also assess evidence given
    on cross-examination by the various witnesses.  For example, you heard the
    evidence of missed procedures, of no fingerprints being taken, and the evidence
    about Detective Andrews’ involvement having not been disclosed during the
    preliminary inquiry.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>As always, when you consider these
    challenges to the evidence, it is up to you how much or how little weight
    you give to the evidence in making your decision.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>As another example, you also heard
    the Crown on cross-examination question the evidence of the severe police
    brutality taking place in the presence of numerous civilian witnesses. Though
    the evidence that no complaints were made by these witnesses about police
    brutality is not necessarily proof of the fact that no abuse occurred, the
    weight that you give to this, or any of the evidence you have heard, is up
    to you.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    discussing the position of the defence, the trial judge added:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The defence submits that Mr. Osanyinlusi
    and Mr. Papadopoulos’s evidence of events about police brutality that evening
    is entirely reasonable in the circumstances of this case where the police
    power was exerted against them in this overwhelming manner.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>She submits no weight should be given
    to the evidence that they made no police complaints given their circumstances.  She
    challenges the credibility and reliability of the officers’
    testimony, and asks you to consider how unlikely it would be that someone  would
    leave crack cocaine in an open safe, and walk out of a house inhabited by
    known crack cocaine addicts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the final instructions adequately apprised the jurors of the relevance
    of the absence of formal complaint about police misconduct to their assessment
    of the credibility of the appellant<span
lang=EN-US>’s</span> and Papadopoulos’s evidence. As the trial judge properly
    pointed out, it was for the jury to determine the effect, if any, of the
    absence of complaint on the credibility of the defence witnesses and the
    reliability of their evidence. And that was the way the trial judge left
    it with the jury, coupled with a faithful recounting of the defence position
    on the issue.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s trial counsel did not object to the trial judge’s handling of
    this issue in her final instructions, either in the manner in which the trial
    judge instructed the jury about the use it could make of the absence of complaint,
    the position of the defence on the issue, or for a failure to recite the
    witnesses’ explanation for their failure to complain.  We would not give
    effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
