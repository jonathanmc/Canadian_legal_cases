  <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    appeal addresses the question of whether a trade union may invoke the jurisdiction
    of the court to enforce fines that it has imposed against its members for
    crossing a picket line.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondents, Jeffrey Birch and April Luberti, were fined by the appellant
    union for crossing the picket line to attend work during a legal strike.  In
    an application to the Superior Court of Justice, Justice Robert Smith held
    that a provision in the appellant’s constitution authorizing the fines was
    an unenforceable penalty clause.  The appellant appeals that finding.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h2>FACTS</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    parties proceeded on an agreed statement of facts in the Superior Court of
    Justice.  Mr. Birch and Ms. Luberti, employees of the Canada Revenue Agency,
    crossed a picket line to attend work on three days during a legal strike
    by the Public Service Alliance of Canada (“PSAC”) in the fall of 2004.  Mr.
    Birch and Ms. Luberti were members of the appellant, the Union of Taxation
    Employees (“UTE”), a component of PSAC (UTE and PSAC are referred to from
    time to time as “the union”).  The UTE brought disciplinary proceedings against
    Mr. Birch and Ms. Luberti for violating the PSAC constitution by working
    during a legal strike.  The union suspended the membership of Mr. Birch and
    Ms. Luberti for three years (one year for each day that they crossed the
    picket line).  The union also fined each member $476.75.  The fine was equivalent
    to the total of each employee’s gross salary for the three days they crossed
    the picket line.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    relevant provisions of the PSAC constitution under which Mr. Birch and Ms.
    Luberti were fined are the following:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Section 25(5)(n)</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A PSAC Regional Council, Component, Local, Area
    Council officer or member, is guilty of an offense against this constitution
    who: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(n)       is a worker in a legal strike position,
    who either crosses the picket line or is paid by the employer not to participate
    in strike action, or performs work for the employer, unless required to do
    so by law, or who voluntarily performs struck work;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Section 25(3)</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Any disciplinary action taken under the provisions
    of Sub-Sections (1) and (2) of this Section for a cause listed in Sub-Section
    (5)(n) of this Section shall include the imposition of a fine that equals
    the amount of daily remuneration earned by the member, multiplied by the
    number of days that the member crossed the picket line, performed work for
    the employer or voluntarily performed struck work.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Birch, Ms. Luberti and a number of other employees, who had been fined for
    crossing the picket line, refused to pay their fines.  UTE sought to enforce
    the payment of the fines in the Small Claims Division of the Superior Court
    of Justice.  The parties agreed that this matter should proceed by way of
    application brought by Mr. Birch and Ms. Luberti in the Superior Court on
    an agreed statement of facts as a test case.  Mr. Birch and Ms. Luberti sought
    the following relief in their application:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>a.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    Declaration that the Superior Court of Justice of the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Province of
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Ontario does not have the jurisdiction to enforce provisions set out in the
    constitution of a trade union that provide for fines/financial penalties
    against the trade union’s members;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>b.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the alternative, a Declaration that the Superior Court of Justice of the
    Province of Ontario does not have the jurisdiction to enforce the fine/financial
    penalty provisions as set out in the Constitution of the Public Service Alliance
    of Canada (“PSAC”) and/or the By-Laws of the Union of Taxation Employees
    (“UTE”) (referred to collectively as the “Union”);</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>c.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>An
    order dismissing claims brought by the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    Union against the Applicants in the Small  Claims Branch of the Superior
    Court of Justice[.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    application judge, in different wording, granted the relief sought by Mr.
    Birch and Ms. Luberti.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>UTE
    appeals the judgment of the application judge on the ground that he erred
    in failing to find that the penalty clause in the PSAC constitution was not
    unconscionable and therefore could be enforced.  UTE also asserts that Mr.
    Birch and Ms. Luberti should have appealed the fines under the provisions
    of the PSAC constitution and, if necessary, filed a complaint with the Public
    Service Labour Relations Board.  According to the union, the failure of Mr.
    Birch and Ms. Luberti to exercise their internal rights of appeal and statutory
    complaint to the Public Service Relations Board precludes them from asserting
    by way of defence in the Superior Court that the fines are unenforceable.</p>
  <h2>THE REASONS FOR JUDGMENT OF THE APPLICATION JUDGE</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    application judge addressed four issues:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Are
    Mr. Birch and Ms. Luberti entitled to defend in the Small Claims court?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Are
    the fines imposed on Mr. Birch and Ms. Luberti penalties levied under the
    union constitution and, if so, are they unenforceable by the court?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Are
    the fines imposed by the union enforceable because they are not unconscionable
    in the circum-stances?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(iv)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Are
    the fines imposed by the union and their enforce-ment by the court, authorized
    by statute?</p>
  <h2><i>(i)</i>        <i>Are Mr. Birch and Ms. Luberti entitled to defend in
      the Small
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Claims Court?</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    union member who has been disciplined may appeal the penalty imposed to a
    three person tribunal comprised of a representative of the member, a representative
    of the union and an independent person agreed to by both parties or appointed
    by a labour organization such as the Canadian Labour Congress.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Public Service Labour Relations Board has jurisdiction to hear complaints
    concerning disciplinary action taken by a union against a member under ss.
    188, 190 and 192 of the <i>Public Service Labour Relations Act</i>, S.C.
    2003, c. 22 as long as all internal appeals have been exhausted.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    union’s position before the application judge and in this court was that
    by failing to appeal their fines to a three member panel and then to file
    a complaint (if necessary) to the Public Service Labour Relations Board,
    Mr. Birch and Ms. Luberti lost their right to defend against the actions
    commenced in the Small Claims Court for the enforcement of the fines.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    application judge held that once the union had sued its members in the Small
    Claims Court the members were entitled to raise any defence open to them.  The
    application judge made reference to rule 25.07(4) of the <i>Rules of Civil
    Procedure</i>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194 relating to the pleading of defences
    and to rule 25.06(2) concerning the pleading of points of law.  The application
    judge observed that the union had not provided him with any authority in
    support of its position that he should deprive a defendant in the Superior
    Court from pleading all possible defences available.</p>
  <h2><i>(ii)</i>       <i>Are the fines imposed on Mr. Birch and Ms. Luberti
      penalties imposed under the union constitution, and, if so, are they unenforceable
      by the court?</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    application judge concluded that the relationship between a trade union and
    its members is governed by the union constitution which is a contractual
    relationship.  See <i>Berry v. Pulley</i>, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 493 at para. 48:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>[T]he time has come to recognize formally that
    when a member joins a union, a relationship in the nature of a contract arises
    between the member and the trade union <u>as a legal entity</u>.  By the
    act of membership, both the union and the member agree to be bound by the
    terms of the union constitution, and an action may be brought by a member
    against the union for its breach[.]</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>The application judge held that
    the contract between the union and its members is a contract of adhesion
    as the members had no real bargaining power with the union: see
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place

    <i>Berry</i> at para. 49.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    application judge further held that, at common law, the courts will not enforce
    a penalty clause in a contract that does not provide a genuine pre-estimate
    of damages: see <i>Canadian General Electric Co. v. Canadian Rubber Co. of
    Montreal</i> (1915), 27 D.L.R. 294 (S.C.C.); <i>Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co.
    Ltd. v. New Garage and Motor Co. Ltd.</i> [1915] A.C. 79 (H.L.); <i>J.G.
    Collins Insurance Agencies Ltd. v. Elsley Estate</i>, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 916. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    application judge referred to <i>Peachtree</i> <i>II Associates – Dallas
    LP v. 857486 Ontario Ltd.</i> (2005), 76 O.R. (3d) 362 (C.A.) where Sharpe
    J.A. “declined to decide whether the equitable principles of unconscionability
    should be imported into the common law rule pertaining to the enforcement
    of penalty clauses”.  At para. 26, Sharpe J.A. said: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The central pillar of the appellant’s argument,
    as I understand it, is that there is an iron-clad rule to the effect that
    all stipulated remedy clauses, whether penalties or forfeitures, assessed
    at the date of the contract as having penal consequences will not be enforced.  In
    my view, that proposition does not represent an accurate statement of the
    law.  Not all stipulated remedy clauses having penal consequences are unenforceable.  In
    particular, the equitable doctrine of relief from forfeiture enforces such
    penalty clauses, where they are in the form of a forfeiture, where it is
    not unconscionable to do so.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    reviewing the above legal principles, the application judge concluded at
    para. 30 of his judgment:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I find that the plain and ordinary meaning of the
    words imposing a fine and taking disciplinary action is in fact to impose
    a penalty to dissuade Union members from crossing the picket line during
    a legal strike.  The purpose of the clause is clear and it is not related
    to making a genuine estimate of damages, but rather is intended to force
    members of the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    Union to follow the terms of the constitution by imposing a financial penalty
    if a member does do so.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span

    application judge found that the penalty clause was very unfair for the following
    reasons.  First, the application judge rejected the union’s principal submission
    that the penalty provision in the constitution was fair and reasonable because
    the amount of the fines imposed was trivial when compared with the damages
    caused to the union by the respondents crossing the picket line.  The union
    estimated the damages at $258.95 for each member – calculated on the basis
    of one cent per union member.  This submission was postulated on the theory
    that the respondents’ conduct in crossing the picket line caused a decrease
    in the benefits that the union was able to negotiate in the new collective
    agreement at the rate of one cent per member.  The application judge concluded
    that there was no evidence to support this theory.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    the union submitted that a fine equivalent to the members’ gross pay was
    not unfair because it would be difficult to determine a member’s net pay
    and, in any event, the fine represented the value of the work to the employer
    rather than the member.  The application judge rejected this argument and
    concluded that a fine based “on the value of the work to the employer does
    not justify or minimize its onerous effects on the … members who crossed
    the picket line or make the amount of the fine levied fair to the members
    who crossed the picket line.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third,
    the union also submitted that the fines were not unfair because they prevent
    free-loading by individual members of the union during the collective bargaining
    process.  The application judge concluded that the union had other means
    available to accomplish this end such as the waging of information campaigns
    and the setting of strike pay on a basis that would encourage support for
    the strike.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    application judge concluded that the respondents had satisfied him that the
    fines levied against the respondents were extremely onerous.  He said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The imposition of a hefty fine, at a time when members
    may already be suffering financially as a result of strike action supports
    the conclusions that the fine provisions are very unfair.   </p>

    issue as if there was no such concession.  The union does not concede the

    the Supreme Court of Canada in
    <st1:State

    do not include the imposition of fines for crossing a picket line during
    a legal strike.  The union therefore submitted that because there was no

    authorize the union to fine their members for crossing the picket line.  He

    Union relies upon the <i>obiter dicta</i> of Sharpe J.A. in <i>Peachtree
    II</i>.  <i>Peachtree II</i> involved two commercial contracts which contained
    identical stipulated remedy provisions that in the event of default certain
    promissory notes were deemed to be paid in full.  The respondents alleged
    default under the agreements before an arbitrator and sought a declaration
    deeming the promissory notes paid in full.  The arbitrator held that the
    stipulated remedy provision could be regarded as a penalty clause.  However,
    he upheld the clause and refused to grant the appellant relief from forfeiture.  On
    appeal to the Superior Court the appeal judge held that the respondent could
    enforce the clause even if it was a penalty.</p>

        relief from forfeiture</span></span>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'>Sharpe J.A. proceeded to decide the case on the basis of a request for relief
    from forfeiture and concluded at para. 36 of his reasons:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>My conclusion with respect to relief from forfeiture
    makes it unnecessary for me to consider the point dealt with by the appeal
    judge, namely, whether there is a residual discretion to enforce a payment

    the court in <i>Peachtree II</i> declined to decide the issue of whether
    a penalty clause in a contract remains <i>per se</i> unenforceable Sharpe
    J.A. did not leave much doubt concerning where the courts should head when
    squarely faced with this issue.  He said at para. 32 of his reasons:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Second, I agree with Professor Waddams’ observation
    in <i>The Law of Damages</i>, looseleaf (Aurora: Canada Law Book Inc., 1991)
    at para. 8.310 that as there is often little to distinguish between the two
    types of clauses and that there is much to be said for assimilating both
    under unconscionability.  The effect of assimilation would be “to provide
    a more rational framework for the decisions of both forfeitures and penalties”.  Unconscionability
    is also the direction suggested by the dictum of Dickson J. in <i>Elsley
    v. J.G. Collins Insurance Agencies Ltd.</i>, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 916, 83 D.L.R.
    (3d) 1, at p. 937 S.C.R.: “It is now evident that the power to strike down
    a penalty clause is a blatant interference with freedom of contract and is
    designed for the sole purpose of providing relief against oppression for
    the party having to pay the stipulated sum.”  As pointed out by the appeal
    judge, this would also appear to be the direction of s. 98 of the <i>Courts
    of Justice Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C43: “A court may grant relief against
    penalties and forfeitures, on such terms as to compensation or otherwise,
    as are considered just.”  All of this suggests to me that courts should,
    whenever possible, favour analysis on the basis of equitable principles and
    unconscionability over the strict common law rule pertaining to penalty clauses.</p>

    that the common law rule against penalty clauses still has some life, I would
    agree that this is not the case to make a sweeping pronouncement that the
    rule is no longer applicable to the law of contract generally.  The rule
    was developed through a wide spectrum of what might be described as typical
    commercial cases.  Whatever may be said of the facts of this case, it is
    not a typical commercial case and I would not wish to be taken as suggesting
    that what follows is intended to be general authority for sounding the death
    knell for the rule against penalty clauses.  Like Sharpe J.A. I am of the

    no reason to suggest that the law of unconscionability does not apply to
    these kinds of agreements.  Given the <i>obiter dicta</i> expressed by Sharpe
    J.A. in <i>Peachtree II</i>, it was understandable that the application judge
    hesitated to declare the rule against penalty clauses was no longer applicable.  In

    said:<i></i></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Where a claim is made that a bargain is unconscionable,
    it must be shown for success that there was inequality in the position of

    in <i>Fraser Jewellers (1982) Ltd. v. Dominion Electric Protection Co.</i> (1997),
    34 O.R. (3d) 1 noted that the inequality of bargaining power alone does not
    render a contract unconscionable or unenforceable.  Robins J.A. speaking
    for the court said at page 11:<i></i></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The trial judge was of the opinion that there was
    an inequality of bargaining position between the plaintiff, a small retailer,
    and the defendant, a large security protection firms, and treated this as
    militating in favour of striking the clause.  While I agree that such inequality
    is a relevant criterion, the fact that the parties may have different bargaining
    power does not in itself render an agreement unconscionable or unen-forceable.  Mere
    inequality of bargaining power does not entitle a party to repudiate an agreement.  The
    question is not whether there was an inequality of bargaining power.  Rather,
    the question is whether there was an abuse of the bargaining power.</p>

    one articulates the test for unconscionability, I am satisfied that it involves
    more than a finding of inequality of bargaining power between the parties
    to a contract.  Both the test adopted by the application judge in <i>Eckstein</i> and
    the test in <i>Harry</i> of the British Columbia Court of Appeal recognize
    that a determination of unconscionability involves a two-part analysis – a
    finding of inequality of bargaining power and a finding that the terms of
    an agreement have a high degree of unfairness.  I see little, if any, difference
    between a description of terms of a contract as “very unfair” or “substantially
    unfair”.  I am also of the view that
    “abuse of the bargaining power” identified by Robins J.A. in <i>Fraser Jewellers</i> is

    next issue, before turning to the application judge’s conclusion, is the
    standard of appellate review.  McLachlin J.A. (as she then was) in <i>Principal
    Investments Ltd. v. Thiele Estate</i> (1987), 37 D.L.R. (4<span style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";'>th</span>)
    398 (B.C.C.A.) at page 402 concluded that a finding of unconscionability
    is a question of mixed fact and law:<i></i></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The question of unconscionability is one of mixed
    fact and law.  The trial judge’s conclusions as to the events which occurred
    are questions of fact with which this Court may interfere only if clear and
    overriding error is established: <i>Stein et al v. The Ship “Kathy K” et
    al</i> (1975), 62 D.L. R. (3d) 1, [1976] 2 S.C.R. 802, 6 N.R. 359; <i>Beaudoin-Daigneault
    v. Richard et al</i>, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 2 at p. 8, 37 R.F.L. (2d) 225, 57 N.R.
    288.  On the other hand, determination of whether the established facts support
    a conclusion of unconscionability on the applicable legal principles is primarily
    a question of law, with which this Court can interfere if it finds the conclusion
    to be wrong.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>In the much cited case of the Supreme
    Court of Canada in <i>Housen v. Nikolaisen</i>, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235 at para.
    36, the majority said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Matters of mixed fact and law lie along a spectrum.  Where,
    for instance, an error with respect to a finding of negligence can be attributed
    to the application of an incorrect standard, a failure to consider a required
    element of a legal test, or similar error in principle, such an error can
    be characterized as an error of law, subject to a standard of correctness.  Appellate
    courts must be cautious, however, in finding that a trial judge erred in
    law in his or her determination of negligence, as it is often difficult to
    extricate the legal questions from the factual.  It is for this reason that
    these matters are referred to as questions of “mixed law and fact”.  Where
    the legal principle is not readily extricable, then the matter is one of “mixed
    law and fact” and is subject to a more stringent standard.  The general rule,
    as stated in <i>Jaegli Enterprises, supra,</i> is that, where the issue on
    appeal involves the trial judge’s interpretation of the evidence as a whole,
    it should not be overturned absent palpable and overriding error.</p>

    on the strict language of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in <i>Harry</i>,
    he argues that the inequality of bargaining power must be linked with some “ignorance,
    need or distress” of the weaker party.  Counsel suggests that inequality
    of bargaining power can result from old age, emotional distress, dependence,
    lack of business experience, or poverty.  Counsel further submits that there
    is no evidence that such factors exist in this case.  I do not accept this
    submission.  There is no fixed set of criteria that establishes inequality

    power with the union.  Iacobucci J. also concluded that it is when the contract
    is formed that determines whether there was inequality of bargaining power.  When
    Mr. Birch and Ms. Luberti joined the union, they took the union constitution

    became members.  The fact that they could recommend and lobby for change
    after becoming members does not alter the analysis.<i></i></p>

    turn to the question of whether the application judge erred in finding that
    the fines levied against the respondents as provided for in the union constitution
    were “very unfair”.  As I read the reasons for judgment, the application
    judge considered all of the facts relevant to this issue.  <i></i></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    application judge determined that there was no evidence to support the union’s
    position that the fines were proportional to the damage suffered by the union
    as a result of Mr. Birch and Ms. Luberti crossing the picket line.  Before
    the application judge, the union sought to justify the fines as a genuine
    pre-estimate of the damages suffered by the union.  Although there was no
    evidence to support this position, the union submitted that the damages amounted
    to one cent per member which produced an amount of $258.95 for the total
    union membership of 25,895.  If $50 per day strike pay (for a total of $150.00)
    is subtracted from that amount, the total amount of the damages would be
    reduced to $108.95.  The actual amount of the fine was $476.75 or 454 per
    cent greater than the union’s estimate of its damages less the $150.00 for
    strike pay.  I agree with the application judge that a fine of that magnitude
    can properly be described as excessive and unconscionable.  Even if I did
    not agree with him, I am satisfied that a high degree of deference is owed
    to the application judge on that issue.<i></i></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this court, the union did not advance the one cent per member theory but
    argued that a fine of $476.75 is a trivial sum.  In all of the circumstances,
    I disagree.<i></i></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    application judge rejected out of hand the submission that a fine representing
    the gross pay of an employee was justified because it represented the value
    of the work to the employer.  I agree with the application judge’s conclusion
    that basing the fine on the value of the work to the employer does not make
    an excessive fine justifiable.  It is the circumstances of the employee that
    determines whether the fine meets the test of substantial unfairness.  In
    this case, the application judge determined that a fine, which exceeded an
    employee’s take-home pay, “at a time when members may already be suffering
    financially as a result of strike action supports the conclusion that the
    fine provisions are very unfair.”  I note that counsel for the union argues
    that there was no direct evidence of members suffering financially as a result
    of the strike action.  While that may be so, the application judge’s general
    statement that members <u>may</u> be suffering financially appears to me
    to be a logical inference to draw from the circumstances of a cessation of
    work due to a strike.  <i></i></p>

    fact that Saskatchewan is the only jurisdiction in Canada that has seen fit
    to authorize a trade union to levy a fine on a member who crosses the picket
    line during a legal strike, limited to a member’s net pay, adds support to
    the conclusion of the application judge that a fine greater than that amount
    is excessive.  While I do not think it is necessary to conclude, as did the
    application judge, that no fine is enforceable in the absence of legislation
    authorizing the imposition of a fine, I find the legislation in
    <st1:State w:st="on">

    application judge also considered whether the fines provided under the constitution
    were justified in order to deter members from taking the benefits of union
    membership without accepting the burden of a work stoppage due to a legal
    strike.  He decided that there were more appropriate means than fines of
    the magnitude here to accomplish this end.  I also note that the respondents
    were suspended from union membership for three years.  In my view, a suspension
    of such duration is a significant penalty in itself.  The respondents not
    only lose the benefits of union membership but risk ostracism and ridicule
    from their fellow employees who are members of the union.<i></i></p>

    recognize that a fundamental principle of the union movement and the collective
    bargaining process is union solidarity.  I accept that the penalty provision
    in this case was aimed at preserving union solidarity.  As important as that
    principle is, the means adopted to achieve it in this case have been found
    to be “very unfair”.  <i></i></p>

    my view, the application judge applied the correct test for unconscionability
    to the agreed facts and to the inferences which he drew from those facts.  I
    can see no basis upon which this court could or should interfere with his

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Before
    leaving the question of unconscionability, I wish to comment on the dissenting
    reasons of Juriansz J.A.  My colleague suggests that the simple answer to
    the question concerning unconscionability is that the respondents could have
    resigned from the union before crossing the picket line and avoided the imposition
    of the fines.   If the respondents have the right to resign their union membership,
    I disagree that such action would take the element of unconscionability off
    the table.  <i></i></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    penalty clause in the union constitution is either unconscionable or it is
    not.  Resigning from the union does not change the conclusion that the penalty
    provision is unconscionable.  If this were so, no penalty clause could be
    unconscionable.  Let us suppose that the penalty clause provided for a $10,000
    fine per day for each day that a union member crossed the picket line or
    a fine of $500 for some other breach such as failure to wear a union hat
    during a strike.  In my view, no court would say that such a clause is not
    unconscionable because a union member could resign from the union before
    he or she crossed the picket line or declined to wear a union hat.  The failure
    to resign from the union before crossing the picket line or declining to
    wear a union hat does not turn an unconscionable penalty into an enforceable
    obligation.<i></i></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When
    the respondents joined the union, they entered into a contract, the terms
    of which were fixed at that point in time.  Only those terms which were not
    unconscionable could be enforced against them and the unilateral act of resignation
    at some later date does not make an unconscionable provision enforceable
    by the courts.<i></i></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    another point, Juriansz J.A. says that his real point of departure from my
    approach is the failure to focus the analysis on the quantum of the damages
    suffered by the union.  Juriansz J.A. refers to “the actual damage suffered
    by the union”.  I have two responses.  First, as already stated, there is
    not a scintilla of evidence of any damage to the union.  Second, if there
    was any evidence of damage, such damage would be to the other members of
    the bargaining unit.  Again, there is no such evidence.  In my view, the
    discussion about the intangible nature of damage to the union is simply irrelevant
    because there is no evidence of damage – intangible, actual or otherwise.<i></i></p>

    the imposition of fines for crossing a picket line during a legal strike
    in ss. 188(c)-(e) and 192(1)(f) of the <i>Public Service Labour Relations
    Act</i> does not entitle a union to impose such fines.  I do not find it
    necessary to decide whether the application judge was correct in holding
    that an express statutory grant is required to give the union such authority
    to impose a fine.  Whatever one may make of the statutory context under which
    this union operates, I find nothing in it that would permit the enforcement
    of a fine that the court found to be unconscionable.  <i></i></p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    indicated above, the application judge rejected the union’s argument that
    ss.&nbsp;188(c) – (e) and 192(1)(f) prohibited the union’s imposing of fines
    in situations that did not include a fine for crossing the picket line.  I
    do not find it necessary to decide whether the application judge was correct
    in holding that an express statutory grant is required to give the union
    such authority.  Whatever one may make of the statutory context under which
    this union operates, I find nothing in it that would permit the enforcement

style='"Times New Roman"'>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is a settled principle of administrative law that a party who seeks to challenge
    a decision of a domestic body must first exhaust his or her internal remedies
    before seeking judicial review in the courts.  I do not see that the principle
    applies here.  In this case, it is the union, not Mr. Birch and Ms. Luberti,
    who is seeking the court’s assistance.  In the case at bar, it is conceded
    that there is no provision in the union constitution or in the <i>Public
    Service Labour Relations Act</i> which provides for the enforcement of fines
    levied by the union.  In my view, it would be a surprising result to permit
    the union recourse to the courts to enforce a fine or penalty and deny the
    union member the right to advance a defence that the penalty was not enforceable
    because it was unconscionable.  I see no merit in this ground of appeal.  I
    perhaps should add that, unlike the application judge, I find it unnecessary
    to resort to rules 25.07(4) and 25.06(2) of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i> to
    come to this conclusion.<i></i></p>

    now asks this court to strike the claims with leave to amend to plead breach
    of contract without reference to the fine provision.<i></i></p>

      of the test, I prefer Armstrong J.A.’s own review and formulation of it.
      In my view the application judge, in applying the <i>Ekstein</i> formulation,
      concludes that the contract is unfair and that there is an inequality of
      bargaining power without sufficiently considering whether the unfairness
      stems from the unequal bargaining power. Keeping in mind whether “the stronger
      party has taken unfair advantage of the weaker” during the analysis makes
      it apparent, in my view, that the respondents’ plight - their liability
      for the fine imposed by the union - does not arise from an abuse of unequal
      bargaining power. </span></p>

    the outset of assessing the parties’ relative bargaining power, it is worth
    observing that employees in the bargaining unit can enjoy the wage rates
    and all the other employment benefits the union obtains without joining the
    union. The union lacks the power to adversely affect those who decline membership.
    The union needs to attract employees as members in order to mount collective
    action. As long as the majority of the employees become members and support
    the union, other employees can attend to their own individual interests while
    obtaining the benefits of the members’
    collective action. Therefore, it may well be a matter of debate which party
    had the greater need to persuade the other to enter the contract.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Notwithstanding
    the union’s need to recruit members, when the contract was formed the respondents
    lacked any ability to negotiate or change its terms until they became members.
    This is understandable because a union constitution, by its nature, must
    govern all its members in the same terms. Nonetheless, it follows that there
    existed an inequality of bargaining power in the negotiation of the terms
    of the contract.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Still,
    the existence of inequality of bargaining power alone does not render a contract
    unconscionable. There must be an abuse of that bargaining power. An abuse
    of unequal bargaining power is not difficult to find in an ordinary contract
    because the weaker party is generally locked into the contract. However,
    the situation is different with a union constitution because a member can
    resign from the union at any time. Both counsel accepted this fact and the
    appeal was argued on that basis.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

    for the union asserted that the purpose of the clause is not to prevent employees
    from working during a strike. Rather its purpose is to prevent them from
    working during a strike while remaining members of the union. He submitted
    in his factum “[m]embers can either support the strike or quit the union
    and cross the picket line: they cannot do both.” </p>

    for the respondents acknowledged that there is nothing in the record to explain
    why the respondents did not resign from the union. He offered several reasons
    why the respondents might have chosen not to do so. First, he said, perhaps
    they did not resign because they were aware they would be expelled from the
    union anyway. Second, he said a person who disagrees with what the union
    is doing in bargaining may decide not to resign because he or she values
    solidarity with the other employees. Third, he submitted that perhaps the
    respondents did not want to give up their right to vote on the ratification
    of the collective agreement, a right they would lose upon resigning. </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[85]<span

    accept counsel’s submissions about the value of union membership and his
    suggestions as to why the respondents might have wished to retain their union
    membership instead of resigning. The fact, however, is that the lack of bargaining
    power did not trap the respondents in a contract that subjected them to a
    penalty clause. They could decide for themselves whether the benefits of
    union membership outweighed the obligations of membership. They could not
    choose to enjoy the benefits of membership without being subject to its obligations.
    As long as they were members they were bound by the union’s constitution
    and bylaws. Section 4(13) of the union constitution provides:</p>
   <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Every individual member of the PSAC is deemed to
    agree to abide by and to be bound by the provisions of this Constitution
    and the applicable Component and Local By-Laws, upon applying for membership
    in the PSAC or continuing membership in the PSAC.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    take the view that the respondents had ample power in the contractual relationship
    to avoid the liability the application judge found to unconscionable. That
    liability resulted, not from a lack of bargaining power, but from the fact
    they did not resign their memberships before crossing the picket line. The
    union did not use its greater bargaining power to coerce performance. (It
    is worth repeating that, if they resigned, the respondents would still reap
    the results of collective bargaining, though they would forego the right
    to participate in union governance.)  </p>

    above finding is sufficient reason to conclude that the disciplinary provision
    is not unconscionable. I would go on to find that the disciplinary provision
    is not unconscionable for an additional reason - the fine imposed is not
    unfair. In his reasoning, Armstrong J.A., like the application judge, considers
    whether the fine is unfair from the perspective of the breaching union member.
    At paragraph 55 Armstrong J.A. says, “[i]t is the circumstances of the employee
    that determine whether the fine meets the test of substantial unfairness.” The
    application judge’s conclusion that the fine is unfair rested on the fact
    that the fine of gross pay exceeded the take home pay of the breaching union
    members earned during the strike at a time they were experiencing financial
    hardship. I disagree with this approach. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    begin with an aside about the application judge’s observation that a “hefty
    fine” was imposed “at a time when members may already be suffering financially
    as a result of strike action”. There was no evidence about the respondents’ financial
    circumstances. It may well be a logical inference that that workers on strike
    suffer financially. In spite of this, I do not consider the inference to
    be helpful in determining whether the fine is unfair. The clause specifically
    applies only to a situation where members are on strike and not being paid.
    In joining the union, the respondents took on the contractual obligation
    to undergo and endure a degree of financial hardship while on strike. Indeed,
    one might infer that the respondents suffered relatively less financial hardship
    than did their co-members who remained on the picket line. In my view, the
    notion that the respondents may have suffered financial hardship does not
    inform the determination of the fairness of the fine without relating it
    to the hardship that they would reasonably have foreseen when entering into
    the contract and to the hardship suffered by their co-members.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    real point of my departure from Armstrong J.A.’s reasoning, however, is that
    the analysis should focus primarily on the quantum of damage suffered by
    the innocent party rather than on the circumstances of the breaching party.
    The law does not regard it as unfair to make the party who breaches a contract
    liable for the whole of the innocent party’s damages even if that liability
    is greater than the profit made from the breach and irrespective of the breaching
    party’s financial position. Consequently, a stipulated remedy that reflects
    the actual damages suffered by the innocent party should not be found to
    be unconscionable, except perhaps in the most unusual circumstances.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    this reason one must begin the analysis of unfairness from the perspective
    of the damage suffered by the union. Granted, this is a challenging perspective
    because the union’s damage is intangible; the union has suffered damage to
    its solidarity. The difficulty of quantifying this damage, however, does
    not mean that the damage is not real and not significant. As the union`s
    counsel submitted “[s]olidarity forms the very heart of the relationship
    between the union and its members”. By breaking rank with their fellow members
    and electing to derive the benefits of their fellow members’ concerted action
    without contributing to it, the respondents have struck at the very core
    of the union’s solidarity. Union members who cross the picket line demoralize
    their fellow members and demonstrate to others the benefits of being “free
    riders”. Strike-breaking members provide labour to the employer thus undermining
    the other members’ collective action. Once collective action is undermined,
    there can be no union.</p>

    would find that the damage caused to the union by the respondents’ breach
    is real and significant. The question is whether the disciplinary provision,
    gross pay earned during the strike, is disproportionate to the damage making
    it unfair. At first blush, the damage suffered by the union appears completely
    intangible and its quantification subjective. Likewise, what one considers “unfair” may
    also appear to be largely subjective. By what criteria is the judgment made
    that a fine of gross pay is “unfair”? Take-home pay, which the application
    judge seemed to suggest is the maximum that could be appropriate, would not
    even remove the full amount by which the breaching members enriched themselves,
    as many of the deductions made from gross pay would stand to their credit
    in other accounts.  </p>

    the economic struggle of a strike, the union's fundamental goal is that its
    members provide no labour to the employer. To help foster the collective
    action necessary to attain the union's goal, the union's constitution forbids
    the members from working during a strike and they, by becoming and remaining
    members, agree not to work during a strike. In essence, the benefit that
    the union contracted for is that its members will provide no labour to the
    employer during the strike. Here, the appellants breached their contract
    by doing exactly that. In doing so they caused the union damage by diminishing
    its strength in its economic struggle with the employer. The amount by which
    the union’s strength has been diminished is equal to the quantity of labour
    provided to the employer. The best measure of the labour provided to the
    employer is the amount that the employer paid for it. It might even be argued
    that, during a strike, labour has a greater value to the employer than the
    usual wages paid. </p>

    from this perspective, gross pay is a reasonable, if not a particularly apt,
    pre-estimate of the estimable damage the union will suffer due to a member's
    breach of contract by working during a strike. The union’s total intangible
    damage would be even greater. If anything, it is a low estimate as it does
    not take into account the intangible damage to the union's solidarity. </p>

    should add that I am not troubled by the fact that the clause of the contract
    is written in terms of a disciplinary provision and not a pre-estimate of
    damages. This is not an ordinary contract but a union constitution.  The
    caution a court normally exercises before imposing its values on parties
    who freely enter into a contractual relationship should be heightened when
    the contract involved is a union constitution. In <i>Berry v. Pulley</i>,
    [2002] 2 S.C.R. 493, at para. 49, Iacobucci J., cautioned against losing
    sight of the surrounding collective bargaining context of this special kind

   <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[characterizing the union constitution as a contract]

      powers and duties of the union vis-à-vis its members, and in particular
      its ability to enforce the terms of the membership agreement internally, <u>it

    because of strong privative clauses and their own disinclination, have traditionally
    been reluctant to intervene in cases of labour law. The decisions of labour
    boards and arbitrators are almost always accorded the highest level of deference

    that the courts should exercise considerable restraint before finding a union

    have indicated my agreement with Armstrong J.A. that the doctrine of unconscionability
    applies to a contract<i> </i>between a union and its members.  The framework
    for dealing with the validity the internal disciplinary provisions of a union
