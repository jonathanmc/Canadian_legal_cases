    appeal involves the provisions of the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>, R.S.O.
    1990. c. H.8 (the “Act”) relating to the automatic suspension of a driver’s
    licence upon conviction for drinking and driving offences under the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>LEGISLATION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    41(1) of the Act provides that the driver’s licence of a person who is convicted
    under certain prescribed offences, including drinking and driving offences
    under the <i>Criminal Code,</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>is thereupon suspended<span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>,</span></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(f)  upon the first conviction, for one year;</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(g)  upon the first subsequent conviction,
    for three years; and</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(h)  upon the second subsequent conviction
    or an additional subsequent conviction, indefinitely.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    41(1) is “[s]ubject to subsections 41.1(1), (2) and (3)”.  Section 41.1(1)
    provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>41.1&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;Where the Registrar
    is satisfied that a person whose driver’s licence is suspended under clause
    41 (1) (f) or (g) has completed the prescribed assessments and remedial programs
    that are applicable to the person, if any, and meets the prescribed requirements
    that are applicable to the person, if any, the Registrar shall reinstate
    the driver’s licence upon the expiry of the suspension, subject to any other
    suspension under this Act.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly,
    s. 41.1(2) provides that an indefinite suspension under s. 41(1)(h) may be
    reduced to a 10 year suspension if the person has completed the applicable
    assessments, programs and requirements.  Section 41.1(3) allows the Registrar
    to suspend a person’s licence beyond the mandatory periods set out in s.
    41(1) until<i> </i>he or she is satisfied that the applicable assessments,
    programs and requirements have been met.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent was first convicted of impaired driving as a young offender in
    1994.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two
    years later, in 1996, he was again convicted of impaired driving at the age
    of 19.  He was sentenced to seven days in jail and prohibited from driving
    for two years under the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  His driver’s licence was suspended
    under the Act for the period then applicable to a second conviction, namely
    two years. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Three
    years later, in 1999, when he was 22 years old, the respondent faced a third
    drinking and driving offence: operating a motor vehicle while his blood-alcohol
    concentration exceeded the legal limit.  Following plea discussions, the
    respondent agreed to plead guilty and the Crown attorney agreed that for
    the purpose of sentencing, he would ask the court to treat the offence as
    a second rather than a third offence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent’s entire record was disclosed to the court after the plea was
    entered, but it was explained to the judge that the Crown “only going to
    proceed on the prior one of 1996” and that the respondent had entered his
    plea on the basis that the Crown would treat the offence as a second offence.  The
    trial judge accepted those submissions and imposed a sentence on that basis.  He
    advised the respondent that his licence would be suspended automatically
    under the Act “for two years I should think”
    and imposed a driving prohibition under the <i>Criminal Code</i> for that
    same two year period.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    advising the respondent that his licence would be suspended for two years
    under the Act, the trial judge was wrong on two counts.
     First, the period of automatic suspension for a second offence applicable
    at the time was three years, not two years, pursuant to s. 41(1)(g).  Second,
    and more importantly, despite the plea agreement for the purposes of sentencing
    under the <i>Criminal Code</i>, the respondent’s conviction should have been
    recorded as a third conviction leading to an indefinite suspension under
    s. 41(1)(h).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    as a result of a totally unrelated error regarding the way the respondent’s
    young offender conviction was recorded, the Ministry of Transport’s records
    revealed only one prior conviction.  The respondent was duly notified by
    the Registrar in a notice dated November 18, 1999:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>YOUR DRIVER’S LICENCE IS SUSPENDED UNDER SECTIONS
    41 AND 43 OF THE HIGHWAY TRAFFIC ACT FOR A PERIOD OF 3 YEARS. EFFECTIVE NOV.
    16, 1999.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    notice went on to advise the respondent that he would be required to pay
    a reinstatement fee of $100 to obtain his licence after the three year suspension
    period ended and that he would also be required to complete the impaired
    driving program for a fee of $475. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent paid both fees and completed the impaired driving program.  After
    his three year suspension had expired, the Registrar, “satisfied” that the
    requirements of s. 41.1(1) had been met, reinstated his driver’s licence
    in 2003.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    the reinstatement of his licence, the respondent purchased a home for himself
    and his family in a rural community practically inaccessible except by private
    motor vehicle.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    October 17, 2005, over two years after his licence had been reinstated, the
    Registrar sent the respondent another notice, this time advising him that
    he was “under a lifetime suspension”.  This notice was accompanied by a letter
    from the Deputy Registrar of Motor Vehicles explaining that a recent review
    of Ministry records had uncovered the fact that the respondent had been convicted
    of three motor vehicle related <i>Criminal Code</i> offences in the past
    10 years and that the Act provided for “an indefinite (lifetime) suspension
    that is reducible to 10 years if certain conditions are met”.  The letter
    explained that the method used to store and protect the young offender record
    was manual and that the fact that he had three convictions had not been observed
    when his three year suspension was imposed in November of 1999.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent was informed by the Registrar that his licence was therefore suspended
    indefinitely from the date of his third conviction in 1999.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>APPLICATION FOR JUDICIAL REVIEW</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent brought an application for judicial review before the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court requesting an order of mandamus requiring the Registrar
    to reinstate his licence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Court found that when he entered his plea of guilty, the respondent had been
    led to believe that he would be treated for all purposes as a second offender.  That
    belief, said the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court, was reinforced by the actions of the Ministry when his
    driver’s licence was reinstated following the three year suspension.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court found that on the basis of his understanding of the consequences
    of his plea, the respondent had structured his affairs in the belief that
    he had paid the price of his misconduct and that he was entitled to move
    on.  Though accepting the Ministry’s contention that s. 41(1)(h) of the Act
    was mandatory, the Court held that as a result of the effect of the “extraordinary,
    if not unique…. constellation of factors”, the respondent had been denied
    the “right to fair and reasonable treatment”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court concluded that the Ministry had acted “unreasonably”
    in cancelling his driver’s licence and the respondent was therefore entitled
    to an order setting aside the notice of suspension and reinstating his driver’s
    licence.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ISSUE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Ministry appeals, with the leave of this court, and submits that there is
    no authority for the Registrar, the Ministry, or the
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court to reinstate the respondent’s driver’s licence in the face
    of the statutorily imposed minimum suspension period under s. 41(1)(h) of
    the Act.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Ministry relies on the literal wording of s. 41(1).
     That provision imposes an automatic indefinite suspension that leaves neither
    the Ministry nor the Registrar with any discretion.  The Ministry submits
    that the moment the respondent was convicted of his third offence in 1999,
    his licence was “thereupon suspended”.  It follows, argues the Ministry,
    that however unfortunate or unfair to the respondent, nothing that occurred
    after what was, both in fact and in law, a third conviction is capable of
    supporting the respondent’s claim for the reinstatement of his licence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the Ministry that in the usual course, s. 41(1)(h) imposes an
    automatic indefinite suspension upon a third conviction and that the Registrar
    has no discretion in the application of this provision to particular individuals.  However,
    I cannot accept the Ministry’s submission that s. 41(1)(h) of the Act forecloses
    the respondent’s claim in the unusual circumstances of this case.  In my
    view, the Ministry’s argument fails to take into account all of the relevant
    facts and all of the relevant features of the statutory scheme governing
    the suspension and reinstatement of drivers’ licences.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is undisputed that when the respondent entered his plea of guilty in 1999,
    everyone – the Crown attorney, the respondent, his counsel and the trial
    judge – proceeded on the basis that his conviction would be treated as a
    second conviction for the purpose of sentencing.  It may well be
    that had the Ministry’s records revealed at this time (as they should have)
    that this was in fact the respondent’s third conviction, nothing that was
    said or done at the time of plea or sentence could have saved him from the
    automatic application of the indefinite suspension provision under s. 41(1)(h)
    of the Act. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> However,
    through an unrelated error in its record keeping, the Ministry likewise proceeded
    on the basis that this was the respondent’s second conviction.  The Ministry
    informed the respondent that his licence would be suspended for the period
    applicable to a second conviction and then reinstated his licence after he
    had complied with all of the statutory requirements applicable to a second
    conviction.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Upon
    discovering its own error some two years later, was it open to the Ministry
    to revoke the respondent’s licence so as to undo all that had been done and
    revert to the situation that existed four years earlier when the respondent
    entered his plea?  In my view, it was not.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    41.1(1) makes it clear that unlike the suspension provisions in s. 41(1),
    there is nothing automatic about reinstatement.  Before reinstating the licence,
    the Registrar had to be “satisfied” that the respondent had completed all
    of the “prescribed assessments and remedial programs” and the he met the
    “prescribed requirements” for a driver’s licence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Registrar acted on the statutory power conferred by s. 41.1(1) and issued
    the respondent a driver’s licence.  Having treated the conviction as a second
    conviction and the Registrar having been satisfied that the licence should
    be reinstated pursuant s. 41.1(1), it is my view that the Ministry cannot
    now revert to what the Registrar should have done in 1999.  This would allow
    the Ministry to completely ignore the earlier official acts of the Registrar
    in suspending the respondent’s licence for three years and then reinstating
    it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    see nothing in the Act that specifically gives the Registrar the power to
    revoke a driver’s licence that the Registrar has reinstanted.  The automatic
    mandatory suspension periods in s. 41(1) are explicitly made <i>subject to</i> the
    reinstatement provision in s. 41.1(1).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    the Registrar acted upon its statutory power to reinstate the respondent’s
    licence, particularly in the light of all that had gone on before, the respondent
    was entitled in law to act on the basis that he had a valid driver’s licence.  As
    the old Latin maxim has it, <em>omnia praesumuntur rite et solemniter esse
    acta</em><em><span

    (Attorney General) </i>(2000), 51 O.R. (3d) 641, at para. 258 relating to
    administrative errors and the need for finality and certainty are apposite:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Apparently valid acts of public officials are relied
    upon by the members of the public at large in planning their affairs. Official
    documents are taken at face value. The purported exercise of a statutory
    or prerogative power creates legitimate expectations that the law will protect.
    The administration of government is a human act and errors are inevitable.
    The rights of a party aggrieved by the error must be reconciled with the
    interests of third parties and the interests of orderly administration. </p>

    Divisional Court observed, on the unusual facts of this case, it would be
    entirely unfair and unjust to allow the Ministry to interpret the Act as
    the Ministry suggests.  The respondent certainly cannot be faulted for operating
    under the universally shared assumption, induced by a variety of errors including
    the Ministry’s own error in record keeping, that his conviction was being
    treated for all purposes as a second, rather than a third, conviction.  He
    structured his affairs on the basis that his licence, which appeared to have
    been properly reinstated pursuant to the Act, was valid.  The Ministry should
    not be permitted to ignore the steps taken by the Registrar and disavow the
    Registrar’s earlier exercise of statutory authority of reinstating the respondent’s
    licence.</p>
