    appeal – like a surprising number that go before it – is largely dependent
    on the transition provisions in s. 24 of the <i>Limitations Act, 2002</i>,
    S.O. 2002, c. 24, Sch. B (the “new Limitations Act”).  To decide the appeal,
    the court must draw together its previous jurisprudence and articulate the
    principles which guide the interpretation of the new Limitations Act and,
    particularly, s. 24.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>OVERVIEW</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    chronology of the major events in this litigation provides a useful overview.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>November 13, 1982 – Robert

    Hospital (the “Hospital”).  He was severely hypoglycaemic and suffered serious
    brain injury.  As a result, he is mentally incompetent.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>November 13, 2002 – a medical
    malpractice lawsuit was started on Robert’s behalf.  The defendants are Dr.
    Makkay, the obstetrician and gynaecologist who provided Robert’s mother with
    medical care during her pregnancy, and the Hospital.  The running of the
    limitation period was suspended in respect of Robert’s claim because of his
    mental incapacity.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>January
    1, 2004 – the new Limitations Act came into effect.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>May 17, 2006 – a second
    lawsuit was commenced on Robert’s behalf.  The doctors who treated Robert
    after his birth, while he was in the Hospital, were named as defendants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Spring 2007 – the plaintiffs
    moved to consolidate the two actions.  Some of the defendants in the second
    action moved to have it struck.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>December 18, 2007 – based
    on the provisions of the new Limitations Act, the second action was found
    to have been commenced outside the limitation period.  Consequently, the
    plaintiffs’
    motion was dismissed and the second action was struck. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    its heart, this appeal revolves around a single question:  in respect of
    limitation periods, what provisions apply to a claim pursued in the court
    for an act or omission that occurred prior to January 1, 2004 – those that
    governed prior to January 1, 2004, or those contained in the new Limitations
    Act?  The answer to that question depends primarily on the transition provisions
    in s. 24 of the new Limitations Act.  As I explain, a proper application
    of s. 24 leads to the conclusion that the second action is governed by the
    provisions that operated prior to January 1, 2004.  Accordingly, it was brought
    in time with the result that I would allow the appeal. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Robert
    St. Jean was born on November 13, 1982.  Shortly after birth, he became severely
    hypoglycaemic.  Allegedly as a result of a failure to properly treat the
    hypoglycaemia, Robert suffered severe brain damage that rendered him a mental
    incompetent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    November 2002, Robert’s mother, Jennifer St. Jean, consulted Justin Linden,
    a lawyer.  On November 13, 2002, Robert’s 20<sup>th</sup> birthday, Mr. Linden
    commenced a medical malpractice lawsuit (the “first action”).  The plaintiffs
    in the first action are Robert, by his litigation guardian, and Jennifer.  The
    defendants in the first action are Dr. Zoltan Makkay and the Hospital.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the first action, the plaintiffs allege that Dr. Makkay and the Hospital
    were negligent in the medical care provided to Jennifer before, during and
    after Robert’s birth.  The primary allegation is that as a result of the
    failure to diagnose and treat Jennifer’s gestational diabetes, Robert was
    born severely hypoglycaemic.  However, the claim also alleges a failure on
    the part of Dr. Makkay and the Hospital to test Robert’s blood sugar levels
    after he was born and to monitor and treat him appropriately.  None of the
    three individual doctors who treated Robert after his birth while he was
    in the Hospital – Dr. Wai Ming Cheung, Dr. John Murray and Dr. Rosalind Curtis
    (the “new defendants”) – were named as defendants in the first action.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Christine
    Parnell, a law clerk in Mr. Linden’s office, was Robert’s litigation guardian.  Mr.
    Linden and Robert’s then litigation guardian received the complete hospital
    chart in relation to Robert’s birth by February 2003.  It is undisputed that
    a review of the chart would have disclosed the postnatal care that Robert
    received from each of Drs. Cheung, Murray and Curtis.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the summer of 2005, Gary Will, another lawyer, assumed carriage of this matter.  On
    receiving the file, Mr. Will retained a neonatologist to provide an opinion
    on the likely cause of Robert’s brain injury.  The neonatologist opined that
    the likely cause of Robert’s injury was the protracted hypoglycaemia that
    followed his birth which was inadequately treated.  In his view, had Robert’s
    hypoglycaemia been treated more aggressively, Robert would not have suffered
    injury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    May 17, 2006, Mr. Will commenced an action (the
    “second action”) against the new defendants, Dr. John Doe, the Hospital and
    Nurse Jane Doe.  The plaintiffs in the second action are Robert by his litigation
    guardian, Jennifer, Jennifer personally and Nicole St. Jean, Robert’s sister
    (the “appellants”).   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants brought a motion for an order consolidating the two actions or,
    alternatively, adding the defendants in the second action to the first action.<a href="#_ftn1"

    strike the second action on the basis that it was statute-barred.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    order dated December 18, 2007, the motion judge dismissed the appellants’ motion
    and struck the statement of claim in the second action (the “Order”).</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE MOTION JUDGE’S DECISION </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    reasons of the motion judge are contained in two endorsements, dated March
    19, 2007, and August 10, 2007, respectively.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the first endorsement, the motion judge began by considering the limitations
    provisions that governed Robert’s claim prior to January 1, 2004, the effective
    date of the new Limitations Act.  He concluded that because Robert is mentally
    incompetent, the one-year limitation period prescribed by s. 17 of the <i>Health
    Disciplines Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.4<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a> (the applicable provision at the time of Robert’s
    birth but repealed and replaced by an equivalent provision in the <i>Regulated
    Health Professions Act, 1991</i>, S.O. 1991, c. 18),<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[3]</span></span></span></a> is suspended by virtue of s. 47 of the <i>Limitations
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. L. 15<a href="#_ftn4"
name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[4]</span></span></span></a> (the “former Limitations Act”).  Under s. 47 of
    the former Limitations Act, the running of the limitation period is postponed
    or suspended where the plaintiff is “a mental defective, mental incompetent
    or of unsound mind” and does not begin to run until the person is of sound
    mind.  As Robert is mentally incompetent, time had not begun to run.  Further,
    the motion judge held that the appointment of a litigation guardian did not
    trigger the running of the limitation period.  He concluded that the former
    limitation period had not expired.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge noted that it was common ground between the parties that the
    transition provisions in s. 24 of the new Limitations Act applied.  He also
    observed that the claim against the new defendants was based on acts or omissions
    that took place prior to January 1, 2004, and that no proceedings had been
    commenced in respect of the claim against the new defendants prior to that
    date.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge then considered whether s. 24(5)2 of the new Limitations Act
    applied.  He viewed two conditions as necessary for it to apply: (1) the
    former limitation period could not have expired, and, (2) the claim against
    the new defendants must have been discovered prior to January 1, 2004.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
    on his earlier conclusion that the former limitation period had not expired,
    the motion judge found that the first condition had been met.  In respect
    of the second condition, however, he found that the claim against the new
    defendants had not been discovered before January 1, 2004.  Although the
    litigation guardian in the first action knew the material facts relating
    to the claim against the new defendants before January 1, 2004, the motion
    judge was of the view that it was not until January 1, 2004, that a litigation
    guardian could discover a claim on behalf of a person with a legal disability.  Thus,
    he held that for the purposes of s. 24 of the new Limitations Act, the litigation
    guardian became aware of the material facts on January 1, 2004.  As a result
    of this determination, the motion judge was of the view that s. 24(5)1 – rather
    than s. 24(5)2 – of the new Limitations Act applied.  Consequently, the two-year
    limitation period established by s. 4 of the new Limitations Act operated.  That
    period expired on the second anniversary of the day on which the claim was
    discovered, that is, January 1, 2006.  As the second claim was brought after
    January 1, 2006, the motion judge found that the claim was commenced outside
    the limitation period established by the new Limitations Act.      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the second endorsement, the motion judge held that as a result of s. 21(1)
    of the new Limitations Act, the court had no discretion to add parties after
    the expiration of the limitation period.  In any event, he found that there
    were no special circumstances that justified the addition of the new defendants
    as parties to the first action or to permit the commencement of the second
    action.   </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    primary issue on appeal is whether the motion judge erred in his application
    of s. 24 to the instant case.  (For convenience, the full text of s. 24 is
    appended to these reasons as Schedule “A”.)   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    well, the appellants ask this court to determine whether the motion judge
    erred in his application of s. 21 of the new Limitations Act, or, alternatively,
    in failing to properly consider the existence of special circumstances.         <b><i></i></b></p>

    it is clear that the first condition is met.  The appellants’ claim is based
    on acts or omissions that took place in November 1982, at Robert’s birth
    and shortly thereafter, long before January 1, 2004.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is a dispute, however, about whether the second condition has been met, that
    is, whether a proceeding had been commenced in respect of the claim before
    January 1, 2004.  The appellants say that the first action is such a proceeding
    and, therefore, the second condition is not met.  They rely on <i>Pepper
    v. Zellers Inc</i>. (2006), 83 O.R. (3d) 648, a decision of this court, in
    support of their contention that the first action amounted to a proceeding
    that had been commenced before January 1, 2004.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    relevant facts of <i>Pepper v. Zellers</i> are these.  Ms. Pepper alleged
    that in August 2002, her pharmacy and pharmacist mislabelled her medication,
    as a result of which she suffered harm requiring hospital care.  In October
    2002, the plaintiffs started an action in negligence and breach of contract
    based on the mislabelling of the medication.  The pharmacy that dispensed
    the medication was named as the defendant in the action.  After January 1,
    2004, the plaintiffs attempted to add the dispensing pharmacist as a defendant.  The
    motion to add the pharmacist was dismissed on the basis that the plaintiffs
    had failed to exercise due diligence in ascertaining the identity of the
    dispensing pharmacist.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    appeal, this court held that the new Limitations Act did not apply to extend
    the one-year limitation period against the dispensing pharmacist because
    the second condition in s. 24(2) had not been met.  At para. 26, the court
    stated that s. 24(2) only applied if no proceeding had been commenced before
    January 1, 2004, and “a proceeding with respect to this incident was commenced
    in 2002”.      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    new defendants argue that the first action does not amount to a proceeding
    for the purposes of s. 24(2).  They rely on this court’s decision in <i>Meady
    v.</i> <i>Greyhound Canada Transportation Corp</i>. (2008), 90 O.R. (3d)
    774, which was released after the Order was made.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Meady</i>,
    the plaintiffs were injured in a bus collision that occurred on December
    23, 2000.  They alleged that the collision was caused by the defendant, Shaun
    Davis, who seized the steering wheel of the bus while it was moving, causing
    it to crash.  The plaintiffs started separate actions against
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City

    Davis and various others in June 2001.<b><i></i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    the expiry of the relevant limitation period, one of the defendants added
    Dr. James as a third party to the action.  The allegation in the third party
    claim was that Dr. James had been negligent in failing to provide proper
    medical care for
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Davis and that Dr. James’ negligence caused or contributed to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Davis’s actions which caused the accident.  In December 2004, all the actions,
    including the third party claims, were ordered to be consolidated.  <b><i></i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    limitation period expired in December 2002.  In October 2006, the plaintiffs
    sought to add Dr. James as a party defendant to the action.  The motion judge
    held that s. 21(1) of the new Limitations Act applied and that it precluded
    the addition of Dr. James as a defendant.     <b><i></i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    appeal, this court held that the motion judge erred in applying s. 21 of
    the new Limitations Act.  In reaching this determination, it was necessary
    to determine whether the conditions in s. 24(2) had been met.  Justice Feldman,
    writing on behalf of the court, concluded that although the plaintiffs had
    commenced a proceeding before January 1, 2004, it was not a proceeding in
    respect of acts or omissions of Dr. James and, therefore, it was not a proceeding
    within the meaning of s. 24(2).  At para. 11 of the reasons, she explains:<b><i></i></b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The term “claim” is defined in s. 1 of the new
    Act as “a claim to remedy an injury, loss or damage that occurred as a result
    of an act or omission”.  This definition focuses on particular acts or omissions,
    even if more than one act or omission by more than one party contributed
    to the same injury.  The term “proceeding” is not defined in the new Act.  However,
    it is defined in rule 1.03(1) of the Rules of Civil Procedure, R.R.O. 1990,
    Reg. 194, as “an action or application”.  Thus, the words “claims
    … in respect of which no proceeding has been commenced” in s. 24(2) refer
    to claims resulting from particular acts or omissions by a particular party
    for which no court action has been commenced.  This interpretation has been
    applied in several decisions of the Superior Court of Justice, including <i>Pallotta
    v. Marks</i>, [2005] O.J. No. 2963, [2005] O.T.C. 606 (S.C.J.), in which
    Hoy J. noted at para. 23 that it would be inconsistent with the scheme of
    the new Act
    “for ‘proceeding’ in s. 24(2) to be interpreted without reference to the
    person against whom the proceeding is made”.  Accordingly, although the plaintiffs
    commenced a proceeding within the limitation period against certain defendants
    in respect of their acts or omissions, no proceeding was commenced by the
    plaintiffs in respect of the acts or omissions of Dr. James.  Consequently,
    the transition provision, s. 24 of the new Act, applies. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, <i>Pepper </i>has been overtaken by the more nuanced approach in <i>Meady</i>.  The
    word “proceeding”
    in s. 24(2) cannot be sensibly interpreted without reference to the party
    or parties against whom an action is brought.  The acts or omissions had
    to have been performed by someone. Before the second action was commenced,
    there had been no proceeding based on the acts or omissions of the new defendants
    in 1982.  In the first action, it was the acts or omissions of Dr. Makkay
    and the Hospital which were the basis of the claim.  <b><i></i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    I conclude that no proceeding had been commenced prior to January 1, 2004,
    for the purposes of s. 24(2).  Accordingly, both conditions in s. 24(2) are
    met and “this section” – that is, s. 24 – applies to the second claim.  <b><i></i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    turning to s. 24(5), which is the applicable part of s. 24 for the present
    appeal, I wish to comment on the new defendants’
    contention that if the court determined that a proceeding had been commenced
    prior to January 1, 2004, the provisions in the new Limitations Act would
    nonetheless apply.  This submission flows from the new defendants’ approach
    to the new Limitations Act as a whole, which is that its provisions govern
    any claim that is proceeding in the courts after January 1, 2004, unless
    the transition provisions dictate that the claim is to be governed by the
    former limitation period.  Even in that instance, the new defendants contend,
    all of the provisions of the new Limitations Act apply with the exception
    of the limitation period.<b><i></i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    a number of reasons, I do not accept this submission.  First, this court
    has made it clear that where a claim is based on an act or omission that
    took place before January 1, 2004, and a proceeding based on the claim was
    commenced prior to that date, the new Limitations Act does not govern the
    claim: see <i>Pepper v. Zellers </i>at para. 26 and <i>Camilli v. Guardian
    Insurance </i>(2008), 61 C.C.L.I. (4<sup>th</sup>) 182 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), at para. 2.  <b><i></i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the new defendants’ view is based largely on s. 2(1) of the new Limitations
    Act.  Section 2(1) reads as follows:<b><i></i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>This Act applies
    to claims pursued in court proceedings other than,</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>(a)  proceedings to which
    the <i>Real Property Limitations Act </i>applies;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>(b)  proceedings in the
    nature of an appeal, if the time for commencing them is governed by an Act
    or rule of court;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>(e)  proceedings based on
    the existing aboriginal and treaty rights of the aboriginal peoples of Canada
    which are recognized and affirmed in section 35 of the <i>Constitution Act,
    1982</i>; and</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><i>(f)</i>  proceedings
    based on equitable claims by aboriginal peoples against the Crown.  <b><i></i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not read s. 2(1) as purporting to govern all claims being pursued in the
    courts after January 1, 2004, regardless of when the acts or omissions on
    which the claim is founded took place or whether a proceeding had been commenced
    prior to that date.  The purpose of s. 2 is to establish that the Act applies
    to claims <i>pursued in court proceedings</i> with certain exceptions, which
    are listed in paras. a through f.   <i>Guillemette v. Doucet </i>(2007),
    88 O.R. (3d) 90 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), relied on by the new defendants as support for their view, does not suggest
    otherwise.  In <i>Guillemette</i>, Doherty J.A., writing for the court, considered
    s. 2 for exactly that purpose.  He first determined whether the claim in
    question was being pursued in court proceedings and then he looked to see
    whether it fell within one of the exceptions.<a

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

    means of the transition provisions.<a href="#_ftn8"

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore,
    s. 2 provides that “the Act” applies to claims pursued in court proceedings.  The
    Act includes the transition provisions in s. 24, the purpose of which is
    to determine whether its provisions or the former limitation provisions apply
    to claims based on acts or omissions that took place before January 1, 2004.  <b><i></i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    I reject the argument because to find that the new Limitations Act applies
    even if a proceeding has been commenced prior to January 1, 2004, would be
    to give the Act retroactive effect.  <b><i></i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Legislation
    has retroactive application when the effect of applying it to particular
    facts is to deem the law to have been different from what it actually was
    when the facts occurred.<a href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[9]</span></span></span></a>  The rationale that underlies the presumption
    against retroactive application is explained in <i>Sullivan on the Construction
    of Statutes, </i>5<sup>th</sup> ed. (
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Markham: LexisNexis Canada Inc., 2008), at p. 677:<b><i></i></b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is obvious that reaching into the past and declaring
    the law to be different from what it was is a serious violation of the rule
    of law.  As Raz points out, the fundamental principle on which [the] rule
    of law is built is advance knowledge of the law.  No matter how reasonable
    or benevolent retroactive legislation may be, it is inherently arbitrary
    for those who could not know its content when acting or making their plans.  And
    when retroactive legislation results in a loss or disadvantage for those
    who relied on the previous law, it is unfair as well as arbitrary. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>                                                …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>For these reasons it is strongly presumed that
    legislation is not intended to be retroactive. [Footnotes omitted.]  <b><i></i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    accept that the new Limitations Act applies even if a proceeding has been
    commenced before January 1, 2004, amounts to a retroactive application of
    its provisions because such an interpretation would have the effect of deeming
    the law to be different from what it was when the facts occurred.  If Robert’s
    law suit against the new defendants had been commenced prior to January 1,
    2004, the running of the former limitation period would have been suspended
    by virtue of s. 47 of the former Limitations Act.  If the new Limitations
    Act were held to apply, it would operate backwards and impose a two-year
    limitation period on Robert’s claim.  That is, it would deem the law on limitation
    periods to be different from what it was at the time the proceeding was commenced.       <b><i></i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    presumption against retroactive application means that statutes are not to
    be construed as having retroactive operation unless such a construction is
    expressly, or by necessary implication, required by the language of the legislation.  There
    is nothing in the scheme or purpose of the new Limitations Act that would
    overcome the application of the presumption.    <b><i></i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    said that, I would observe that procedural legislation is presumed to have
    immediate application – that is, it is assumed to apply to both ongoing and
    future proceedings.  In that sense, it may be regarded as having retrospective
    effect as it will apply to ongoing litigation that was commenced under prior
    procedural rules.  As previously indicated, a statute is retrospective – as
    opposed to retroactive –
    when it operates in a forward fashion to attach new legal consequences to
    an event that took place before the statute was enacted.  Whether a statutory
    provision is purely procedural and, accordingly, has retrospective application
    is a matter that must be determined on the facts of each case.  To be considered
    purely procedural, the application of the provision to the specific facts
    must not result in the interference with any substantive rights or liabilities
    of the parties or produce other unjust results: see Sullivan at pp. 696-98. <b><i></i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the new Limitations Act may have retrospective application in respect of
    purely procedural matters, extinguishing the right to pursue a claim is not
    purely procedural as it would alter substantive rights.  In <i>Martin v.
    Perrie</i>, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 41, at para. 17, the Supreme Court of Canada
    quoted with approval the following extract from the decision of the High
    Court of Australia in <i>Maxwell v. Murphy </i>(1957), 96 C.L.R. 261, at
    pp. 277-78:<b><i></i></b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Statutes of limitation are often classed as procedural
    statutes.  But it would be unwise to attribute a prima facie retrospective
    effect to all statutes of limitation.  Two classes of case can be considered.  An
    existing statute of limitation may be altered by enlarging or abridging the
    time within which the proceedings may be instituted.  If the time is enlarged
    whilst a person is still within time under the existing law to institute
    a cause of action the statute may well be classed as procedural.  Similarly
    if the time is abridged whilst such person is still left with time within
    which to institute a cause of action, the abridgment might again be classed
    as procedural.  <b>But if the</b> <b>time</b> is enlarged when a person is
    out of time to institute a cause of action so as to enable the action to
    be brought within the new time or <b>is abridged so as to deprive him of
    time within which to institute it whilst he still has time to do so, very
    different considerations could arise</b>.  <b>A cause of action which can
    be enforced is a very different thing to a cause of action the remedy for
    which is barred by the lapse of time.  Statutes which </b>enable a person
    to enforce a cause of action which was then barred or<b> provide a bar to
    an existing cause of action by abridging the time for its institution could
    hardly be described as merely procedural.  They would affect substantive
    rights.  </b>[Emphasis added.]<b> <i></i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    p. 700 of Sullivan, these notions are succinctly summarised in the following
    terms:<b><i></i></b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>When a new limitation of action provision comes
    into force, it may extend or shorten the period within which an action must
    be commenced.  If the provision comes into force before the period has lapsed,
    and if applying it would not have the effect of extinguishing the right of
    action, then its application to those facts is said to be purely procedural.  In
    such a case, for both parties, the only thing that is lost or gained is time.  However,
    when the effect of applying the new provision is either to extinguish an
    action that was still viable when the provision came into force, or to revive
    an action that was barred, more than time is at stake. In such a case, the
    provision affects the substantive rights of the parties and cannot be considered
    purely procedural. <b><i></i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    conclusion on this point, the transition provisions in s. 24 are the express
    means provided by the new Limitations Act to determine when it applies to
    a claim based on acts or omissions that took place prior to January 1, 2004.  Section
    24(2) provides that “its” provisions (<i>i.e</i>. s. 24) only apply if both
    conditions are met.  If a proceeding has been commenced prior to the effective
    date, the conditions in s. 24(2) will not have been met and s. 24 cannot
    apply.  The result is that the substantive aspects of the claim continue
    to be governed by the law as it existed prior to January 1, 2004.    <b><i></i></b></p>

    that divides the parties is whether rule 1 or rule 2 of s. 24(5) applies.  If
    rule 1 applies, the new Limitations Act applies as if the act or omission
    had taken place on January 1, 2004.  If rule 2 applies, however, the former
    limitation period governs.  Which of rule 1 or 2 applies depends on whether
    the claim was “discovered” before January 1, 2004.          </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants argue that the claim was discovered before January 1, 2004.  They
    submit that the motion judge erred when he held that the litigation guardian
    appointed in the first action could not “discover” the existence of a claim
    until January 1, 2004.  They contend that a claim is discovered when the
    material facts on which it is based have been, or ought to have been, discovered
    by the exercise of reasonable diligence.  In making this submission, they
    rely on the common law meaning of discoverability.  As the litigation guardian
    in the first action had knowledge of all the material facts giving rise to
    the claim in the second action by no later than February 2003, the claim
    was discovered at that time.<b><i> </i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    new defendants argue that the motion judge correctly found that Robert’s
    claim against them was not “discovered” before January 1, 2004.  They say
    that Robert’s claim against them was not discovered before January 1, 2004,
    because before that time, only he, as the person with the claim, was capable
    of discovering it.  Thus, whether or not he had a litigation guardian who
    knew all the material facts on which to base a claim, the limitation clock
    did not start to run because the claim was not “discoverable”.  They argue
    that because Robert’s mental incompetence prevented him from discovering
    his claim, the claim could not have been discovered before January 1, 2004.  While
    the new Limitations Act changed the law so that discovery of a claim by a
    litigation guardian is now deemed to be discovery of the claim by the person
    under a disability, where the litigation guardian acquired the knowledge
    before January 1, 2004, January 1, 2004, is deemed to be the day of discovery.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not accept the new defendants’ submission.  It is correct that prior to
    January 1, 2004, the appointment of a litigation guardian for a minor (or
    incompetent) plaintiff did not have the effect of “crystallizing” a claim
    and thereby cause the limitation period to begin to run: see <i>Rothwell
    v. Raes </i>(1988), 54 D.L.R. (4th) 193; affirmed on appeal (1990), 2 O.R.
    (3d) 332 (C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused (1991), 2 O.R. (3d) xii.  However,
    the reason is not, as the new defendants contend, because the claim could
    not be discovered by anyone other than the person with the claim.  In <i>Rothwell </i>at
    pp. 266-68, Osler J. referred to the well-settled principle of law that the <i>Rules
    of Civil Procedure</i> may not be permitted to conflict with an Act of the
    legislature.  He noted that it was the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i> that
    created the mechanism by which a litigation guardian could be appointed to
    pursue a claim by a person under a disability.  Accordingly, he concluded
    that appointment of a litigation guardian pursuant to the <i>Rules of Civil
    Procedure</i> could not overcome the “absolute protection” given to the person
    with the disability provided by s. 47 of the former Limitations Act.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12" title=""><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly, <i>Murphy
      v. Welsh; Stoddard v. Watson</i>, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 1069, does not stand
      for the proposition that only the person with the claim could discover
      the claim.  In <i>Murphy v. Welsh</i> at p. 1080, the Supreme Court of
      Canada explained that the reasonable discovery rule was fashioned in incest
      cases to prevent the injustice of a claim becoming statute-barred before
      the plaintiff became aware of its existence.  There is nothing in the reasoning
      to suggest that the claim could not be discovered by anyone other than
      the person with the claim.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    accept the appellants’ submission on this matter.  In my view, the claim
    was discovered prior to January 1, 2004.  Robert’s litigation guardian is
    treated as having discovered the claim against the new defendants when she
    obtained the hospital records in February 2003.  Her knowledge was acquired
    in her capacity as Robert’s litigation guardian and, therefore, in law can
    be imputed to Robert but not for the purposes of triggering the running of
    the limitation period.  The fact that the running of the limitation period
    was suspended during the period of incapacity does not mean the claim could
    not have been discovered by the litigation guardian.  The two notions are
    different, but related, and should not be conflated.  The decision of the
    Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Peixeiro v. Haberman</i>, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 549,
    supports this view.  In <i>Peixeiro</i>, the Supreme Court stated, at para.
    41, “There is no conflict between the rule in s. 47 of the [former]
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario <i>Limitations Act </i>(which merely codifies the common law rules
    against allowing time to run against those under a legal disability) and
    the discoverability principle.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would add that the normal meaning of the word
    “discovered” accords with this view.  Think of the many law suits that are
    started while a person is in a period of incapacity.  Although the limitation
    period does not run during the incapacity, the act or omission that founds
    the claim must have been discovered as it is the basis for the lawsuit.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, interpreting “discovered” in this way is consistent with the meaning
    given to that word elsewhere in the new Limitations Act.  Section 5(1) of
    the new Limitations Act provides that a claim is discovered on the earlier
    of (a) the day on which the person with the claim first knew certain things
    and (b) “the day on which a reasonable person with the abilities and in the
    circumstances of the person with the claim first ought to have known of the
    matters referred to in clause (a)”.  Section 8 of the new Limitations Act
    provides that “[i]f a person is represented by a litigation guardian in relation
    to the claim, section 5 applies as if the litigation guardian were the person
    with the claim.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    to the extent that ss. 5 and 8 of the new Limitations Act guide the interpretation
    to be given to the word “discovered”
    in s. 24(5) 1 and 2, Robert discovered the claim in February 2003 when his
    litigation guardian received the hospital records.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> It
    was suggested that to interpret “discovered” by reference to ss. 5 and 8
    for events that pre-date January 1, 2004, amounts to giving the legislation
    retroactive effect.  I disagree.  Interpreting the word “discovered” in that
    manner does not have the effect of deeming the law to be different from what
    it was prior to January 1, 2004.  Rather, this approach enables the court
    to apply the word “discovered” in s. 24(5) in the manner intended by the
    legislature.  It is a basic tenet of statutory interpretation that language
    in a piece of legislation is used consistently.  As Ruth Sullivan states
    in <i>Sullivan on the Construction of Statutes,</i> 5th edition, at p. 361: “[I]t
    is assumed that language is used consistently, that tautology is avoided,
    that the provisions of an Act all fit together to form a coherent and workable
    scheme.” (footnotes omitted)  As the meaning of the word “discovered”, for
    the purposes of the new Limitations Act is contained in s. 5, following this
    tenet of statutory construction, one would apply that same meaning to the
    word throughout the legislation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    conclusion on this point, rule 2 of s. 24(5) is operative and the former
    limitation period applies.  The former limitation period in s. 24 includes
    the postponement or suspension of a limitation period pursuant to s. 47 of
    the former Limitations Act: see <i>Philion (Litigation Guardian of) v. Lemieux
    (Estate of) </i>(2007), 85 O.R. (3d) 1 (C.A.), at paras. 18 – 21.  Thus,
    the running of the limitation period continues to be suspended due to Robert’s
    mental incapacity and the second action was brought in time.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>SECTION 21 OF THE NEW LIMITATIONS

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    21(1) of the new Limitations Act reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1)  If a limitation period in respect of a claim
    against a person has expired, the claim shall not be pursued by adding the
    person as a party to any existing proceeding.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    new defendants argue that s. 21 operates to preclude them from being added
    to the first action.  I disagree for two reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    while this court has concluded that s. 21 removes any discretion from the
    court to add a party to an action after the expiry of the applicable limitation
    period,<a
href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[13]</span></span></span></a> by its terms, s. 21 only applies where a limitation
    period has expired.  As I have explained, the former limitation period applies
    in the present case and it has not expired.  Thus, s. 21 does not apply to
    the second action.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    court’s decision in <i>Meady</i> provides the second reason.  In <i>Meady</i>,
    the court found that the “former limitation period”, as that term is used
    in s. 24 of the new Limitations Act, includes “all aspects of the operation
    of that period, including extensions based on special circumstances.”<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[14]</span></span></span></a>  Accordingly, in deciding whether the former
    limitation period could be extended, the court held that the doctrine of
    special circumstances was applicable and s. 21 of the new Limitations Act
    was inapplicable.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would add one caution in respect of the expression of this point made in <i>Meady</i> at
    para. 12, where Feldman J.A. states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The motion judge applied s. 21(1) of the new Act.  However,
    that section only applies to claims based on acts or omissions that occurred
    after January 1, 2004, the effective date of the new Act.  It does not apply
    to claims governed by the transition provisions in s. 24.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    last sentence in the above quotation must be read in context.  Read in isolation,
    it suggests that s. 21 cannot apply to claims that predate January 1, 2004,
    nor to claims governed by the transition provisions in s. 24.  A reading
    of the full judgment, however, shows that what is meant is that for claims
    based on acts or omissions that occurred before January 1, 2004, if the application
    of the transition provisions in s. 24 leads to the conclusion that the provisions
    of the new Limitations Act apply, such provisions – including s. 21 – apply.  If
    the application of the transition provisions leads to the conclusion that
    the claims are governed by the former limitation period, then the former
    limitation period, including all aspects of the operation of that period,
    apply.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the present case, the former limitation period applies.  As I have already
    explained, s. 47 of the former Limitations Act is one aspect of the operation
    of the former limitation period.  Section 47 suspended the running of the
    limitation period, thus, the appellants have the right to add the new defendants
    to the first action as the claim against those defendants was not statute-barred.        </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>SPECIAL CIRCUMSTANCES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the former limitation period applies to the second action, all aspects of
    that period apply, including the ability to extend the limitation period
    if there are special circumstances:  see <i>Meady</i> at para. 22.  However,
    as the relevant limitation period has not expired, it is unnecessary to decide
    whether the motion judge failed to properly consider the existence of special
    circumstances.    </p>
