style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is an appeal from the order dated August 10, 2007 in which the motion judge
    ordered the appellant to repay $159,873 and to expunge $296,887 of receivables.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 style='line-height:
normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, because the motion judge lacked jurisdiction on a motion to grant
    the relief sought in the action, the appeal must be allowed.  To explain
    this conclusion it is necessary to review the lengthy and complicated history
    of the litigation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 style='line-height:
normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    litigation arose over a dispute between the appellant and other unit owners
    regarding control of a commercial condominium corporation, Carleton Condominium
    Corporation 396 (CCC 396).  The ensuing litigation has involved numerous
    motions and appeals.  We refer only to those proceedings that are relevant
    to the disposition of this appeal.<span class=MsoFootnoteReference> <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

  <p class=headingNUMBER0 style='line-height:
normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents commenced this proceeding in 2001 when they brought an application
    pursuant to the oppression remedy provision of the <i>Condominium Act, 1998</i>,
    S.O. 1998, c. 19, s. 135(3).  On the return of the application, Granger J.
    made an order on consent (the 2001 order).  That order provided that the
    application would proceed by way of an action.  The order also adjourned
    a pending motion until after the close of pleadings and prohibited the appellant
    in the meantime from taking any steps to enforce alleged defaults by the
    respondents.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 style='line-height:
normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Seven
    years later, the action has proceeded no further because the respondents
    have never delivered a statement of claim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 style='line-height:
normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    on April 2, 2002, the respondents brought a contempt motion on the basis
    that the appellant had failed to comply with the prohibitions contained in
    the 2001 order.  On the return of the motion, in addition to ordering that
    the 2001 order would remain in force, the motion judge ordered the appellant
    to produce books and records relating to his management of CCC 396, appointed
    an independent manager to assume management of CCC 396, and appointed accountants
    as auditors to prepare a forensic audit.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 style='line-height:
normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    April 29, 2005, the respondents purported to return the original application
    before the same motion judge.  On the return of that “application”, the motion
    judge ordered the appellant to produce documents to the auditor and to pay
    various costs (the 2005 order).  He also gave the respondents permission
    to register a lien against the appellant’s interest in his CCC 396 units.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 style='line-height:
normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    August 10, 2007, the respondents returned the matter to the court by way
    of a Notice of Return of Application, again before the same motion judge.  The
    Notice described the proceeding as an “application originally returnable
    on November 29, 2001, brought back on April 2, 2002, and again on April 29,
    2005, and adjourned on that date”.  The respondents argued that when the
    appellant had control of CCC 396, in addition to other misconduct, he improperly
    billed CCC 396, both personally and through E.T.R.E. Inc., a company that
    the motion judge held was merely an alter ego for the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 style='line-height:
normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents also claimed that the appellant refused to provide the required
    documents to the court-appointed auditor in violation of the 2002 order and
    the 2005 order.  In addition to the relief sought in the earlier proceedings,
    the respondents sought, among other things, an order requiring the appellant
    to pay and to repay the sums of $12,485.00 and $159,863.00 to CCC 396 and
    to expunge $296,887.00 worth of receivables E.T.R.E. Inc. claimed it was
    owed by CCC 396.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 style='line-height:
normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s chartered accountant, Ken Lagasse, filed a report giving his
    opinion that, at most, the respondents were billed an extra $4.00 per month
    per unit.  The appellant argued that such an amount could not form the basis
    for an oppression remedy.  The appellant also claimed that he provided all
    financial records that were properly requested.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 style='line-height:
normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge rejected the Lagasse report and accepted the report of the court-appointed
    auditor.  He also rejected the appellant’s evidence regarding production
    of documents.  The motion judge granted the respondents’ requested monetary
    relief.  In our view, this result was not open to the motion judge. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 style='line-height:
normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since
    the application was converted to an action, there was no “application” for
    the respondents to return before the motion judge.  The issue of the respondents’
    claim for a declaration of oppressive conduct must be determined at trial
    after an exchange of pleadings.  The only matters that could be returned
    before the motion judge were those involving the outstanding interlocutory
    dispositions and contempt.  We do not accept the respondents’ argument that
    the award involving more than $450,000 was in effect an award relating to
    the appellant’s contempt.  We see no finding of contempt in the motion judge’s
    reasons or order relating in any way to the relief granted.  Moreover, the
    motion judge had no jurisdiction to grant substantive relief as a remedy
    for contempt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 style='line-height:
normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Consequently
    we would allow the appeal, set aside paras. 1, 2, 3 and 6 of the motion judge’s
    order and remit the motion for determination of the interlocutory relief
    and the contempt motion.  These issues will be returned to the Superior Court
    before a different judge.  In our view, it is appropriate that para. 4 of
    the order remain in force as it maintains the status quo pending the trial
    of the action. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER0 style='line-height:
normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The
    appellant is entitled to his costs of the appeal and for the appearance before
    the motion judge, which we fix at $15,000, inclusive of disbursements and
    Goods and Services Tax.</p>
