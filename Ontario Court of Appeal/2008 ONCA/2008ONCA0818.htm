    June 29, 2003, the 10-year-old complainant in the predicate offence was playing
    with two friends down the street from her home. The 45-year-old appellant
    lived in an apartment across the road from where the girls were playing.
    He overheard the complainant saying that her mother had some puppies for
    sale. He called out to the complainant from his apartment and asked her to
    give him her mother's telephone number. </p>

'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    a videotaped statement given to the police later the same day, the complainant
    said that after she told the appellant that she was not allowed to give out
    her telephone number, he asked her to come to his apartment so he could give
    her his telephone number. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According
    to her videotaped statement, the complainant went up to the appellant's apartment
    and he closed and locked the door. The complainant said that while she was
    in the apartment, the appellant showed her some pornographic pictures on
    his computer, asked her to show him her
    &quot;boobs&quot;, and promised to give her two dollars if she did so. She
    refused. The appellant gave her his telephone number on a piece of paper
    and two dollars. He promised to take her to another man who would give her
    $500 for showing her boobs. When the complainant declined, the appellant
    told her not to tell anyone about the incident, said he would hurt her if
    she did so, and let her out of the apartment. </p>

'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the appellant submits that the trial judge's reasons are inadequate because
    they fail to reconcile conflicting evidence concerning the “enticing” element
    of the offence, an aspect of the <i>actus
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    reus</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant contends that the term “enticing”
    requires that an accused be proactive in inducing a child to accompany him
    or her, such that the conduct of the accused amounts effectively to “taking” the
    child in question. In this case, the complainant's own evidence concerning
    how she arrived at the appellant's apartment is conflicting. Although she
    said in her videotaped statement to the police, which she adopted at trial,
    that the appellant asked her to come up to his apartment to get his telephone
    number, during cross-examination at trial she said that the appellant did
    not say anything to her about coming to his apartment and she could not remember
    why she did so. The appellant submits that, in these circumstances, the trial
    judge committed reversible error by failing to reconcile the conflicting
    evidence and any potentially conflicting interpretations of the term “enticing”. </p>

    the trial judge's reasons on this issue might have been clearer, he acknowledged,
    when setting out the Crown's position, that the defence contested the element
    of enticing. The trial judge noted the Crown's position that the enticing
    element was established by the appellant’s suggestion that the complainant
    come upstairs after she refused his request for her telephone number and
    that the invitation to come upstairs was confirmed by the evidence of the
    appellant's neighbour. Later in his reasons, the trial judge said that he
    accepted the neighbour's evidence, albeit without referring to this specific
    point. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Subsequently,
    after reviewing the appellant’s submissions, which focussed on whether the
    appellant had the necessary <i>mens rea</i> for the offence, the trial judge
    made an explicit finding that the Crown had proven the enticing element of
    the offence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, it is implicit in the trial judge's reasons that he accepted the
    complainant's evidence that the appellant invited her to his apartment based
    on the confirmatory evidence from the neighbour. Similarly, it is implicit
    that the trial judge accepted the Crown’s position that enticing was made
    out based on the totality of the exchange between the complainant and the
    appellant, during which the appellant invited the complainant to his apartment
    after she had declined his initial request for her telephone number. We see
    no error in the trial judge’s conclusion that the enticing element was satisfied
    and we would not give effect to this ground of appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant's second argument on his conviction appeal is that the trial judge's
    reasons demonstrate that he erred in his interpretation and application of
    the <i>mens rea</i> requirement under s. 281. In particular, the appellant
    submits that the trial judge was unduly preoccupied with the appellant's
    motives, a danger the appellant says the Supreme Court of Canada cautioned
    against in <i>R. v. Chartrand</i>, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 864, and furthermore,
    that he failed to make an explicit finding that the appellant was subjectively
    aware that the consequences of his act would be to deprive the complainant's
    mother of possession of her child. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    disagree. The trial judge’s reasons on this issue are as follows:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Finally, <u>I fail to see
      how Mr. Hopkins</u>, who brought [the complainant] into his apartment, <u>would
      not think he was depriving [the complainant’s mother] of the control of
      her daughter.</u> Mr. Hopkins did not have [the complainant’s mother’s]
      consent to have [the complainant] in his apartment and [the complainant]
      did not ask to go to his apartment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>I agree with Crown counsel
    that the depriving of [the complainant’s mother] of control of her child
    can be for a short period of time, and that no restraint is necessary. <u>I
    infer from the facts Mr. Hopkins’ intention. He decided to deprive the mother
    of the control of the child to satisfy his needs.</u> There was no justification
    for the taking. He was not playing at being a good Samaritan. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>…</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><u>I agree with Madam Justice
      L’Heureux-Dube’s statement in <i>R. v. Chartrand</i>, “It will be rare
      indeed that the deprivation of a child from parents was not the intent
      of the impugned act</u>”, <u>saying it’s an inference for the trier of
      fact</u>. Then, in the end, if the purpose of the section is to be achieved, <u>foresight
      of the continuity or even certainty of the end result must be sufficient</u>.
      Mr. Hopkins had to know his actions could only bring him trouble. [Emphasis
      added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the trial judge referred to the appellant’s motives, he did so in the context
    of assessing the appellant’s subjective intention. Section 281 protects a
    parent’s right to possession of their child in the sense of their right to
    have care and control of their child. Enticing a child away from a parent
    to harm the child is inconsistent with the parent’s continuing care and control.
    The presence of a motive to harm is therefore a relevant factor in assessing
    whether the necessary subjective intent to deprive the parent of possession
    of the child exists. Read fairly, the trial judge’s reasons demonstrate that
    he was aware of the requirement of subjective foresight and made the necessary
    finding. We would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
    on the foregoing reasons, the conviction appeal is dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>The Sentence Appeal</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant raises three issues on his sentence appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    he claims that the trial judge erred in finding that the predicate offence
    qualifies as a “serious personal injury offence” as that term is defined
    in s. 752 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. As there was neither violence nor
    threats involved in the predicate offence, the appellant submits that the
    Crown was required to show that the predicate offence either endangered or
    was likely to endanger the complainant's “life or safety or was likely to
    inflict severe psychological damage on her”. Because the latter component
    of this test relates to psychological damage, the appellant submits that
    the safety component is restricted to physical safety and is therefore not
    applicable. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Concerning
    the psychological component, Dr. Klassen testified that there is general
    consensus in the scientific community that 25% of child sexual abuse victims
    have significant ongoing psychiatric problems, 25% have moderate ongoing
    problems and 50% end up with minor problems or no problems at all. Given
    Dr. Klassen's testimony and the absence of expert evidence about the potential
    impact of the incident on the psychological well-being of the complainant,
    the appellant submits that the trial judge erred in holding that the predicate
    offence was a serious personal injury offence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    disagree. The appellant is a psychopath and a pedophile. Evidence at trial
    of the predicate offence indicated that, at the time that the appellant invited
    the complainant into his apartment, he was engaged in surfing the internet
    for pornography, some of which was extremely violent. The appellant not only
    showed the complainant pornography, he importuned her to disrobe. Evidence
    on the dangerous offender application established that the appellant has
    sexually abused a number of children. On these facts, we fail to see any
    reasonable basis for concluding that the complainant’s safety was not endangered
    by the appellant’s actions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s second argument on his sentence appeal is that the trial judge
    committed reversible error by admitting evidence concerning alleged criminal
    conduct for which the appellant was previously prosecuted and acquitted,
    thereby offending the <i>res judicata</i> principle and the issue estoppel
    principle, and violating s. 11(h) of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not accept this submission. The impugned evidence related to an alleged
    sexual assault in 1992 on then 15 year-old J.R. We acknowledge that the appellant
    was tried and acquitted of this allegation and that the trial judge who presided
    over the sexual assault trial rejected J.R.’s evidence. However, although
    evidence about the sexual assault was adduced on the dangerous offender application,
    on a fair reading of the trial judge’s reasons, we are not persuaded that
    he accepted or relied on that evidence. More importantly, even if he did,
    we are not persuaded that such reliance formed a material part of his reasoning
    concerning the dangerous offender designation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>J.R.
    did not testify about the details of the sexual assault on the dangerous
    offender hearing; rather, she testified about conduct of the appellant that
    preceded the sexual assault. She said that the appellant showed her pornographic
    magazines while touching his penis. The evidence about the nature of the
    alleged sexual assault was led by the defence during cross-examination of
    C.B (another Crown witness). C.B. testified that J.R. said she was raped
    by the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Apart
    from summarizing J.R.’s evidence<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a> (along with the evidence of all other past complainants),
    the trial judge referred to the incident with J.R. on only one further occasion
    in his reasons, in relation to the likelihood that the appellant would reoffend.
    In that section of his reasons, the trial judge summarized a list of occasions
    when the appellant reoffended while on parole or soon after being released
    following warrant expiry. The list related to six different time frames over
    a period of several years. The impugned evidence related to a single time
    frame and was not the only misconduct that occurred in that time frame.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    referring to the incident with J.R. in this section of his reasons, the trial
    judge described the appellant as “engag[ing] in sexually aggressive behaviour” with
    J.R. and two other individuals. The trial judge then noted that the appellant
    arranged for an alibi witness to testify falsely when he was subsequently
    charged for sexually assaulting J.R. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    the manner in which the trial judge referred to the incident with J.R., we
    are not  persuaded
     that  he  accepted or relied on  the hearsay evidence concerning the sexual
    assault. If the trial judge relied solely on J.R.’s evidence about the pornography-masturbation
    incident, such reliance would constitute an error in law only if the question
    of whether that incident occurred was resolved in the appellant’s favour
    at the sexual assault trial, either on the basis of a positive factual finding
    or reasonable doubt: see <i>R. v. Mahalingan</i>, 2008 SCC 63, at para. 22. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, it is unnecessary that we resolve this issue. Even assuming that
    the trial judge relied improperly on evidence about a sexual assault on J.R.,
    or on evidence about the pornography-masturbation incident that was resolved
    in the appellant’s favour at the sexual assault trial, we are not persuaded
    that such an error requires a new hearing. Simply put, although the trial
    judge referred to an incident between the appellant and J.R., it was but
    one of many examples of misconduct that the trial judge referred to and was
    not the most serious. Viewed in context, it cannot be said to have formed
    a material part of the trial judge’s reasoning concerning the dangerous offender
    designation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    we would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s third argument on his sentence appeal is that the trial judge
    erred in designating the appellant as a dangerous offender when the evidence
    supported a long-term offender designation. Concerning this error, the appellant
    submits that the trial judge misinterpreted and failed to consider relevant
    evidence, with the result that the trial judge overstated the appellant’s
    future dangerousness and underestimated the potential for controlling him
    in the community. The appellant points, in particular, to the failure of
    the trial judge to refer to the evidence of Mr. Remus, of the John Howard
    Society, suggesting that the appellant could be adequately supervised at
    a particular residence operated by the John Howard Society and, in addition,
    claims that the trial judge misinterpreted the evidence of Dr. Klassen. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    disagree. In light of his pre-sentence custody, the only realistic sentencing
    alternative in relation to the appellant involved releasing him into the
    community virtually immediately subject to a ten-year supervision order.
    The trial judge referred to the appellant’s previous dismal record while
    on community release orders. Even assuming that the appellant could be placed
    at the John Howard facility, the longest period during which that facility
    has ever housed an offender is two and one half years. Moreover, the evidence
    suggested that the appellant requires virtually constant supervision, which
    would not be provided at the John Howard facility. In these circumstances,
    the trial judge was justified in declining to accept Mr. Remus’s plan.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s core finding concerning Dr. Klassen’s evidence was that it
    was premised on too many hoped–for successes relating to the appellant to
    constitute a viable release plan. The trial judge’s findings concerning pharmacological
    treatment demonstrate his conclusion. The trial judge noted that the appellant
    had refused this treatment in the past and that, because of his psychopathy,
    could do so again at any time in the future. The expert evidence made it
    clear that successful pharmacological treatment was central to a successful
    release plan. Although the appellant could be re-incarcerated at any time
    if he refused this treatment, the maximum term would be ten years. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the circumstances, we see no error in the trial judge’s appreciation of Dr.
    Klassen’s evidence or in his ultimate conclusion that a long-term offender
    order was not appropriate. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>Disposition</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
