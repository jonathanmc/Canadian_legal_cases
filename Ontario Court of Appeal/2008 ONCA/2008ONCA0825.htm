  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This is a somewhat unusual appeal.  The issues between the appellant and
    respondent are no longer contentious. The appellant (the “Director”) all but concedes
    that the appeal should be dismissed and the order of Kent J. affirmed.  However, the Director submits that there is
    uncertainty regarding the power to make an order directing imprisonment upon
    default in payment under the terms of a temporary order made pursuant to s.
    41(14) of the <i>Family Responsibility and
    Support Arrears Enforcement Act, 1996</i>, S.O. 1996, c. 31 (“FRSAEA”).  The Director asks this court to confirm the
    existence of the power to make that order where circumstances warrant.  Additionally, the Director submits that,
    assuming the power to make the order exists, this court should identify the
    steps judges should take to ensure that the proposed subject of the committal
    order is treated fairly when the order is made.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondent agrees that, although the issues
    between the Director and the respondent are no longer contentious, this court
    should address the two issues identified by the Director.  The respondent makes the point that default
    proceedings are very common, and often occur in high volume courts in which the
    defaulting payor is unrepresented, except perhaps by duty counsel.  Further, the respondent observes that
    temporary default orders, by their nature, expire relatively quickly and are
    not readily susceptible to appellate review.  The respondent submits that committal orders which carry with them the
    risk of imprisonment are becoming common features of temporary orders made when
    default proceedings are adjourned.  The
    respondent joins the Director in submitting that the family law bench and bar would
    benefit from a pronouncement by this court as to the existence of the statutory
    power in issue.  The respondent also
    submits that this court should address the procedural protections needed to
    ensure that a person whose liberty may be compromised by a committal order is
    treated fairly when that order is made. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We would dismiss the appeal.  We will address the two issues identified
    above.  </p>
  <h1>II.        THE FACTS</h1>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is no longer necessary to address whether the
    appellate court erred by striking the committal term from the temporary default
    order.  The respondent’s present support
    obligations are set out in an order of Gordon J. of the Superior Court of
    Justice dated May 15, 2008.  That order
    postdates the order under appeal and its terms are not in issue in this
    appeal.  Further, the Director does not support
    the imposition in January 2008 of the committal term in the temporary default
    order under appeal.  However, the facts surrounding
    the efforts to enforce the support orders made against the respondent provide a
    useful context within which to address the two issues raised by the Director.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Various child and spousal support orders were
    made against the respondent between September 2002 and September 2005.  As of September 2005, the respondent was required
    to make support payments totalling $1,880.00 per month.  The support orders were filed with the
    Director’s office for enforcement.  The
    payments were current in June 2006.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>By February 8, 2007, the respondent was in arrears
    on the payments owed under the support orders.  The Director commenced a default hearing proceeding pursuant to s. 41 of
    the FRSAEA.  The notice of hearing,
    personally served on the respondent, as required by the rules, informed him
    that:</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>a default hearing would occur on April 2, 2007;</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>he owed $5,196.61 on the support orders;  and</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>at the default hearing, the court could make an
    order against him “including an order for your imprisonment for up to 180
    days”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondent appeared unrepresented on April
    2, 2007.  He was granted an adjournment
    to June 4, 2007 to allow him to pursue a motion to vary the terms of his
    spousal support order.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On June 4, 2007, the default hearing was
    adjourned to August 13, 2007, pending resolution of the respondent’s motion to
    vary the terms of his spousal support order, scheduled to be heard in July 2007.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On August 13, 2007, the default hearing was
    adjourned, for a third time, to January 7, 2008, pending resolution of the
    motion to vary the support order which was still outstanding.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondent’s motion to vary the support
    order was heard on November 29, 2007.  The respondent was represented by counsel in this proceeding.  Certain variations in the support order were
    made.  The respondent’s support
    obligations were increased slightly to $1,955.00 a month.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  In making the variation order, the judge
    noted that the respondent was in arrears on both child and spousal support, and
    that “his 50% wage deduction does not meet the ongoing support obligations.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On January 7, 2008, the default hearing came before
    the court for the fourth time.  The
    respondent was unrepresented.  Counsel
    for the Director advised the court of the terms of the variation order made in
    November 2007.  Section 41(22) authorizes
    the incorporation of the terms of the variation order into any order made
    pursuant to s. 41(10) at the default hearing.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for the Director advised the court that
    the respondent was now represented by counsel in the default proceedings, but
    that counsel was unavailable on that day.  The motion judge agreed to adjourn the default hearing to March 17, 2008
    so that counsel for the respondent could attend.  She acceded to counsel for the Director’s
    request and made a temporary order requiring the respondent to make the support
    payments set out in the November 2007 order pending the return of the default
    motion in March 2008.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The following exchange ensued:</p>

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:

    that Andrew Fischer is to pay the on-going order of child support and spousal
    support of $1955.00 per month commencing January 1st, 2008.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondent was present throughout the

  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

    temporary default order.  He obtained a
    stay of the committal term on January 17, 2008.  On April 9, 2008, Kent J. heard the appeal of the temporary default
    order.  By order dated April 10, 2008, he
    allowed the appeal and struck the committal provision.  In his reasons, he observed:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>The effect of
    including a committal in the event of default provision in the temporary order
    creates a real possibility that this appellant could be incarcerated without a
    default hearing being conducted and without having had the benefit of his
    counsel being able to make submissions to the presiding judge.  Such incarceration would be inappropriate.</p>
  <h1>III.       ANALYSIS</h1>
  <h3><b>(1)       The statutory power to make a temporary
    order for support that includes a term directing imprisonment upon default in
    payment</b></h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The current statutory scheme governing default
    hearings is found in s. 41 of the FRSAEA and Rule 30 of the <i>Family Law Rules</i>, O. Reg. 114/99, as
    amended.  The Director may initiate the
    default proceedings.  The Director
    prepares a statement of arrears.  The
    payor files a financial statement and, if so inclined, a default dispute.  The court may hear oral testimony, direct the
    production of other relevant documentation, and add parties to the default
    proceedings: ss. 41(1), (4), and (5); rule 30(3).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At the hearing, the amount of arrears owed, and
    the payor’s ability to pay, are the central issues.  Section 41(9) puts the onus on the payor, as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:
left;page-break-after:avoid'>41(9)  Presumptions at hearing</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>At the default
    hearing, unless the contrary is shown, the payor shall be presumed to have the
    ability to pay the arrears and to make subsequent payments under the order, and
    the statement of arrears prepared and served by the Director shall be presumed
    to be correct as to arrears accruing while the order is filed in the Director’s
    office.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The court conducting a default hearing may
    adjourn that hearing, and may make a temporary order pending the ultimate
    resolution of the default hearing.  Section 41(14) describes the court’s power to make temporary orders:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>41(14)  Temporary orders</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>The court may
    make a temporary order against the payor… that includes any order that may be

style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section 41(10) sets out the panoply of remedial
    powers available to the court on the disposition of the default hearing.  Any one or more of those powers may be
    exercised by the court “unless it is satisfied that the payor is unable for
    valid reasons to pay the arrears or to make subsequent payments under the order”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The various orders available under s. 41(10) include
    an order under s. 41(10)(i) directing the imprisonment of the payor upon
    failure to comply with the payment terms of a default order made under this subsection:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>The court may,

    any payment ordered under this subsection, be imprisoned continuously or
    intermittently until the period specified in the order, which shall not be more
    than 180 days, has expired, or until the payment is made, whichever is
    sooner.  </p>

    when adjourning a default hearing to make a temporary order for support
    payments that includes a term directing the imprisonment of the payor upon
    failure to comply with the payment terms.  We accept this interpretation of the legislation.  The statutory language is clear.  Nothing in s. 41(14) detracts from the scope
    of the remedial powers available under s. 41(10).  The full range of those remedial powers,
    including imprisonment upon non-payment, is available to a judge making a temporary
    order.  There is nothing that
    distinguishes the nature of payment orders made pursuant to a temporary order in
    a default proceeding from payment orders made as part of a final order in the
    same proceeding.  Resort to committal as
    a means of enforcement may be necessary in either case.  Subject to a constitutional challenge, and none
    is made in this case, the statute should be given effect according to the plain
    meaning of its language.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Recognizing that a statute gives the court the
    power to make a committal order as a term of a temporary order made in a
    default proceeding does not, of course, speak to the propriety of imposing that
    term in any given case.  The FRSAEA and
    predecessor legislation dealing with the enforcement of default orders have
    always regarded imprisonment for non-payment of those orders as the enforcement
    mechanism of last resort.  Something more
    than non-payment is required.  The
    payor’s conduct must demonstrate a wilful and deliberate disregard for the
    obligation to comply with court orders:  see e.g. <i>Morrison v. Allen</i> (1987), 11 R.F.L. (3d) 225 (
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Further, the case law and the FRSAEA recognize
    that imprisonment for non-payment is meant as a means of enforcing the support
    order and not as a means of punishing the payor.  The payor must be released upon payment of
    the amount owed: see s. 41(10)(i).  A committal
    order, imposed as a term of either a temporary or final order in a default
    hearing, is intended to induce compliance with the payment terms of the order.  The prospect of imprisonment hopefully focuses
    the payor’s mind on the importance of making the required payments.  The enforcement rationale for imprisonment
    upon non-payment makes sense only if the payor has the ability to make the payments
    required by the order:  see <i>Saunders </i>at paras. 11-13.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The constraints on the use of imprisonment where
    the payor fails to comply with an order made at the end of a default proceeding
    have full application to non-compliance with temporary orders made in those
    proceedings.  At least two additional
    factors suggest further caution.  First,
    presumably the adjournment of the hearing indicates that the court is satisfied
    that the full merits of the default hearing should be addressed at a subsequent
    time.  Courts should be hesitant to order
    the potential imprisonment of the payor absent the full inquiry into the merits
    of the proceedings.  Second, where the
    matter is adjourned, presumably the payor will be back before the court within
    a relatively short time.  Any failure to
    comply with the temporary order may well be more appropriately addressed when
    the default proceeding is back before the court.<a

  <h3><b>(2)       The appropriate procedure where the court
    proposes to impose a committal order</b></h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel advise that the payor is often unrepresented
    in default hearings.  We will assume that
    the payor is unrepresented in considering the steps that a court should take to
    ensure that a payor is treated fairly before making a committal order as a term
    of a temporary order under s. 41(14).  Counsel agree that, before making a committal order, the court must be
    satisfied that the payor is aware of the nature and effect of the proposed
    committal order and is given a fair opportunity to speak to the appropriateness
    of the imposition of a committal order in the circumstances.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for the respondent favours a more formal
    process involving the taking of evidence under oath and giving the payor an opportunity
    to call evidence and cross-examine witnesses.  Counsel for the Director submits that the level of formality suggested
    by counsel for the respondent is neither necessary, nor appropriate.  He makes the point that temporary orders are
    made in the context of the adjournment of the default hearing.  Counsel for the Director suggests, correctly
    in our view, that the formalities associated with a full hearing on the merits
    are not necessary when settling the terms of an adjournment.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In our view, the courts that conduct default
    hearings are better positioned than this court to appreciate and address the
    demands of fairness in any given circumstance.  However, a few broad observations may be helpful.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The liberty of a payor who is potentially the subject
    of a committal order is put in jeopardy if the order is made.  At a minimum, fairness in the context of a
    proposed order that could result in imprisonment requires that:</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the court explain to the payor the nature of the
    proposed committal order and the effect it could have on the payor’s liberty;</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the court explain to the payor why it is considering
    making the committal order;  and</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the payor be given an opportunity to respond to
    the reasons offered by the court and to advise the court of any additional
    facts that may be relevant to the court’s decision to make the order.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is best left to the wisdom of individual
    judges in individual cases to decide exactly how to ensure that the payor is
    given the necessary information and the opportunity to put his or her position
    forward.  We do, however, accept that the
    context in which the proposed order is being considered must be borne in mind in
    deciding what steps are necessary to ensure that the payor is treated fairly.  Where the order in issue is a term of an adjournment
    sought by the payor, it would not be helpful to impose a procedural regime that
    would effectively result in adjournments to gather further information so that
    the terms of the adjournment could be settled.  The common sense of the courts conducting these hearings will no doubt
    prevail.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We also think that if the court concludes that a
    committal order is a proper term of a temporary order, the court should make
    the adjournment of the default proceedings as short as the circumstances
    reasonably permit, thereby hopefully reducing the risk of non-compliance.</p>

    payor to make the requisite payments during the term of the temporary order
    will be addressed when the default proceedings continue on the adjournment
    date.  This procedure suggests that
    including a committal term in the temporary order may not result in immediate
    incarceration upon non-payment, but may result in imprisonment after the final
    default order is made.  </p>
