  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was convicted of aggravated assault following an altercation outside
    a bar.  The central issue at trial was identity.  The Crown’s case rested
    almost entirely on the evidence of Bing who identified the appellant as one
    of two men who attacked the victim.  Bing observed the altercation, saw the
    assailants flee to a nearby apartment, saw the police enter the apartment
    shortly thereafter and return with two men, one of whom was the appellant
    wearing the distinctive red shirt observed by Bing during the fight.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge erred in his analysis of the identification
    evidence.  We disagree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the reasons of the trial judge demonstrate that he was fully alive
    to all the potential frailties in the identification evidence that had been
    raised by the appellant but that after full consideration of all of the evidence,
    he found that the Crown had proved its case beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant relies in particular on evidence relating to hair colour.  At the
    time of the incident, Bing was not asked, nor did he give, any description
    of the perpetrator’s hair colour.  At trial, his recollection was that the
    perpetrator had dark or black hair.  It is clear that the appellant has blond
    hair.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    case is distinguishable from the <i>Chartier</i> line of authority where
    a detail observed by the witness at the time of the offence exculpates the
    accused.  Here, it was only months later at trial that the witness gave the
    erroneous detail regarding hair colour.  The trial judge took this into account
    as what he described as a potentially fatal flaw in the Crown’s case, but
    concluded after considering all the evidence that Bing’s recollection of
    hair colour at trial did not give rise to a reasonable doubt.  In our view,
    it was open to him on this record to reach that conclusion. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also argues that the evidence as to the appellant’s height was
    wanting.  While no evidence as to the appellant’s height was led to link
    to Bing’s evidence comparing the assailant’s height to his own, the trial
    judge was entitled to make his own observations of Bing and the appellant
    in court and to assess the accuracy of Bing’s observations on that basis.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the appellant argues that certain crucial evidence was given in response
    to a leading question.  It is not clear to us that the question eliciting
    Bing’s response that he was certain of the appellant’s identification at
    the time of the arrest was in fact elicited by a leading question.  In any
    event, that would not necessarily exclude consideration of that evidence
    but would only affect its weight.  Moreover, Bing’s certainty was only one
    of the many factors taken into account by the trial judge in finding on all
    the evidence that the Crown had proved its case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    we dismiss the appeal.</p>
