    applicant was charged with a number of counts under the <i>Highway Traffic
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.8 (“HTA”) and the <i>Compulsory Automobile Insurance
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.25 (“CAIA”) arising out of a collision between
    his vehicle and a train.  After a trial before a justice of the peace, he
    was found guilty on all counts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    applicant appealed to Fitzgerald J. sitting as an appeal judge in the Ontario
    Court of Justice pursuant to s. 116(2)(a) of the <i>Provincial Offences Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. P.33 (“POA”).  The appeal judge noted that some of the grounds
    of appeal dealt with<i> Charter</i> matters and stated that he had no jurisdiction
    to deal with them.  He indicated, however, that he had read all of the materials
    and concluded that, in any event, the applicant had failed to demonstrate
    any error in law or in principle.  He dismissed the applicant’s appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    applicant seeks leave to appeal to this court from the judgment of the appeal
    judge pursuant to s. 131 of the POA. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is well-established that a<i> </i>POA court is a court of competent jurisdiction
    for the purposes of awarding relief under s. 24(1) of the<i> Charter</i>:<i> </i>see <i>R.
    v. 974649 Ontario Inc.</i>, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 575.
     Thus, the appeal judge erred in stating that he did not have jurisdiction
    to deal with the applicant’s <i>Charter </i>arguments.  The question is whether
    this error of law requires me to grant leave to appeal in order to prevent
    a miscarriage of justice and to maintain public confidence in the administration
    of justice: <i>R. v. Harry, </i>(1998), 39 O.R. (3d) 673 (C.A.). <i> </i>In
    my opinion, it does not.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the applicant now alleges that he was not tried within a reasonable time
    within the meaning of s. 11(b) of the <i>Charter, </i>it does not appear
    that he made such an application at trial.  The thorough reasons of justice
    of the peace
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Forth, list a substantial number of adjournments made at the applicant’s
    request.  Taking these into account, and the lack of any evidentiary record
    concerning prejudice, this ground of appeal has no arguable chance of success. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly,
    a review of the record indicates that the applicant, who represented himself
    at the trial, was afforded a wide degree of latitude and assistance with
    the conduct of his trial and that his fair trial rights were respected.  Related
    to this ground, the applicant complains that the Crown called a number of
    unnecessary witnesses with the result that his trial was unduly protracted.  However,
    the justice of the peace stated that the trial was protracted largely due
    to the inexperience and lack of legal training of the applicant.  Many of
    the Crown’s witnesses were called in order to rebut the applicant’s contention
    that there was a conspiracy between the Ministry of Transportation and the
    Ontario Provincial Police.  The justice of the peace was of the opinion that
    much of this evidence was of little assistance or not relevant to the real
    issues before the court and he had no hesitation in rejecting the applicant’s
    contention.  Moreover, the evidence of the Ministry of Transportation inspector
    was properly before the court and was admissible at the trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    relation to s. 11(c) of the <i>Charter</i>,<i> </i>the applicant was in no
    way legally compelled to testify and he did not testify. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor
    was the applicant tried or convicted for the same offences within the meaning
    of s. 11(h) of the <i>Charter</i>.  The sentencing proceedings indicate that
    counts one through seven inclusive concerned the HTA.
     The Crown did not seek an additional sentence in relation to these counts
    as the applicant had already been convicted of criminal negligence in another
    court in relation to the same incident and sentenced to a one year jail term
    and a five year driving prohibition.  Thus, the applicant was only sentenced
    on the CAIA counts. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    remaining grounds of appeal similarly have no arguable chance of success
    and do not require further comment. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    it is not essential in the public interest or for the due administration
    of justice that leave to appeal be granted. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion for leave to appeal is therefore dismissed.</p>
