  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Introduction</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    September 28, 2006, the appellant was convicted by Justice S. Ray of the
    Ontario Court of Justice on three counts of sexual assault, one count of
    assault, and one count of criminal harassment under ss. 271, 265, and 264
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  He was sentenced to imprisonment for three
    years, his name was added to the National Sex Offender Registry and a DNA
    sample was collected for the National DNA Data Bank.  He appeals from his
    convictions on the three counts of sexual assault and seeks leave to appeal
    and, if leave is granted, appeals his sentence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal and order a new trial.</p>
  <h3>Facts</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant and the complainant were married and had one child.  However, they
    were separated at the time the events giving rise to the charges occurred.  The
    complainant had moved out of the family home for a period of time to live
    with a friend, but had returned, with their child, to live at home until
    her new accommodation was ready.  There is controversy over whether the return
    home had a reconciliation aspect to it, but the complainant was adamant in
    her testimony that it did not.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant alleged that during the period April 1–16, 2005, the appellant – who
    was supposed to be sleeping on the couch – touched her vaginal area on two
    occasions while she was asleep with the child by her side in her bed (Counts
    1 and 3).  The appellant denied this ever happened.  The complainant also
    alleged that he forced her to have non-consensual sexual intercourse, on
    a third occasion, which resulted in her becoming pregnant (she subsequently
    had an abortion when she discovered she was pregnant) (Count 2).  The appellant
    insisted that this act of sexual intercourse was consensual and had been
    initiated by the complainant.  He said the complainant told him not to get
    excited, however, because it was not an act of reconciliation and that she
    still intended to move out.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    events giving rise to the assault charge (Count 4) occurred in June, 2005,
    on an occasion when the complainant was visiting her friend, Ms. M., who
    happened to live in the same building as the appellant at the time.  A confrontation
    admittedly occurred between the complainant and the appellant, the complainant
    was pushed and/or choked, her clothing was torn, and she was burned on the
    arm by a citronella candle which Ms. M. said was thrown at the complainant
    by the appellant during the altercation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Count
    5, the criminal harassment charge, was based on the appellant’s conduct towards
    the complainant throughout this entire period.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    the complainant and the appellant testified at trial.  They gave dramatically
    different versions of the events.  Ms. M. also testified with respect to
    the altercation that took place in her garden and, while there were some
    differences between her evidence and that of the complainant, her evidence
    more or less corroborated the complainant’s in relation to that event.  The
    central issue at trial was credibility.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the conclusion of the Crown’s case, after three days of trial, the appellant
    acknowledged that the Crown had made out its case with respect to the assault
    and criminal harassment charges.  His counsel led evidence briefly during
    the appellant’s testimony to establish the basis of these charges.  Without
    objection by the defence, Crown counsel nonetheless cross-examined the appellant
    vigorously with respect to his version of events relating to the assault
    charge and – as Mr. Skerkowski noted in his factum – “the appellant did not
    do well in cross-examination”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge convicted.  She did not believe the appellant, finding that his
    evidence was internally and externally inconsistent, non-sensical, changeable,
    and the product of an admittedly bad memory.  She believed the complainant,
    finding her evidence remarkably particular, non-embellished, unshaken in
    cross-examination, confirmed by the evidence of Ms. M. and not designed to
    put herself in a good light or the appellant in the worst possible light.  She
    concluded that the appellant’s evidence was totally incredible and that it
    did not leave her with a reasonable doubt.  The reasons did not address whether,
    nonetheless, there was anything in the evidence as a whole that would leave
    her with a reasonable doubt, the third step in the analysis called for by <i>R
    v. W.(D.)</i>, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742.</p>
  <h3>Analysis</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    behalf of the appellant, Mr. Di Luca attacks the trial judge’s decision on
    two general bases.  First, he submits that the trial judge failed to give
    adequate reasons to explain why she found the complainant credible and the
    appellant not.  Secondly, he argues that she failed to apply the <i>W. (D.)</i> test
    properly and subtly shifted the burden of proof to the defence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree that the appeal should be allowed for two reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    although the appellant had admitted that the Crown had proved the case against
    him on the assault charge arising out of the altercation in Ms. M.’s garden,
    the trial judge appears to have focused on that incident primarily and to
    have concluded that because she disbelieved the appellant in relation to
    it and he was guilty of assault, she also disbelieved him in relation to
    the sexual assault incidents and therefore, he must be guilty of them as
    well.  She devoted a disproportionate part of her 22-page decision the assault
    incident and her analysis of the evidence in relation to it.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    was open to the trial judge to consider her credibility findings with respect
    to the assault when addressing the credibility issues between the complainant
    and the appellant with respect to the sexual assault charges.  However, on
    the facts of this case – where the appellant’s credibility was assessed on
    counts where guilt was conceded and the disputed counts involved sexual conduct
    in significantly different circumstances – the credibility findings on one
    count cannot automatically be transferred to the other counts without at
    least some explanation by the trial judge as to why that consequence should
    follow.  There is no such explanation here.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Secondly,
    although the foregoing flaw might not be sufficient alone to warrant a new
    trial – since the difficult exercise of making credibility findings is generally
    the trial judge’s call – there are several important pieces of evidence that
    the trial judge either ignores in her reasons or treats in a fashion that
    makes no logical sense.  In combination with the overemphasis on the assault
    incident, these defects in her analysis make the sexual assault convictions
    unsafe to uphold, in my view.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    example, the trial judge gave little consideration to the evidence of a “love
    letter” that the complainant is alleged to have written to a former lover
    in

    .  In that letter, the complainant said some positive things about the appellant
    and suggested that the child she aborted may have been the child of the man

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant was confronted with the letter during cross-examination.  At
    first she acknowledged the letter, but the following day took the position
    that it was a forgery.  The trial judge dealt with the letter with these
    comments:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Crown suggests that the letter found by [the
    appellant] in [the complainant’s] purse is a red herring.  <i>The evidence
    falls short of showing whether it’s the one she wrote</i>.  She could easily
    have denied she wrote any letter at all, but she did admit that she did write
    one, it was just not that one. [Emphasis added]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    issue, however, was not whether the evidence proved the letter was hers.  The
    issue was whether the letter might raise a reasonable doubt in favour of
    the appellant.  The trial judge did not consider it in that light.  The letter
    contained the following remarks:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It took four years for me to forget all the bad
    things you did to me, that when I decided to marry the man that put up with
    me for two years and helped me live.  Even though he too hurt me to he [always]
    supported my decisions even though I did not treat him good all the time
    he still treated me good.  How could I have been good to someone when I had
    so much anger inside of me. Finally I was able to put all my memories of
    you behind me and go-on with my life with my husband and daughter (so you
    will know I was pregnant shortly after the marriage).</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I was pregnant and wasn’t sure if it was yours,
    I had to make a very difficult [decision], one that I imagined that would
    never happen, one that you did not support me whatsoever, it cost me $2,000
    to know if you were the father of the child.  <i>I’m almost sure that my
    husband is not the father.</i> … You will never know the pain someone feels
    when they go [through] an abortion … I realized I have a good husband thats
    been [through] everything with me and still he stands by my side. [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Apart
    from the positive references to the appellant, the references to the aborted
    child required an explanation.  The aborted child could not be the couple’s
    existing child (born shortly after the marriage), and the context of the
    second paragraph cited above is a trip that the complainant took to
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Portugal</st1:country-region>
    not long before the events in question. The letter suggests the appellant
    is not the father of the aborted child, whereas the complainant’s position
    at trial was that the non-consensual sexual intercourse had resulted in a
    pregnancy that she aborted.  This is a critical piece of evidence that the
    trial judge appears to have ignored.  We do not know whether she was satisfied
    it did not give rise to a reasonable doubt and, if not, why.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    in making her credibility determinations, the trial judge concluded that
    if “the alleged rape had happened in the manner suggested by [the appellant]
    and they had really reconciled, she would not have hastened her efforts to
    leave and continue with the original plan of moving out.”  That conclusion
    may have been open to her.  However, the appellant’s evidence was that after
    what he described as a consensual act of sex, the complainant had told him
    not to get excited because the sex did not mean anything and she did not
    want to fall in love with him again.  The trial judge gave no consideration
    to this evidence, which is entirely consistent with a consensual act of momentary
    physical pleasure and the complainant still pursuing her plans to move.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the trial judge’s treatment of the complainant’s sudden allegation during
    her testimony at trial of a fourth incident of sexual impropriety – not revealed
    to anyone before – is perplexing at least.  According to the complainant,
    this fourth incident was the most recent, and the one that triggered her
    reporting of the events leading to the charges.  It formed what appears to
    have been for the trial judge the central example of the complainant’s restraint
    in not embellishing her testimony.  Instead of being a factor that might
    undermine the complainant’s credibility, it became a positive factor underpinning
    it.  I do not understand the logic of this treatment.  The trial judge’s
    finding that the complainant was “restrained and did not take advantage of
    golden opportunities to embellish” her testimony was a key factor in her
    credibility findings in favour of the complainant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    trial judge is not required to refer to every piece of evidence in explaining
    his or her reasons.  But where the reasons fail to set out the path explaining
    and justifying the trial judge’s conclusions regarding credibility and suggest
    a failure to address, or a misapprehension of, important pieces of evidence
    in her reasons, a new trial is warranted.  Here, the foregoing factors, when
    taken together, lead to such a result.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is particularly so where it appears – as it does here – that the trial judge
    may not have followed the proper <i>W. (D.) </i>analysis.  The trial judge
    disbelieved the appellant.  She found that his evidence did not raise a reasonable
    doubt in her mind.  But she did not consider whether, on all of the evidence
    that she did accept, there was a reasonable doubt as to the appellant’s guilt
    on the sexual assault charges.  Had she done so, and had she considered the
    evidentiary matters outlined above in that context, the result might have
    been different.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    new trial on the sexual assault charges must be ordered.</p>
  <h3>Sentence</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown fairly concedes that, if the conviction appeal on the sexual assault
    charges is allowed, the sentence of 3 years imposed by the trial judge is
    not warranted for the assault and criminal harassment charges.  Mr. Di Luca
    suggested a sentence of 30 days would be appropriate in such circumstances.  Mr.
    Skerkowski suggested 4-6 months.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant has served a period of 3 months.  In my view a sentence of time
    served for the assault and criminal harassment charges is appropriate in
    the circumstances.</p>
  <h3>Disposition </h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would therefore allow the conviction appeal and order a new trial on Counts
    1, 2 and 3, and as well set aside the order adding the appellant’s name to
    the National Sex Registry and requiring a DNA sample.  I would grant leave
    to appeal sentence and allow the appeal by substituting a sentence of 3 months
    imprisonment on counts 4 and 5, concurrent.  </p>
