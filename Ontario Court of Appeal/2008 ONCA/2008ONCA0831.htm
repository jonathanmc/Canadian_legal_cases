style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent, Roger McGregor, was convicted of one count of aggravated sexual
    assault arising from two instances of unprotected sexual intercourse with
    his girlfriend, M.M., at a time when, unbeknownst to M.M., the respondent
    was HIV-positive.  He was sentenced to a one-year conditional sentence to
    be served in the community on terms of strict house arrest, followed by three
    years probation.  The Crown seeks leave to appeal sentence and, if leave
    be granted, appeals against sentence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown argues that the sentencing judge erred: (i) by imposing a sentence
    that fails to reflect the gravity of the offence and which is manifestly
    unfit; (ii) by failing to adhere to the range of sentences established in
    similar cases; and (iii) by failing to impose a sentence that gives proper
    effect to the principles of general deterrence and denunciation.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    the reasons that follow, I conclude that the sentencing judge erred in her
    approach to sentencing and that the sentence imposed is demonstrably unfit.  Accordingly,
    I would grant leave to appeal sentence, set aside the conditional sentence
    imposed by the sentencing judge, and substitute in its stead a custodial
    sentence of one-year imprisonment, followed by three years
    probation. </p>
  <h2>I.          Facts</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    the time of trial, the respondent was 34 years of age.  When he was 19 years
    old, he was diagnosed HIV-positive.  To date, he has not developed any symptoms
    of AIDS.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Following
    his diagnosis, the respondent received medical treatment.  On several occasions,
    including in December 2004 when his relationship with M.M. was in progress,
    he was warned by a public health nurse of his obligation to inform all prospective
    sexual partners of his HIV-positive status and instructed to always use a
    condom when he engaged in sexual intercourse.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent and M.M. were involved in a relationship from the fall of 2004
    until the spring of 2006.  During this period, they saw each other almost
    daily and frequently engaged in sexual intercourse.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although
    the respondent was usually careful to use a condom when having intercourse
    with M.M., on two occasions he failed to use a condom or any other means
    of protection against the transmittal of sexually-communicable diseases.  These
    two instances of unprotected sexual intercourse with M.M. gave rise to the
    predicate offence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    no time during their relationship did the respondent disclose to M.M. that
    he was HIV-positive.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Instead,
    M.M. discovered the respondents HIV-positive status by accident, when she
    found a medication information sheet on the respondents dresser in his bedroom.  She
    took the information sheet to a pharmacist and inquired about the purpose
    of the medication.  She was informed by the pharmacist that the drug in question
    was used to treat HIV.  M.M. immediately confronted the respondent with this
    alarming information and an altercation ensued.  Shortly thereafter, the
    relationship between the respondent and M.M. came to an abrupt halt.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>M.M.
    consulted her family physician and underwent a series of tests to determine
    whether she had contracted HIV.  Understandably, this was a period of great
    stress and anxiety for M.M.  Fortunately, to date, she has not tested positive
    for HIV.</p>
  <h2>II.        The Charges and the Trial</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent was charged with one count each of aggravated sexual assault,
    assault and unlawful confinement.  The latter two charges related to the
    altercation that occurred between the respondent and M.M. when M.M. learned
    that the respondent was HIV-positive.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    February 22, 2008, after a four-day trial, the respondent was found guilty
    of aggravated sexual assault.  He was acquitted of the remaining two charges.  On
    May 16, 2008, the respondent was sentenced to a one-year conditional sentence,
    subject to terms of strict house arrest, plus three years probation.  The
    sentencing judge also granted a DNA database order against the respondent
    and ordered that he comply with the <i>Sex Offender Information Registration
    Act</i>, S.C. 2004, c. 10 pursuant to s. 490.012 of the <i>Criminal Code
    of Canada</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 (the Code).  </p>

    the sentencing hearing, the Crown argued that the respondents conduct was
    wanton, reckless, self-indulgent, calculated, cavalier, wilful and deliberate.  In
    light of this conduct, the Crown submitted that a sentence of two years
    imprisonment, followed by three years probation, was appropriate.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    defence submitted that a three to six-months conditional sentence, followed
    by 18 months probation, was a fit sentence.  In support of this submission,
    the defence emphasized that the respondent has no prior criminal record;
    that unprotected sexual intercourse between the respondent and M.M. occurred
    on only two occasions; that no force or violence was employed; and that there
    was no evidence of any pattern of sexual aggression by the respondent.  The
    defence also argued that the acts in question were neither planned nor deliberate
    and stressed that the respondent himself is the victim of a horrendous disease
    with which he must contend on a daily basis.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    sentencing judge was alert to the serious nature of the offence.  She held
    that the respondent had been deceitful, that he had deliberately failed to
    tell M.M. about his HIV-positive status, that his failure to use protection
    during intercourse on the two occasions at issue would expose his partner
    to the risk of a death sentence by this pernicious disease, and that it
    was only by great good fortune that M.M. was spared HIV.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    the sentencing judge also accepted many aspects of the defence characterization
    of the respondents conduct.  In particular, she distinguished this case
    from those cases in which jail terms have been imposed on offenders for engaging
    in sexual intercourse without disclosing their HIV-positive status to their
    unsuspecting partners.  In the trial judges view, those cases differ from
    this case because they involved one or more of the following factors: (i)
    cavalier, callous, wanton, predatory or uncaring conduct by the offender;
    (ii) more than one victim; (iii) the victims contracted HIV; and (iv) conduct
    by the offender that was calculated solely to obtain sexual partners and
    to satisfy sexual appetites regardless of the risk or cost to others.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    sentencing judge also noted as other mitigating factors: (i) the absence
    of any specific planning or deliberation in the respondents offence; (ii)
    the respondent had been on bail pending sentence without incident; (iii)
    the author of the respondents pre-sentence report considered him to be a
    suitable candidate for a term of community supervision; (iv) the chance of
    the respondent reoffending was low; and (v) M.M. herself, as well as other
    witnesses, testified as to the respondents good character.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the end, having weighed those factors that she regarded as aggravating against
    those she viewed as mitigating, the sentencing judge concluded:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In my view, a sentence of 12 months to be served
    in the community under strict conditions, followed by three years supervised
    probation, would not pose any risk to public safety, would express to an
    appropriate degree societys denunciation of this conduct, and would otherwise
    be in keeping with the fundamental principles of sentencing and justice.</p>
  <h2>IV.       Issues</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(1)       Does the sentence imposed give proper
    effect to the principles of general deterrence and denunciation?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(2)       Does the sentence imposed fail to reflect

  <h2>V.        Analysis</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    appeal must proceed on the basis that the disposition of a sentencing judge
    attracts a high degree of deference from a reviewing court: <i>R. v. Shropshire</i>,
    [1995] 4 S.C.R. 227, at paras. 46-49.  Unless the sentencing judge made an
    error in principle, failed to consider evidence relevant to sentence, misapprehended
    a material fact, or imposed a sentence that is demonstrably unfit, appellate
    interference with the sentence imposed is precluded: <i>R. v. M.(

    <st1:place w:st="on">

    ), at paras. 30-31.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>With
    respect, I conclude that the sentencing judge in this case erred in her approach
    to sentencing and that the conditional sentence imposed by her is demonstrably
    unfit.  I reach this conclusion for the following reasons.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To
    begin, it is common ground that at the time of the respondents sentencing
    hearing, a conditional sentence of imprisonment was available under s. 742.1
    of the Code for the offence of aggravated sexual assault if the statutory
    prerequisites to such a sentence were met: see for example, <i>R. v. Wismayer</i> (1997),
    33 O.R. (3d) 225 (C.A.).<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this case, the statutory prerequisites to the imposition of a conditional
    sentence set out under s. 742.1 of the Code were satisfied: (i) no minimum
    term of imprisonment applies to the offence in question; (ii) the sentence
    imposed was less than two years imprisonment; and (iii) the sentencing judge
    was satisfied that the safety of the community would not be endangered by
    the respondent serving his sentence in the community.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    controversy, therefore, was whether a conditional sentence would satisfy
    the fundamental purpose, principles and objectives of sentencing set out
    in ss. 718 to 718.2 of the Code in the circumstances of this case.  The determination
    of this issue required the sentencing judge to undertake a comprehensive
    review of those principles and objectives in order to assess, among other
    matters, whether the respondent should serve his sentence in the community
    or in jail: <i>R. v. Wells</i>, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 207, at para. 29; <i>Wismayer</i>,
    at p. 236.</p>
  <h2><i>Denunciation and Deterrence</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    the sentencing judge correctly noted, denunciation and deterrence are the
    primary sentencing objectives in this case.  In <i>R. v. Cuerrier</i>, [1998]
    2 S.C.R. 371, Cory J., writing for a majority of the Supreme Court of Canada,
    emphasized the importance of denunciation and deterrence in HIV-assault cases.  He
    put it this way, at paras. 141-142:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[T]he criminal law does have a role to play both
    in deterring those infected with HIV from putting the lives of others at
    risk and in protecting the public from irresponsible individuals who refuse
    to comply with public health orders to abstain from high-risk activities.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Where public health endeavours fail to provide adequate
    protection to individuals like the complainants, the criminal law can be
    effective.  It provides a needed measure of protection in the form of deterrence
    and reflects societys abhorrence of the self-centered recklessness and the
    callous insensitivity of the actions of the respondent and those who have
    acted in a similar manner.  The risk of infection and death of partners of
    HIV-positive individuals is a cruel and ever present reality.  Indeed the
    potentially fatal consequences are far more invidious and graver than many
    other actions prohibited by the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  The risks of infection
    are so devastating that there is a real and urgent need to provide a measure
    of protection for those in the position of the complainants.  If ever there
    was a place for the deterrence provided by criminal sanctions it is present
    in these circumstances.  It may well have the desired effect of ensuring
    that there is disclosure of the risk and that appropriate precautions are
    taken.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    some cases, an appropriately crafted conditional sentence may satisfy the
    principles of denunciation and deterrence: <i>R. v. Proulx</i>, [2000] 1
    S.C.R. 61, at paras. 102 and 107.  However, in <i>Proulx</i>, at para. 106,
    Lamer C.J. pointed out that: there may be certain circumstances in which
    the need for denunciation [or deterrence] is so pressing that incarceration
    will be the only suitable way in which to express societys condemnation
    of the offenders conduct.  In other words, the nature of the offence or
    the circumstances of the offender may require a term of actual incarceration
    to adequately express societys condemnation of the conduct at issue or to
    achieve the required deterrent effect.  In my opinion, this is such a case.</p>
  <h2><i>Gravity of the Offence</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section
    718.1 of the Code provides that: A sentence must be proportionate to the
    gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender.  This
    direction requires that, in fashioning an appropriate sentence, a sentencing
    judge have regard to both the seriousness of the offence and the offenders
    degree of responsibility.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondents crime was very serious.  On the sentencing judges findings,
    the respondent deliberately refrained from disclosing his HIV-positive status
    to M.M. for approximately a year and a half, notwithstanding that he knew
    that he was obliged to do so before engaging in sexual intercourse with her
    and despite prior explicit warnings to him of his disclosure obligation by
    public health authorities.  In <i>Cuerrier</i>, Cory J. commented<i> </i>at
    para. 126: The possible consequence of engaging in unprotected inter-course
    with an HIV-positive partner is death.  In these circumstances, there can
    be no basis for distinguishing between lies and a deliberate failure to disclose.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>By
    failing to tell M.M. of his HIV-positive status, the respondent deceived
    M.M. throughout their entire relationship concerning a medical condition
    that could expose her to a life-threatening illness.  Then, on two separate
    occasions of unprotected sexual intercourse, when the respondent knew that
    the risk to M.M. of contracting HIV was heightened by his failure to use
    a condom, he again blithely failed to tell her that he was HIV-positive.  The
    sentencing judge observed: There is little to be said that can leaven the
    gravity of this offence. I agree.</p>
  <h2>                        <i>Abuse of Trust</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section
    718.2(a)(iii) of the Code provides that the abuse of a position of trust
    in the commission of an offence is an aggravating circumstance on sentencing.  The
    respondent did not occupy a traditional position of trust in relation to
    M.M.  However, any intimate relationship of the type entered into by the
    respondent with M.M. is based on a certain amount of trust and confidence,
    at least to the extent that each participant may reasonably expect that he
    or she will not knowingly be exposed by the other to a dangerous contagious
    disease: see for example, <i>Cuerrier</i> at para. 119.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent was M.M.s boyfriend.  For the full duration of their 18-month
    relationship, he withheld from M.M. information vital to her health and well-being.  On
    two occasions when a clear and real potential for M.M.s exposure to HIV
    existed, the respondent continued his pattern of deception by failing to
    inform M.M. of his HIV-positive status.  In so doing, the respondent breached
    that element of trust that formed the basis of his relationship with M.M.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondents non-disclosure of his HIV-positive status meant that M.M. was
    essentially duped, for a prolonged period, into having sexual relations with
    the respondent.  The respondents failure to disclose that he had HIV vitiated
    M.M.s consent to sexual intercourse with him.  In <i>Cuerrier</i>, at para.
    127, the Supreme Court of
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    bluntly warned: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Without disclosure of HIV status there cannot be
    a true consent.  The consent cannot simply be to have sexual intercourse.  Rather,
    it must be consent to have intercourse with a partner who is HIV-positive.  True
    consent cannot be given if there has not been a disclosure by the accused
    of his HIV-positive status.  A consent that is not based upon knowledge of
    the significant relevant factors is not a valid consent.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Viewed
    in this light, the respondent knowingly engaged in a lengthy pattern of non-consensual
    sex with M.M., animated throughout by a fundamental breach of trust that
    culminated in two instances of high risk unprotected sexual intercourse.  Despite
    her otherwise clear and thorough reasons, the sentencing judge made no mention
    of the respondents continuing breach of trust and the non-consensual nature
    of the sexual acts in question.  With respect, this was an error.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    note that the sentencing judge found as a fact that: Had [M.M.] known from
    the outset about McGregors HIV status, she never would have engaged, however
    infrequently it may have been, in unprotected sexual intercourse.  One might
    also ask whether, if she had known that the respondent was HIV-positive,
    M.M. would have engaged in sexual intercourse with him at all: condoms sometimes
    fail.  That choice, which was hers to make, was denied to M.M. by the respondents
    deliberate decision to ignore his obligation to disclose his HIV-positive
    status to her.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Later
    in her reasons, the sentencing judge quoted the following statement in <i>R.
    v. Williams</i>, 2006 ONCJ 484, at para. 20: There is no settled view as
    to the appropriate tariff other than that a period of true imprisonment is

style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although
    the sentencing judge thus properly directed herself that a custodial sentence
    is usually required in the circumstances of the offence committed by the
    respondent, she suggested that the above-quoted observation in <i>Williams</i>  that a
    period of true imprisonment is consistently imposed in cases involving HIV-positive
    offenders who knowingly engage in unprotected sexual intercourse  is at
    odds to some extent with the decision in <i>R. v. J.M.</i>, [2005] O.J.
    No. 5649 (S.C.).  She also relied on <i>R. v. Lamirande</i> (2006), 205
    <st1:State

    <st1:place w:st="on">

    ) for the proposition that denunciation and deterrence could be achieved
    in an HIV-assault case by a suitably restrictive conditional sentence.  In
    so doing, in my opinion, the sentencing judge erred in her appreciation of <i>J.M. </i>and<i> Lamirande</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    it is true that the authorities reflect a wide range of sentences in cases
    involving sexual intercourse and the non-disclosure of HIV-positive status,
    absent a guilty plea by the involved offender or a joint submission on sentencing,
    the sentences imposed involve actual incarceration of some duration.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>J.M.</i>,
    the sentencing judge accepted a joint submission for a 12-month conditional
    sentence, in addition to three years probation, in respect of an HIV-positive
    offender who pleaded guilty to two counts of aggravated sexual assault.  The
    offender in <i>J.M.</i> suffered from a significant psychiatric illness resulting
    from her HIV infection, which contributed to her risk-taking behaviours.  She
    had also served nine months pre-trial custody.  That is not this case in
    any salient respect.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Similarly, <i>Lamirande</i> was
    a plea bargain case in which an HIV-positive offender pled guilty to aggravated
    assault on the basis of a negotiated joint recommendation for a conditional
    sentence of two years less a day.  That, too, is not this case.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent has been unable to point to any case where, absent a joint submission
    on sentence and/or a guilty plea, a conditional sentence was imposed on an
    accused convicted of aggravated sexual assault for engaging in unprotected
    sexual intercourse without first disclosing his or her HIV-positive status.  The
    dearth of authority in support of the approach to sentencing taken by the
    sentencing judge in this case confirms that aggravated sexual assault of
    the type at issue here will generally compel a custodial term of imprisonment.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    conclude, therefore, that the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge did
    not accord with the requirements of s. 718.2(b) of the Code: the sentence
    was outside the range of established sentences imposed on similar offenders
    for similar offences.  As a conditional sentence, even a conditional sentence
    that included strict terms of house arrest, was clearly an inappropriate
    disposition on the facts of this case, it follows that it was demonstrably
    unfit.</p>
  <h2>VI.       Disposition</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span

    I accept the sentencing judges findings that the respondents actions were
    not wanton or calculated and that no specific planning, deliberation or wilful
    intent to expose M.M. to the risk of HIV was involved on the two occasions
    of unprotected sexual intercourse that gave rise to the predicate offence.  Nor,
    on the facts as found by the sentencing judge, did the respondent engage
    in a pattern of violent or predatory behaviour.  There was also evidence
    at trial, including from M.M. herself, of the respondents general good character.  These
    factors militate in favour of the imposition of a jail term at the lower

    approximately six months of his conditional sentence of imprisonment.  In
    my view, the custodial sentence to be imposed on the respondent should be
    discounted by crediting him, on approximately a 1:1 ratio, for his pre-sentence
    custody and for that part of the conditional sentence that he has served.  On
    the facts of this case, I see no reason why the imposition of the respondents
    custodial sentence should be stayed, nor any reason why the respondent should
    receive any greater credit than the actual time served by him to date: see <i>R.
    v. F. (G.C.)</i> (2004), 71 O.R. (3d) 771 (C.A.).</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly,
    I would grant leave to appeal sentence, set aside the conditional sentence
    imposed by the trial judge, and substitute in its stead a custodial sentence
    of 18 months imprisonment, reduced by six months for time served by the respondent
    both prior to sentencing and under his conditional sentence.  In the result,
    I would impose a custodial sentence of 12 months, to commence on the day
    that the respondent surrenders, followed by three years probation.  He is
    to surrender three days after the date of these reasons, failing which a
    warrant shall issue for his arrest.  In all other respects, the sentence
    imposed by the sentencing judge will remain the same. </p>
