    appellant, Peter Misheal, appeals the following two orders in this family
    law case: (i) the order of Baltman J. of the Superior Court of Justice dated
    July 23, 2008, dismissing the appellant’s motion to vary the support provisions
    of the trial judgment of Coats J. of the Superior Court of Justice dated
    March 13, 2007 based on an alleged material change in circumstances and to
    stay enforcement of support arrears by the Family Responsibility Office (the “FRO”)
    (the “Variation Order”); and (ii) that part of the order of Miller J. of
    the Superior Court of Justice dated November 22, 2007 directing that certain
    net proceeds of sale relating to the disposition of real property located
    on Argus Road in Oakville be paid to the FRO, by no later than December 3,
    2007, on account of support arrears in the sum of $121,686.18 (the “Arrears
    Order”).  The respondent, Mona Okel, resists both appeals.  Before this court,
    both parties are self-represented. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    our view, for the reasons that follow, both appeals must be dismissed.</p>
  <h2>(1)       Preliminary Procedural Matter: Adjournment Request</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    December 1, 2008, this court received correspondence from one Jodi Hutchinson
    who claimed to be the sole shareholder of Zoned Use Property Inc. (“Zoned
    Use”), the apparent owner of the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Oakville property above-described.  Ms. Hutchinson requested that the appeal
    from the Arrears Order be adjourned to permit Zoned Use to obtain legal counsel
    and to participate in the appeal because the Arrears Order was allegedly “levied
    against the company [Zoned Use] which owes no debt to Ms. Okel [the respondent].”  Ms.
    Hutchinson stated that she was seeking legal advice and counsel to represent
    Zoned Use on the appeal, that she resides in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Halifax and that, to date, Zoned Use has been unable to obtain counsel.  Ms.
    Hutchinson’s adjournment request did not appear to have been copied by her
    to the parties.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    response to her correspondence, Ms. Hutchinson was informed by court staff
    that unless an earlier conference call motion for an adjournment was arranged
    on notice to all parties, it would be necessary for her, or for an agent
    on behalf of Zoned Use, to attend before the Panel on December 3, 2008 to
    request standing on the appeal and an adjournment of it.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms.
    Hutchinson did not attend before this court on December 3, 2008 when argument
    of the appeal from the Arrears Order was scheduled to commence.  Nor did
    Ms. Hutchinson or Zoned Use make any effort to schedule an earlier motion
    by conference call to request an adjournment of the appeal.  However, at
    the outset of oral argument, the appellant requested an adjournment of the
    appeal on behalf of Zoned Use.  In so doing, he stated that he had initiated
    the appeal from the Arrears Order “on behalf of ” Zoned Use because the Arrears
    Order affected that company, that he had no connection with Zoned Use, and
    that the Arrears Order had been made against Zoned Use although that company
    did not participate in the motion before Miller J.  The respondent opposed
    the appellant’s adjournment request.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    rejected this adjournment request for several reasons.  First, Zoned Use
    is not a party to the appeal from the Arrears Order.  Second, Ms. Hutchinson’s
    communication of December 1, 2008 appears to have been the first contact
    by her with this court in respect of the appeal, notwithstanding that the
    appeal was initiated almost one year ago.  Third, the appeal concerns the
    enforcement by the FRO of support arrears owed by the appellant to the respondent.  As
    we explain below, the appellant was represented by an agent during the proceeding
    before Miller J. and agreed to that part of the Arrears Order that the appellant
    now seeks to challenge.  Finally, contrary to the appellant’s assertion,
    the record indicates that Zoned Use is a company owned or controlled by him.  In
    her reasons in support of her trial judgment dated March 13, 2007, the trial
    judge (Coats J. of the Superior Court of Justice) found that Zoned Use is
    owned by the appellant.  Moreover, the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Oakville property, and the business operated on it, formed part of the assets
    in dispute at trial and the appellant listed the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Oakville property as part of his assets on his net family property statement,
    filed at trial.</p>
  <h2>(2)       Appeal from the Variation Order</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    parties were married on October 6, 1985, and separated in February 2002.  There
    are three children of the marriage: Anna, born August 2, 1986; Theodore,
    born July 10, 1988; and Chantelle, born March 22, 1991.  The respondent has
    sole custody of the three children.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    March 13, 2007, following an 18-day trial, the trial judge ordered the appellant
    to pay child support for Theodore and Chantelle in the amount of $1,644 per
    month and spousal support in the amount of $2,000 per month, based on the
    appellant’s imputed annual gross income of $120,000.  The appellant appealed
    to this court from the trial judge’s decision.  That appeal is still pending.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant also moved to vary the support awards made by the trial judge on
    the basis of an alleged material change in circumstances.  By order dated
    January 10, 2008, this first motion to vary was dismissed by Murray J. of
    the Superior Court of Justice.  The appellant’s appeal to this court from
    that order was dismissed on October 3, 2008.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    dismissing the appellant’s appeal from Murray J.’s order, this court indicated
    its agreement with the motion judge that the material filed by the appellant
    in support of his motion to vary failed to disclose a change in circumstances.  As
    well, the appellant had failed to comply with rule 15(7) of the <i>Family
    Law Rules</i> regarding financial statements.  The respondent was awarded
    her costs of the appeal, fixed in the total amount of $500.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Only
    one month after the dismissal of the appellant’s first variation motion,
    and while the appellant’s appeal from that dismissal was still pending, the
    appellant brought a second identical variation motion, again seeking to vary
    the trial judge’s disposition regarding support based on an alleged material
    change in circumstances.  The appellant alleged that this second variation
    motion was based on facts that differed from those that had been before Murray
    J.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    second variation motion was adjourned by order of M.G.J. Quigley J. of the
    Superior Court of Justice dated March 26, 2008, and rescheduled to be heard
    on June 30, 2008.  It was then adjourned a second time by order of Fragomeni
    J. of the Superior Court of Justice dated June 30, 2008, and rescheduled
    to be heard on July 23, 2008.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When
    the matter eventually proceeded before Baltman J. of the Superior Court of
    Justice on July 23, 2008, the appellant’s motion was dismissed in its entirety,
    in part on the basis that it was an abuse of process.  The motion judge stated: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The husband currently has 4 (four) outstanding appeals,
    all arising out of the same matters dealt with by Coats, J.  He has already
    brought a motion to vary Coats J.’s judgment which was dismissed by Murray
    J., on January 10, 2008 (in part because there was no evidence of a change
    in circumstances) which is now under appeal.  The husband brought a motion
    before the Ontario Court of Appeal on June 5, 2008 to stay the support payments
    pending appeal of Coats J.’s judgment, which was dismissed.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>While in theory the husband has the right to move
    to vary upon a material change, we cannot on any whim reinstigate proceedings
    that are essentially identical to ones he has recently lost and has under
    appeal.  The husband is essentially trying to relitigate the motion already
    dismissed by Murray J., relying upon what is in my view the identical grounds
    and essentially the same evidence or at least evidence that could or should
    have been raised previously.  This violates what Arbour J., calls the “principles
    of judicial economy, consistency, finality and the integrity of the administration
    of justice”:
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    <i>Toronto</i><i> v. CUPE Local 79</i>, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 77, at paras. 35-55.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    agree with this conclusion and with the motion judge’s reasoning in support
    of it.  The appellant’s second variation motion was an effort to relitigate
    an issue already adjudicated by Murray J.  As we have said, the appellant’s
    appeal from the order of Murray J. was dismissed by this court.  The appellant
    now attempts to renew before this court the same arguments considered and
    rejected by Baltman J., based on essentially the same evidence and grounds
    for variation unsuccessfully advanced before Murray J.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant claims that Baltman J. erred by proceeding to determine his second
    variation motion on the merits when the purpose of the attendance before
    the motion judge was to resolve the preliminary issue whether the court had
    jurisdiction to entertain such a variation motion while the appellant’s appeal
    from the trial judgment, which fixed the support awards in issue, was outstanding.  The
    appellant complains that the motion judge failed to consider the jurisdictional
    question, as illustrated by her failure to mention it in her reasons.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    disagree.  It is implicit in the motion judge’s reasons – including, in particular,
    in her review of the recent history of these proceedings – that she considered
    and rejected the proposition that the court lacked jurisdiction to entertain
    a support variation motion while the main appeal from the trial judgment
    remained outstanding.  For that reason, the motion judge dealt with the motion
    on the merits, taking into account the submissions of the parties.  She made
    no error in so doing.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    conclude, therefore, that there is no basis for appellate interference with
    the Variation Order.</p>
  <h2>(3)       Appeal from the Arrears Order</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant’s challenge to the Arrears Order is also unsustainable.  He makes
    three complaints.  First, he argues that he was precluded from “meeting the
    case put forward by the respondent as the respondent did not put forward
    any case”.  Second, he submits that there was no basis for the writ of seizure
    and sale in the first place and that the issuance of the writ was the result
    of administrative error.  Finally, he claims that there was no evidence before
    the court supporting an order securing amounts for support.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    is no merit to these submissions.  The Arrears Order vacated the charging
    order on the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Oakville property.  Any complaint regarding the events leading up to the
    charging order were addressed by the order vacating it.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    contrary to the appellant’s contention, there was uncontroverted evidence
    before the motion judge establishing the arrears of support owed by the appellant
    as at the date of the Arrears Order.  The transcript of the proceeding indicates
    that the respondent filed materials outlining her calculations of the outstanding
    support payments owed by the appellant.  The motion judge also had the benefit
    of a sworn affidavit setting out the FRO’s calculations of the child and
    spousal support arrears owed as at the end of November 2007.  In addition,
    the appellant’s agent acknowledged to the motion judge that the FRO’s calculations
    were correct, that the arrears in question totalled $121,686.18, and that
    the net funds realized on the disposition of the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Oakville property were “more than sufficient” to cover the support arrears.  Indeed,
    he stated: “The total that’s owing.  It’s incontrovertible”.  </p>

    the transcript suggests that the appellant did not oppose the Arrears Order.  Rather,
    his concern was to obtain an order vacating the charging order to permit
    the sale of the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Oakville property, other than under distress conditions.  This order was
    granted, at the request of the appellant’s agent, on condition that the support
    arrears be paid to the FRO from the net proceeds of sale.</p>

    of disbursements and G.S.T., payable by the appellant forthwith.</p>
