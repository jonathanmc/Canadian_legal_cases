    central issue on this appeal is whether Crown counsel’s closing address to
    the jury violated the prohibition in s. 4(6) of the <i>Canada Evidence Act</i>,
    R.S.C. 1985, c. C-5 against commenting on the failure of the accused to testify. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was charged with sexual assault.  He did not testify.  The key
    issues at trial were consent and the complainant’s credibility.  The defence
    position was that any sexual contact that occurred had either been consensual
    or based upon the appellant’s reasonable belief that the complainant was
    consenting.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his closing address to the jury, Crown counsel stated at the outset that
    the jury ought not to be “mesmerized” by the concept of reasonable doubt
    and that “reasonable doubt” did not mean “a speculative doubt conjured up
    by a timid juror to escape his or her duty.”  Then, after twice observing
    that the complainant’s evidence stood uncontradicted, Crown counsel stated
    in reference to the accused’s belief in consent: “But he didn’t testify,
    so he can’t be asked directly what he thought at the time or what he construed
    or what he knew.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, I am of the view that the Crown’s closing address,
    read as a whole, violated both the letter and the spirit of s. 4(6) of the <i>Canada
    Evidence Act</i> and that a new trial should be ordered.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>FACTS </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant was a 35 year-old developmentally challenged woman who lived
    in a group home.  After she met the appellant, they went on a few dates.  On
    the second date they kissed.  The appellant began to touch her but she stopped
    him and the date ended.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant testified that on their third date, the appellant took her to
    a secluded area at a beach.  He took out a blanket, and they sat down and
    began to kiss.  The complainant testified that she was comfortable to kiss
    and cuddle with the appellant, but no more.  The appellant, however, began
    to pull down her pants and touch her vagina with his fingers.  She said “no” and
    the appellant became angry.  He then put her hand on his penis.  The complainant
    protested and the appellant chided her.  A fisherman then appeared and agreed
    to give the appellant and complainant a ride to the street where the complainant’s
    group home was located. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant and complainant then walked to a park adjacent to the group home.
    They eventually sat down on the blanket.  The appellant began to kiss the
    complainant. He got on top of her and started to remove her top, pants and
    underwear.  She repeatedly said “no” but the appellant became angry, cursed
    at her and continued to force himself on her.  The complainant was lying
    on her back.  Her legs were up and her pants were down when the appellant
    allegedly penetrated her.  The complainant attempted to push the appellant
    off but he was too heavy.  When the sexual contact ended, the appellant walked
    the complainant home.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant testified in examination-in-chief that the appellant ignored
    her repeated demands for him to desist in his sexual advances. However, under
    cross-examination she stated that when she protested, the appellant “would
    get off and then he would get mad at me but then he would go back and do
    it again.”  However, later she stated that it was not the case that the appellant
    would desist each time she said “no”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant explained that she went with the appellant to the park after
    the beach incident because she was scared, in shock, and that she did not
    know what was going on.  She agreed that the appellant did not threaten her
    at any time, and did not force her to accompany him to the park.  When asked
    whether she invited the appellant to cuddle with her after each time she
    told him to get off, the complainant responded that it was a blur and that
    she could not remember.  The complainant’s evidence that she experienced
    vaginal bleeding after the incident was not corroborated by the evidence
    of the nurse who treated her.  Finally, the complainant acknowledged that
    she had her cell phone with her that night and that she did not call for
    help at any time. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s DNA was found in saliva on the complainant’s underpants. As previously
    stated, his position at trial was that sexual contact was consensual or based
    on his reasonable belief that the complainant was consenting.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown
    counsel made the following statements in his closing address:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Do not get mesmerized by reasonable doubt, as the
    concept does not grow larger the more times it is actually stated…. Please
    remember that the phrase is ‘reasonable doubt.’  And I emphasize the word ‘reasonable,’ which
    is a real, genuine doubt on the evidence based on reason; <i>not a speculative
    doubt conjured up by a timid juror to escape his or her duty.</i></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>If you believe the accused is probably guilty or
    likely guilty, that is not sufficient.  In those circumstances, you must
    give the benefit of the doubt to the accused and acquit, because I have failed
    to satisfy you of the guilt of [the accused] beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:
center'>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>As I’ve touched on already, and I’ll now repeat,
    at the heart of your responsibility in the jury room will be the task of
    deciding what weight you give to [the complainant’s] evidence.  <i>There
    is no other evidence before you, none, of an alternate version of what happened
    that night.  Just [the complainant’s].</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:
center'>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I would suggest to you that there can really be
    no doubt that she didn’t consent.  <i>The only evidence you have to hear,
    or the only evidence you’ve heard on that point, was what she told you….
    There is no evidence before you of anything that would suggest she consented.</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:
center'>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>You will also be told that you must decide whether
    I have proven that [the accused] knew she wasn’t consenting.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Now, that may present a problem, because you need
    to figure out what his knowledge was as to whether or not she was consenting.  <i>But
    he didn’t testify, so he can’t be asked directly what he thought at the time
    or what he construed or what he knew.  </i>But we can infer his state of
    mind. [Emphasis added.] </p>
  <h3>Trial Judge’s Ruling</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Immediately
    upon the completion of the Crown’s closing address, the appellant’s trial
    counsel applied for a mistrial on the ground that the remarks in the address
    amounted to an invitation to the jury to draw an adverse inference from the
    fact that the accused did not testify, contrary to s. 4(6) of the <i>Canada
    Evidence Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge dismissed the application for a mistrial.  Relying on <i>R. v.
    Knox</i> (2006), 80 O.R. (3d) 515 (C.A.), he held that while the remarks
    of Crown counsel were “regrettable” and
    “objectionable”, they did not go so far as to suggest to the jury that the
    accused’s silence could be used as evidence of guilt and did not give rise
    to a miscarriage of justice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the trial judge’s charge to the jury, he stated: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Because accused persons are not required to prove
    their innocence, they are not obliged to testify or to present evidence.  It
    is Crown counsel’s job to prove the charge beyond a reasonable doubt.  This
    rule never changes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    its deliberations, the jury asked the following questions:</p>
  <p>In regard to making our decision: </p>
  <p>What is the role of </p>
  <p>1.         speculation (can we fill in the gaps). </p>
  <p>2.         conclusions as to what someone was thinking ‘at some time when
    something happened.’</p>
  <p>3.         If evidence is not sufficient– ‘incomplete’ must we acquit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    response, the trial judge repeated the standard form instruction to decide
    the case on the evidence presented and not to speculate, as well as the standard
    form instruction on reasonable doubt.  He then re-charged the jury on the
    essential elements of the offence. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    4(6) of the <i>Canada Evidence Act</i> provides:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The failure of the person charged, or of the wife
    or husband of that person, to testify shall not be made the subject of comment
    by the judge or by counsel for the prosecution.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    prohibition has been part of Canadian law for over a century.  It was first
    introduced in 1906 following the 1893 reforms to the Act which made accused
    persons and their spouses competent witnesses for the defence: <i>An Act
    further to amend the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    Evidence Act, 1893</i>, S.C. 1906, c. 10, s. 1.  The purpose of the prohibition
    was described in <i>R. v. Romano </i>(1915), 24 C.C.C. 30 (Que. K.B.), as
    to prevent prosecuting counsel from supporting a weak case by exploiting
    the fact that the accused or his or her spouse had elected not to exercise
    their newly acquired right to testify.  Had this “safeguard… not been provided,
    prosecuting counsel would incline… to say to juries: “Here is the prisoner
    who knows what he has done or not done: “Why does he not give his testimony?” or
    “Why does his wife not give her testimony?”: <i>Romano</i>, at p. 31.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More
    recently, in <i>R. v. Noble</i>,<span class=reportcite> [1997] 1 S.C.R. 874, </span>Lamer
    C.J., dissenting, but not on this point, stated at para. 36 that s. 4(6)
    was “originally created to ensure that neither the court nor the prosecution
    would draw unfair attention to the silence of the accused.”  Sopinka J.,
    for the majority, at para. 97, suggested that the purpose of s. 4(6) is to
    prevent the trial judge and the prosecution from inviting the jury to place
    the failure of the accused to testify on the evidentiary scales.  Section
    4(6) is thus closely tied to the right of silence protected by s. 7 of the <i>Charter </i>and
    is consistent with the right against self-incrimination under s. 11(c): <i>Noble</i>,
    per Sopinka J.; <i>R. v. Boss</i> (1988), 46 C.C.C. (3d) 523 (Ont. C.A.),
    per Cory J.A.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    has been consistently held that s. 4(6) must be interpreted in light of its
    purpose rather than in <span style='color:black'>a literal or mechanical
    fashion</span>.  Accordingly, the provision will not be violated where the
    trial judge explains to the jury that the accused has a constitutional right
    not to testify and that the burden of proving the case always rests with
    the Crown, provided the instruction is not “<span
class=verdana>presented to the jury in such fashion as to suggest that… silence
    is being used as a cloak for… guilt”:</span> <i>R. v. McConnell</i>, [1968]
    S.C.R. 802, at p. 809.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly,
    a statement that the Crown’s evidence is
    “not denied” or is “uncontradicted”, standing alone, does not amount to comment
    on the accused’s failure to testify.   As explained by Sopinka J. in <i>Noble</i>,
    at para. 97: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[i]n such a circumstance, the judge is not instructing
    the jury to consider the failure of the accused to testify <i>per se</i>,
    but rather is simply instructing the jury to take note of the fact that no
    evidence had been led to contradict a particular point. Rather than inviting
    the jury to place the failure of the accused on the evidentiary scales, the
    judge is instructing the jury that it need not speculate about possible contradictory
    evidence which has not been led in evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus,
    in order to violate s. 4(6), there must be something more than a reference
    to uncontradicted evidence, something which
    “pointedly draws the attention of the jury to the fact that there is evidence
    which the accused could give and which he has failed to give”: <i>R. v. Wright</i>,
    [1945] S.C.R. 319, at p. 324.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    has also been held that “offhand” or
    “ambiguous” remarks about the need for the jury to base its conclusions on
    the evidence or the absence of evidence supporting the position of the defence
    will not violate the section, especially where the trial judge makes it clear
    to the jury that the burden of proof always rests upon the Crown: <i>R. v.
    Potvin</i>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 525.  Such remarks neither constitute an invitation
    to the jury to infer guilt from silence nor cause prejudice to the accused.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown places particular reliance on the decision of this court in <i>Knox</i>,
    which was referred to and relied upon by the trial judge in his ruling.  In <i>Knox</i>,<i> </i>the
    accused was charged with a number of offences arising from a collision with
    an officer in a stolen car.  The issue was identity.  The accused was found
    present in a field close to the scene of the collision.  In the course of
    explaining to the jury that they were not to draw wild inferences about why
    he was conveniently found in this field, Crown counsel stated:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Obviously, Mr. Knox has a constitutional right
    not to testify. He has to prove nothing here. The onus is on the Crown the
    whole time, but having said that, if he chooses not to testify, then the
    Crown’s case stands or falls on its own two feet.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>while the defence doesn’t have to call evidence,
    it’s entitled to.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 style='line-height:
normal;'>Relying on <i>McConnell </i>and <i>Potvin</i>,<i> </i>Laskin J.A. held
    that while the remarks were “close to the line”, and would have been “better
    left unsaid”, they did not go so far as to suggest that the accused was using
    silence as a cloak for his guilt: <i>Knox</i>, at para. 62.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    case is different from <i>Knox</i>. Each case must be decided on the basis
    of its own facts and the impugned remarks must be considered in context and
    in the light of the purposive approach to the interpretation of s. 4(6).
    No trial, as is often said, is perfect, and we must give some latitude for
    the give and take of the adversarial process.  However, Parliament has drawn
    a line that reflects a fundamental value of our criminal justice system. In
    cases where <span
style='color:black'>the cumulative effect of what Crown counsel has said “invited
    the jury to act upon the failure of the accused to give evidence on matters
    that were essential to the theory of the Crown in proof of the guilt of the
    accused”, we find ourselves in a situation </span>where “incidents which,
    considered in isolation, may be excused as regrettable but of no consequence,
    combine to create an overall appearance which is incompatible with our standards
    of fairness”: <i>R. v. Woodcock</i> (1996), 81 B.C.A.C. 27 (C.A.), at paras.
    27-28; <i>R. v. Stewart</i> <span style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none;text-underline:
none'>(1991), 62 C.C.C. (3d) 289</span> (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), at p. 320. The cases demonstrate that there is a limit to what can be
    reconciled with the statutory protection accorded to an accused person who
    chooses to remain silent: see e.g. <i>R. v. Lee</i>, [1970] 3 O.R. 285 (C.A.); <i>R.
    v. Miller</i> (1998), <span class=ssl21><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'>131 C.C.C. (3d) 141 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  </span></span>We must prevent the erosion of the statutory protection
    of s. 4(6) and discourage prosecutors from devising clever or subtle ways
    to focus the jury’s attention on the failure of the accused to testify.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the case at bar, the prosecutor made two references to the fact that the
    Crown’s evidence stood uncontradicted.  He stated that there was “no evidence” of
    an
    “alternative version of what happened” other than the complainant’s.  He
    then said that the only evidence regarding the issue of consent was what
    she had told the jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    comments, standing alone, probably would not have violated s. 4(6) on the
    authorities I have mentioned.  However, Crown counsel was not prepared to
    leave it at that and later in his closing, in reference to the accused’s
    belief in consent, he added:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Now, that may present a problem, because you need
    to figure out what his knowledge was as to whether or not she was consenting. <i>But
    he didn’t testify, so he can’t be asked directly what he thought at the time
    or what he construed or what he knew. </i> [Emphasis added.] </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    words “but he didn’t testify” clearly amount to a comment on the failure
    of the appellant to testify within the letter of s. 4(6).  But do they violate
    the spirit or purpose of s. 4(6)?  In my view, it is clear that they do. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    comment must be read in the context of the submission that there was no “alternate
    version” and that complainant’s evidence was uncontradicted.  It must also
    be read with the submission that as the appellant did not testify, he could
    not be questioned.  Crown counsel was pointing out to the jury not only that
    the accused remained silent and offered no explanation for what occurred
    on the night in question but also that he was not prepared to expose himself
    to cross-examination.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown’s closing in this case cannot be explained away as a passing reference
    to the right of the accused not to testify that did not prejudice the accused.
    Commenting on the accused’s <i>failure to testify</i>, as in this case, is
    quite different from commenting on the accused’s <i>constitutional right
    not to testify,</i> as in <i>Knox.</i> (I add, however, that surely one can
    expect Crown counsel to refrain from comments indentified by this court as “close
    to the line” and “better left unsaid”.)</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the comments in the case at bar cannot be excused as ambiguous or
    off-hand.  Rather, they appear to have been part of a carefully structured
    closing address that <span style='color:black'>pointedly drew the attention
    of the jury to the fact that the accused did not take the stand.  If the
    Crown’s closing address did not do so explicitly, it strongly implied that
    the jury could and should infer that the appellant’s silence and his refusal
    to expose himself to cross-examination were indicia of his guilt. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    us, the Crown argues that the accused’s failure to testify was the “elephant
    in the room”.  It was obvious, the Crown argues, that there were only two
    people who could explain what occurred and the jury was bound to infer guilt
    from the appellant’s silence.  In my view, this argument does not assist
    the Crown.  There is a clear distinction between inferences that the jury
    may draw from the accused’s silence in the absence of a comment and the statutory
    right of the accused not to have the prosecutor or the judge invite the jury
    to place evidentiary weight on his failure to testify through a comment.  As
    Charron J.A. observed in <i>Mille</i><span class=HeadingNumberChar><i><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman";'>r</span></i></span><span
class=HeadingNumberChar><span style='font-family:"Times New Roman";'>, at para.
    14:</span></span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The appellant, in choosing not to testify, can
    expect a jury may draw an adverse inference against him.  However, by reason
    of the express provision under s. 4(6), he is assured that no greater weight
    will be placed upon his failure to testify by reason of a comment by the
    prosecutor or the judge. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the problem caused by the comment on the failure of the accused
    to testify was exacerbated by the Crown’s earlier reference to the “timid
    juror” in relation to an explanation of the concept of reasonable doubt.  This
    court has stated that this sort of language is to be avoided as it may confuse
    jurors regarding the meaning of reasonable doubt: <i>R. v. Karthiresu</i> (2000),
    129 O.A.C. 291.  While reference to the “timid juror” standing alone may
    not be fatal, its use here added to the problem created by the Crown’s references
    to the accused’s failure to testify.  Moreover, the reference to “timid juror” in
    the face of a clear warning from this court in<i> Karthiresu</i>, when read
    with the comment on the appellant’s failure to testify, suggests that Crown
    counsel may well have been flirting with danger and deliberately testing
    the outer limits of what is permissible. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    I note that the questions from the jury indicate that they were troubled
    by what they perceived to be a hole in the evidence.  The Crown’s closing
    indicated that the only hole in the evidence in this case was the accused’s
    failure to testify.  Viewed in this light, the jury’s questions suggest that
    there was a real risk that the appellant was prejudiced by the Crown’s comment
    on his failure to testify.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    am not persuaded that we should refuse to allow the appeal because the appellant’s
    trial counsel insisted that nothing short of a mistrial was capable of curing
    the situation.  Nor would I apply the curative proviso under s. 686(1)(b)(iii)
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  The comments of Crown counsel violated the
    appellant’s statutory right under s. 4(6) of the <i>Canada Evidence Act</i>.  The
    complainant’s evidence was challenged and the Crown’s case was not overwhelming.  The
    jury’s subsequent questions indicate that they may well have been concerned
    about the failure of the accused to testify.  As I find that the Crown’s
    closing amounted to an invitation to the jury to infer guilt from the accused’s
    failure to testify that prejudiced the appellant’s right to a fair trial,
    it is my view that the conviction must be set aside. </p>
