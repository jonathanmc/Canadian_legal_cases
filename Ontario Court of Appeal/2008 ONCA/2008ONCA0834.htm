  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant raises two grounds of appeal against his conviction on one count
    of arson endangering life and one ground of appeal in relation to his conviction
    on one count of causing damage by fire to a dwelling house with intent to
    defraud.</p>
  <p><b>1) <i>R. v. W.(D.)</i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant contends that the trial judge failed to apply the <i>R. v. W.(D.)</i> standard.  While
    the trial judge did not recite the <i>W.(D.)</i> formula, in our view, his
    reasons make it clear that he properly considered the issue of reasonable
    doubt.  In particular, he specifically considered whether the appellant’s
    out-of-court statements gave rise to a reasonable doubt and concluded that
    they did not have that effect.</p>
  <p><b>2) After-the-fact conduct</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    see no error in relation to the trial judge’s use of evidence of phone calls
    before and after the fire and of the meeting the day after the fire.  It
    was open to the trial judge to reject the appellant’s explanation for those
    calls and for that meeting and to treat this evidence as evidence of acts
    in furtherance of a conspiracy to commit arson.</p>
  <p><b>3) Causing damage by fire to a dwelling house with intent to defraud</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the trial judge did not make the findings required to support the
    conviction for what was alleged in Count 5 of the indictment, namely, that
    the appellant had with the intent to defraud Pilot Insurance, caused damage
    by fire to his property.  While there may well have been evidence from which
    the <i>mens rea</i> to commit this offence could have been inferred, there
    is no finding to that effect.  As we read his reasons, the trial judge treated
    this count as one of attempted fraud. The trial judge found that the appellant
    had assisted his brother in advancing the insurance claim on behalf of the
    corporation that owned the property. However, the trial judge did not find
    that the appellant had the intention to defraud when he caused damage to
    his property.  The thrust of the Crown’s case was that the appellant had
    the fire set to rid himself of undesirable tenants and as the trial judge
    observed at one point during the sentencing submissions: “There doesn’t appear
    to be any real fiscal motive here, that’s true.” In our view, in the absence
    of a finding to the effect the appellant had caused the fire with the intent
    to defraud, an essential element of this offence, the conviction cannot stand
    and a new trial must be ordered on that count.</p>
  <h3><u>Sentence appeal</u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge gave full consideration to the fact that the appellant had no
    record and that there was no serious threat of his re-offending.  Given the
    gravity of this offence, in particular, the fact that the offence demonstrated
    a callous disregard for human life, we see no error on his part in rejecting
    a conditional sentence and in finding that in the circumstances of the case,
    the interest of general deterrence justified a custodial sentence.  We do
    not agree that the sentence should be altered because of the fact that the
    conviction for Count 5 cannot stand. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the conviction appeal is allowed in part by setting aside the conviction
    on Count 5 and ordering a new trial on that count.  Leave to appeal sentence
    is granted, but the sentence appeal is dismissed.</p>
