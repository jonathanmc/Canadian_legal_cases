  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      This
    appeal from the order of Allen J. concerns the application of the doctrine
    of <i>res judicata</i> where there has been a change in the law.  In April
    2002, a 5 ½
    month old infant sustained a serious head injury.  The child’s mother originally
    told hospital staff that the child was injured when he fell down a stairway.  Several
    months later, the law firm representing the family put the family’s automobile
    insurer on notice of their intention to commence a legal action for injuries
    sustained by the infant.  The family was now taking the position that the
    child’s injuries were sustained in an automobile accident.  The insurer retained
    three experts to provide opinions about the cause of the injuries.  It is
    the opinion of the experts that the child’s injuries were probably caused
    by a fall down the stairs, and not by a motor vehicle accident. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      Although
    no legal proceeding has been brought, the insurer seeks to preserve the evidence
    of its three experts, given the lengthy time that could elapse before an
    action is brought. In 2005, Echlin J. made an order allowing for the examination
    of the three experts.  In reasons reported at (2006), 80 O.R. (3d) 671, this
    court overturned that decision, holding that rule 36.01 did not confer any
    power on the court to order the preservation of evidence prior to commencement
    of a proceeding.   That rule permits a “party” to conduct an examination
    under oath or affirmation for the purpose of preserving the evidence of a
    potential witness.  This court held that since there was no existing action
    the insurer was not a party within the meaning of the rule.  Writing for
    the court, Borins J.A., at para. 17, suggested that the Civil Rules Committee
    consider an amendment to rule 36.01:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Given the possibility,
    remote though it may be, that no proceeding would be taken by, or on behalf,
    of the injured child until as late as 2021, and considering the dispute about
    the cause of the child's injuries, it made good sense for the respondent
    to retain experts to explore this issue at an early stage when the evidence
    was fresh. Given the ages of two of the experts, it also made sense to seek
    to preserve their evidence through the application of rule 36.01 to counter
    the possibility that they would be unavailable to testify in the future.
    Indeed, had rule 36.01 conferred power to order preservation of evidence
    before the commencement of an action, no fault could have been found with
    the application judge's order other than his failure to order the respondent
    to reimburse the Sivakumar family for all costs and expenses incurred in
    participating in the examination of the respondents' experts. Similar situations
    may occur in the future. For that reason, the Civil Rules Committee may wish
    to consider extending the application of rule 36.01 to situations in which
    no proceeding has been commenced.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    Civil Rules Committee acted on this suggestion and amended rule 36.01 to
    provide for a definition of party to include a party to a pending or intended
    proceeding.  As a result of this amendment, the insurer returned to court
    to again seek an order under rule 36.01.  The respondents do not dispute
    that there is power to make the order sought but they argue that the matter
    is <i>res judicata</i> in light of this court’s earlier decision.  The motions
    judge agreed with that position.  She also held at para. 17 of her reasons
    that the case “presents no special circumstances that call for the matter
    to be re-adjudicated”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      In <i>Minott
      v. O’Shanter Development Co.</i> (1999), 42 O.R. (3d) 321 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), this court considered the application of the doctrine of issue estoppel,
    an aspect of the <i>res judicata</i> doctrine.  Speaking for the court at
    p. 340, Laskin J.A. confirmed that the doctrine is to be applied flexibly
    and that the court retains a discretion not to apply the doctrine where necessary “to
    achieve practical justice without undermining the principles on which issue
    estoppel is founded”.  He noted at the same page that one example of special
    circumstances for not applying the doctrine is where there has been a change
    in the law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      In
    my view, assuming that <i>res judicata</i> applied, the motions judge erred
    in principle in holding that there were no special circumstances.  The change
    in rule 36.01, as a result of this very case, gave rise to special circumstances.  An
    order allowing the insurer to preserve evidence that might otherwise be lost
    would achieve practical justice without undermining the principles on which <i>res
    judicata</i> is founded.  This was only a preliminary step in what may or
    may not turn out to be an action.  The potential plaintiffs have not changed
    their position because of the earlier decision of this court.  This is not
    an attempt to impeach an earlier judicial finding; by reason of the change
    in the law, the original result should not be binding in the new context.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      In
    my view, the motion judge also erred in finding that the respondent would
    be prejudiced by the order.  Any prejudice to the respondents can be dealt
    with by an order requiring the insurer to pay all the costs and expenses
    associated with the examination and by the trial judge’s discretion under
    rule 36.01(2) to decide whether to admit the evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      However,
    in my view, the order for examination should be made only in relation to
    Mr. Nassar and Dr. Knight.  Rule 36.01(3) lists a number of factors that
    the court shall take into account when asked to exercise its discretion to
    make an order for examination of a witness prior to trial.  The list concludes
    with “any other relevant consideration”.  Dr.&nbsp;Hollenberg’s opinion is
    based solely on his review of the child’s medical records.  The motion judge
    noted “any general surgeon or paediatric neurologist could examine the medical
    records if required in the future by the commencement of an action”.  In
    my view, it was open to the motion judge to find that this was a relevant
    consideration and was a basis for the exercise of her discretion against
    making the order for examination.  The same cannot, however, be said about
    Mr. Nassar and Dr. Knight.  They had examined the vehicle that was alleged
    to have been involved in the accident.  It is unlikely that the vehicle would
    still be available for examination if an action is started many years from
    now.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      Accordingly,
    I would allow the appeal, and make an order under rule 36.01 for the examination
    of Mr. Nassar and Dr. Knight.  The appellant is to reimburse the respondents  for
    all costs and expenses on a full indemnity basis incurred in participating
    in the examination of the appellant’s experts.  Consistent with this order,
    I would order that the appellant pay the costs of the Children’s Lawyer fixed
    at $8,500 inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
