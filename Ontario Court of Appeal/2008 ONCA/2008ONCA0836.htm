  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is an appeal from the judgment of Ramsay J. in the Superior Court of Justice
    dated May 23, 2007 finding the appellant liable for fraud and awarding of
    the respondent $216,000 and costs on a substantial indemnity basis fixed
    in the amount of $100,000. The basis of the appellant’s liability was his
    participation in a fraudulent scheme perpetrated by the defendant Cook, who
    by the time of trial was nowhere to be found.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Cook
    induced the respondent to invest US$200,000 in a fraudulent scheme. In order
    to give the scheme an air of legitimacy, Cook claimed to be the agent of
    the appellant who is a well-to-do businessman. Cook represented that the
    appellant was involved in the transaction. Cook instructed the respondent
    to provide the US$200,000 to be invested in the form of a bank draft payable
    to Maguro Investments Inc., a single-purpose company incorporated by the
    appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    single-purpose for which the appellant says he incorporated the company was
    to engage in a “show of money transaction” with one Gibbons. Deluce had known
    Gibbons since 1996 and had participated with him in “show of money transactions” in
    the past. The transaction between the appellant and Gibbons worked as follows.
    Gibbons would pay a fee of $100,000 to the appellant upon the appellant and
    his company proving they had $10 million in the bank and agreeing to keep
    it there for a period of 30 days and passing a board resolution naming Cook
    director of finance of the company. The whereabouts of Gibbons is also unknown.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    September 6, 2000, a representative of the respondent met with the appellant
    and Cook at the appellant’s lawyer’s office. The representative asked Cook: “Is
    this the man that I turn the cheque over to?” Cook answered: “Yes.” The representative
    gave the bank draft to the appellant and asked him to sign a copy of the
    draft as a receipt, which the appellant did. The representative then asked
    the appellant if the trades would
    “start now” and the appellant replied “Yes.” Cook also confirmed that the
    trades would start now. The appellant accepted the bank draft for $200,000,
    kept his fee of $100,000 for the “show of money” transaction, and remitted
    the remaining $100,000 to Gibbons. The board resolution appointing Cook director
    of finance of Maguro was passed the next day, though a draft had been circulated
    earlier. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that there is no evidence that he was aware of or participated
    in Cook’s fraudulent scheme. He pointed out there is no evidence he knew
    anything about what Cook told the respondent. He argued that the respondent
    was not induced to make the investment by anything he said or did, and in
    particular the investment money had already been delivered to him when he
    confirmed that the trades would start now. Moreover, he argued there was
    no basis to infer he had anything in mind other than his own transaction
    with Gibbons. Finally, since the board resolution was passed after the respondent
    delivered the money, there is no basis upon which Cook could be found to
    be his agent, nor is there any basis upon which he could be found to have
    ratified Cooke’s acts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite
    the able argument of the appellant’s counsel, we do not agree. The appellant
    was asked by Gibbons to meet with Cook and the respondent. He realized the
    purpose of the meeting was for the respondent to mitigate its risk with respect
    to the transaction with Cook. Specifically, he admitted that he knew that
    the purpose of the meeting was for the respondent to confirm that $10 million
    was available. He met with the respondent.  In fact, while the appellant
    had committed to hold $10,000,000 on deposit in the bank, Gibbons and Cook
    had no access to it and it could not legitimately provide any comfort to
    their investors. The trial judge observed that a sophisticated and astute
    investor like the appellant would appreciate the only possible value of the “show
    of money” transaction would be to allow someone like Cook to claim falsely
    that he was backed by the money. The trial judge inferred that the appellant
    allowed Cook to use the appellant’s name and that of his company and the
    fact they had $10 million in the bank to support any investments he solicited.
    The trial judge stated “If [the appellant] did not know what Cook was telling
    people, that is because he did not want to know.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    so finding the trial judge made an inference of fact that was logically grounded
    in the evidence. It was open to him to conclude that the appellant was, at
    least, wilfully blind to the fraudulent scheme and to his role in it. We
    see no error in this conclusion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    this conclusion, it is not necessary to consider the appellant’s argument,
    which was raised for the first time in this court, that his liability should
    be limited to disgorging the $100,000 he received from the transaction. Nor
    are we persuaded that leave should be granted to appeal the trial judge’s
    award of costs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal is dismissed. As agreed by counsel, the costs of the appeal are fixed
    in the amount of $10,000 inclusive of disbursements and GST. </p>
