  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant appeals the dismissal of his claim for common law severance damages
    for wrongful dismissal.  The central issue on this appeal is whether the
    trial judge erred in limiting the appellant’s entitlement to the minimum
    required by the <i>Employment Standards Act,</i> S.O. 2000, c. 41 (“<i>ESA</i>”)
    on the basis of the following clause incorporated into the written memorandum,
    signed by the appellant, setting out the terms of his employment:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b><u>Termination of Employment – </u></b>Your
    employment may be terminated for cause at any time in which event you shall
    be entitled to only the amount of your salary and vacation pay earned up
    to the effective date of termination.  Your employment may be terminated
    without cause for any reason <i>upon the provision of reasonable notice equal
    to the requirements of the applicable employment or labour standards legislation.</i>  <i>By
    signing below, you agree that upon the receipt of your entitlements in accordance
    with this legislation, no further amounts will be due and payable to you
    whether under statute or common law. </i>[Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge provided detailed reasons for judgment rejecting the submission
    that this clause was ambiguous and holding that it was supported by consideration
    and enforceable against the appellant.  The appellant raises four grounds
    of appeal.</p>
  <h3><i>1. Is the termination clause ambiguous?</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that this clause is ambiguous because it provides for “reasonable
    notice”.  As s. 5(2) of the <i>ESA</i> provides that an employee is entitled
    to the benefit of any contractual provision for greater benefits than those
    conferred by the Act, the appellant submits that he is entitled to reasonable
    notice according to the common law standard. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    disagree.  In our view the effect of this clause is clear.  The words “reasonable
    notice” cannot be read in isolation.  They must be read in the context of
    the clause as a whole.  When read in their proper context, the words “reasonable
    notice” cannot be taken to import the general common law standard.  Rather,
    the clause clearly provides that the reasonable notice period to which the
    employee is entitled is “equal to the requirements of the applicable employment
    or labour standards legislation.”  To resolve any possible doubt, the concluding
    words of the clause exclude any further amounts “whether under statute or
    common law.” </p>
  <p><b><i>2. Is the termination provision void at law?</i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the termination provision is void because it excludes
    entitlement to claims that could arise under other statutes, for example,
    the <i>Human Rights Code</i>.  In support of this argument, the appellant
    relies on <i>Machtinger v. HOJ Industries Ltd.,</i> [1992] 1 S.C.R. 986.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Machtinger</i> is
    distinguishable.  It considered an employment contract which failed to meet
    the minimum notice requirements of the <i>ESA</i>.  The rationale behind <i>Machtinger</i> is
    that an employer who drafts a clause that attempts to avoid the minimum statutory
    notice requirements cannot rely on such a clause to show that the intent
    of the parties was to provide the minimum statutory notice.  The provision
    at issue here meets that statutory standard.  The <i>ESA</i> is the only
    statute applicable in this case.  Whether the provision would be effective
    to bar other statutory claims simply does not arise.  In our view, the possibility
    that a court might not enforce the provision in the face of some other statute
    has no bearing on its enforceability in relation to the minimum notice period.</p>
  <p><b><i>3. Is the termination provision supported by consideration?</i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was first employed by the respondent in July 1995.  The termination
    provision was first introduced into the appellant's employment contract in
    December 2000 under a company-wide policy that all employees at his level
    should be subject to such a provision.  In April 2001 the appellant was given
    a significant promotion: he became the “Managing Director for the Canada
    Region”.  The appellant signed a written memorandum indicating his agreement
    to the terms for this position.  That memorandum included details of the
    compensation he would receive and also included the impugned termination
    provision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the termination provision is unsupported by consideration.  He
    argues that as he had assumed the position of managing director some two
    and a half weeks before he signed the memorandum, the termination provision
    was unilaterally imposed by the respondent after the fact. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge rejected this submission and we see no error in that regard.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the trial judge held that when the termination provision was first included
    as a term of the appellant’s employment contract in December 2000, effective
    January 2001, it was supported by consideration.  At that time significant
    changes were made to the appellant’s remuneration package including some
    improvements.  We agree with the trial judge that these changes provided
    consideration to support the termination provision.  If the termination provision
    was enforceable as of January 2001, it clearly remained enforceable under
    the April 2001 agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    and in any event, we agree with the trial judge’s conclusion that the termination
    provision in the April 2001 agreement was supported by consideration given
    at the time the appellant was promoted.  There is no doubt that the enhanced
    position and remuneration attached to the position of Managing Director was
    capable of providing any consideration that might be necessary to support
    the enforceability of the termination clause.  The fact that the memorandum
    of agreement containing this provision was not signed until some time after
    the appellant was awarded the position did not render the termination clause
    unenforceable.  The trial judge found as a fact that when the appellant agreed
    to assume his new position in April 2001, he was aware of the company-wide
    policy that required this termination provision.  We see no basis to interfere
    with this factual finding.  The appellant was a senior management employee
    (the company’s most senior in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    ) who had been involved in terminations and his own agreement already contained
    a termination clause in precisely the same terms.  Simply put, when the appellant
    agreed to accept promotion to the position of managing director with all
    the benefits that position entailed, on the findings of the trial judge which
    were supported by the evidence, he knew that the termination clause was a
    necessary part of his employment package.  The situation is distinguishable
    from cases such as <i>Francis v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce</i> (1994),
    21 O.R. (3d) 75 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) and <i>Braiden v. La-Z-Boy Canada Ltd. </i>(2008), 294 D.L.R. (4th) 172
    (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) where termination clauses were unilaterally inserted by the employer with
    no countervailing benefit being extended to the employee.</p>
  <p><b><i>4. Is the respondent disentitled to rely on the termination clause
        because of repudiation or failure to pay the minimum ESA requirements?</i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the respondent repudiated its agreement by failing
    to give the time prescribed by a company policy to consider its initial severance
    offer which included benefits in excess of the minimum <i>ESA</i> requirements.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is clear on the record that the appellant immediately rejected the respondent’s
    offer.  He did not ask for more time to consider it.  In the face of his
    immediate rejection we fail to see how the minimum time period in the company’s
    policy can have any bearing on this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant further submits that the respondent failed to pay him all the amounts
    required under the <i>ESA</i> and, having failed to meet that minimum standard,
    it cannot rely on the termination clause.  In this regard, the appellant
    asserts a claim for a car allowance and for an “EBITDA bonus”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    reject this submission on the ground that these claims were not pleaded,
    no evidence was led at trial to make the case that the appellant was entitled
    to these amounts, and the ground was not raised in the Notice of Appeal.  Moreover,
    we note that a claim for the EBITDA bonus was raised in argument before the
    trial judge as to the appropriate common law damages.  In his consideration
    of common law damages, the trial judge found that the appellant did not qualify
    for the amount claimed under the terms of the EBITDA program.  We see no
    reason to interfere with that finding.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    even if the appellant were entitled to something for the car allowance and
    the EBITDA bonus, this would not amount to a repudiation requiring the respondent
    to pay full common law damages for wrongful dismissal.  The appellant’s only
    remedy would be judgment for any amount he was owed.</p>
  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the appeal is dismissed.  We were alerted by counsel that offers to settle
    could have a bearing on costs.  Unless we receive written submissions within
    10 days from the release of these reasons indicating that we should make
    some other award in view of an offer to settle, the respondent is awarded
    costs fixed at $30,000 inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>
