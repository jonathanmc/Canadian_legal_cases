  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    appellant was convicted by a jury of second degree murder. He was sentenced
    to life imprisonment without eligibility for parole for 20 years. He appeals
    the conviction and from the period of parole ineligibility.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;
'><b>OVERVIEW </b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      On
    December 10, 2001, shortly before 10:42 pm, David Bryan was murdered a short
    distance from the front door of the apartment building where he lived with
    his girlfriend and her two children, in the Scarborough area of Toronto.
    The deceased died from two bullet wounds: one struck him in the right lower
    abdomen causing massive bleeding; the other penetrated the top of the victim’s
    skull, travelled through the brain, and exited out of the left side of his
    mouth. The bullets were discharged from a 9 mm handgun.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      Three
    men were in a position to testify as to the shooting of the deceased. One
    was Harold Usher who was called by the Crown. A second, Dwane Campbell, although
    available to both parties, was not called by either the Crown or the defence.
    The third was the appellant who elected not to testify or to call any other
    witnesses.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      It
    was the defence position that the main Crown witness, Harold Usher, was the
    shooter. Trial counsel (neither Mr. Lockyer nor Mr. Snell) advanced the theory
    that Usher had both strong motive and opportunity to kill the deceased: the
    appellant had neither. Concomitantly, it was the defence position that the
    appellant was not present at the time or location where the shooting occurred.
    In his closing address to the jury, counsel  succinctly put the defence position
    this way:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The theory of
    the defence, our position firmly and straightly put, is that
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Roland Lane was not present when David Bryan was killed.  He had nothing
    to do with it.  He has no knowledge, nothing to do with the death of David
    Bryan. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      Further,
    in his jury address, counsel made his position clear that the person seen
    by two witnesses urinating against the wall of the apartment building just
    prior to the shooting was not the appellant; nor was it the appellant who
    took a cab from a near-by gas station after being dropped off  by Harold
    Usher shortly after the killing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      In
    support of its theory that the police charged the wrong man, the defence
    challenged the competency of the investigation and the integrity of the detective
    in charge.  Defence counsel asserted that once Harold Usher provided a videotape
    statement alleging the appellant was the shooter, Detective Giroux was “close
    minded” to the possibility that Usher was the killer. The attack on the sufficiency
    of the investigation and the competency and integrity of the lead detective
    was a major feature of this case. Defence counsel pulled no punches. This
    is what he told the jury in his closing:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>This case, in
    many ways, is a testament to what police officers can do when they close
    their minds to the evidence and abdicate their duties to us.  The penitentiaries
    of this country are littered with innocent people who are in jail solely
    because of shoddy or corrupt police investigations.  We do not need another
    one.  That Mr. Bryan’s family were denied an honest and competent investigation
    into his death, and that the person who, in my submission, most likely killed
    him was given utter immunity, is not only a horrible tragedy, it is a miscarriage
    of justice that should send a chill through your hearts.  We have all heard
    the stubborn intransigence of Detective Giroux.  His refusal to investigate
    and charge Harold Usher should sicken us all.  And I’m suggesting to you
    that his refusal to even consider Harold Usher, to even consider revoking
    the immunity deal that Harold Usher has, should pale, should just send quivers
    through your spine.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>   Harold
    Usher was the central witness for the Crown. He provided the only direct
    evidence of the appellant’s guilt. The success of the Crown’s case turned
    on the jury accepting the truthfulness of Usher’s evidence. The evidence
    of Harold Usher had many frailties and posed significant dangers for the
    jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>   Usher
    was a disreputable witness with a significant criminal record.  He owed the
    deceased money from a drug debt. He acknowledged the deceased was angry with
    him and threatened to kill him on the night of the murder. He further admitted
    possession of a gun, albeit not a 9 mm handgun, three days prior to the murder.
    Moreover, following the shooting of the deceased, Usher left for
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Montreal before turning himself in to the police seven days later.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>   In
    these circumstances, the task for the Crown was to support and confirm by
    independent evidence Usher’s version of events in order to restore faith
    in an otherwise untrustworthy witness.</p>

    testified that he, Dwane Campbell and the appellant planned to rob a jeweller
    who, they believed, carried large amounts of money and jewellery nightly
    from his business in downtown
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto to his home in
    <st1:place

    <st1:City w:st="on">

    <st1:place

    Newmarket. In preparation, Usher, Campbell and the appellant had kept the
    jeweller under surveillance, following him from his business to his home
    on two prior occasions; December 4, 2001 and December 7, 2001. On December
    10, the day of the murder, the three men intended to follow the jeweller
    home and, when he arrived, carry out the robbery. According to Usher, his
    role was to drive his girlfriend’s Aztec motor vehicle: Campbell and the
    appellant were to carry out the robbery.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Shortly
    after 8:30 pm, Usher, Campbell and the appellant began following the jeweller
    from downtown

    Toronto, believing he was going directly home to
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    meeting for that evening. Instead of taking his usual route home, he deviated
    from his normal course and travelled in a direction not anticipated by his
    would be assailants. Usher, Campbell and the appellant decided to proceed
    directly to the jeweller’s home, await his arrival, then rob him.</p>

    testified he knew the deceased for approximately six to seven years and thought
    of him as a friend. The deceased was also Usher’s drug supplier from whom
    he purchased weekly supplies of marijuana. The deceased’s girlfriend testified
    the deceased was short of money and distressed by the fact a number of individuals,
    including Usher, owed him money. Usher owed
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    first met the appellant on December 4, 2001, six days prior to the murder.
    He was introduced to the appellant by his friend, Dwane Campbell. The sole
    connection between the appellant and Usher was in respect of the robbery
    of the jeweller. Usher testified the appellant was a friend and associate

    leaving Newmarket, instead of returning to the Moss Park area of Toronto,
    as originally planned, Usher decided to go directly to the deceased’s residence
    in Scarborough and repay the $90 drug debt. This decision, according to Usher,
    was prompted by a series of cell phone calls he received while in

    deal with him.”  Usher’s response was that the deceased was his friend and

    testified he arrived at the deceased’s apartment building and pulled up behind
    a white car.  Prior to the deceased coming out of the building,  the appellant
    got out of the  front passenger side of the vehicle, leaving the door open,
    and went to the wall of the apartment building to urinate.  When the deceased
    came out of the apartment building a minute or so later, he approached Usher
    on the driver side at which time Usher handed the deceased $90 to pay the
    drug debt. As noted, the appellant was out of the vehicle when this transfer

    Campbell rolled down the back window and had words with the deceased.  Usher
    got out of the car in an effort to separate the men and put his left arm

    thereafter, the deceased assumed what Usher described as a linebacker position,
    and using Usher as his shield, moved towards the apartment building.  Usher
    states he saw an object near his left rib and heard a pop. He turned and
    ran back to his vehicle.  He heard two more pops.  As he put the vehicle
    into reverse, the appellant jumped back into the front seat, adjusted something
    in his waistband and said “don’t worry… that nigger is dead.”</p>

    Feltis’s opinion was that the shot to the deceased’s abdomen preceded the

    was the gunshot wound to the abdomen came first, buckling the deceased into
    a forward position thereby exposing the top of the head to the shooter.</p>

    a result, cell phone records of the appellant, the deceased and Usher played
    a prominent role in the Crown’s case. Their significance, if accepted, provided
    circumstantial evidence supporting Usher’s testimony that the appellant was
    present with Usher in Newmarket less than an hour before the killing, and
    present with Usher when Usher drove to the deceased’s residence. If accepted,
    the records also tended to confirm Usher’s version of events involving the
    appellant’s presence with Usher in the planning of the robbery on days immediately
    before the killing.  Also, of particular importance were cell phone calls
    made by Usher to the deceased, and the location from which those calls were

    Even so, the defence contended, the police refused to consider Usher as an
    alternate suspect and refused to resile from the agreement. Counsel in his
    cross-examination of Usher, as well as his cross-examination of the Telus

    to rule “that approach has raised an issue concerning the integrity, or,

    suspect was inextricably linked to the quality of the police investigation.  It
    is submitted that because the appellant attacked Usher’s credibility by alleging
    that he was the murderer, this ought not to be seen as maintaining an attack
    on the integrity of the investigation causing the consequences that skewed
    the fairness of the trial.  Those consequences, in the appellant’s submission,
    permitted a seasoned police officer to itemize before the jury, pieces of
    investigative evidence he believed bolstered Usher’s credibility.  The prejudicial

    characterized certain submissions made to the trial judge by trial counsel
    in the absence of the jury as “incautious” or “bluster”.  It is submitted
    that in the presence of the jury, trial counsel did not complain about the

    is with increasing frequency that this court is called upon to deal with
    issues arising from defence allegations at trial of inadequate police investigations.  The
    two leading cases, in this area, are the court’s decisions in <i>R. v. Dhillon </i>(2002),
    166 C.C.C. (3d) 262 and <i>R. v. Mallory </i>(2007), 217 C.C.C. (3d) 266.  These
    cases illustrate the brier patch of problems both counsel and trial judges
    can encounter when this issue arises.  These cases also provide a roadmap
    of how to deal with some of the difficulties that may arise.<i> </i> </p>

line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    a starting point, it is important to reinforce the wisdom of the statement
    found at paragraph 87 of <i>Mallory</i> that the decision by an accused to
    attack the integrity of an investigation, while permitted, is a risky strategy.  It
    is risky because when the defence seeks to cast doubt on the adequacy of
    the investigation, fairness permits the Crown to lead evidence about the
    adequacy and integrity of the police investigation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    case did not feature many of the dangers evident in both <i>Dhillon</i> and <i>Mallor</i>y.  In <i>Dhillon</i>,
    an array of highly prejudicial, bad character evidence was led by the Crown.  It
    was done in hearsay form, linking the accused and his family to drug smuggling
    and terrorism. Similarly, in <i>Mallory</i> investigative hearsay evidence
    was permitted associating Mallory and Stewart with two other individuals,
    Sauve and Trudel, alleged to be responsible for other killings. In the circumstances
    of those cases, it is difficult to overstate the prejudicial effect. In the
    present case, the trial judge specifically precluded the Crown from calling
    evidence of the appellant’s bad character, as part of the investigative hearsay
    Detective Giroux was to give when he took the stand.  Accordingly, there
    was neither the type of taint or prejudice to this appellant found in cases
    such as <i>Dhillon</i> and <i>Mallory</i>.  </p>

line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Further,
    it is important to observe how little of Detective Giroux’s evidence amounted
    to impermissible hearsay.  Virtually all of the items of investigation referred
    to by the detective were proven by the Crown when it called evidence with
    respect to the matters referred to.  </p>

    do not agree with the appellant’s counsel that the question of Usher’s immunity
    deal was so linked to the inadequacy of the investigation that they should
    be seen as one and the same.  The trial judge clearly permitted defence counsel
    to challenge the arrangement between the police and Usher to establish Usher’s
    testimony was motivated by his desire to avoid prosecution for his own crime.  However,
    trial counsel for the appellant, from start to finish, sought to go further.  The
    record discloses an unswerving determination to attack the manner in which
    the investigation was handled.  Along with challenging the truthfulness of
    Usher, trial counsel’s attack on the investigation formed a central pillar
    of the defence.  </p>

    these circumstances, the trial judge’s decision to permit the Crown to lead
    items of investigative narrative was fair and even handed.  The trial judge
    was familiar with the principles outlined in <i>Dhillon</i>, closely monitored
    the admissibility of the evidence throughout the trial, and clearly understood
    the law.  </p>

    strategy with which counsel approaches a case is at the heart of advocacy.
    Counsel’s strategy and tactics, within an orbit permitted by law, are entitled
    to deference.  However, strategies and tactics have consequences.  When counsel
    advises a trial judge, as trial counsel did in this case, that he wished
    to challenge the sufficiency of the investigation, the trial judge is entitled
    to accept that to be the position of the defence. This is not a case like <i>Mallory</i> where
    the Crown acted precipitously, forcing the defence’s hand.</p>

    do not accept appeal counsel’s assertions that the submissions of defence
    counsel at trial amounted to “bluster” or “incautious” statements. Nor do
    I accept the submission that the trial judge’s ruling was premature. The
    tenor of the defence, which included a challenge to the integrity of cell
    phone records, and sloppiness in failing to interview a witness, made clear
    that counsel was intent on pursuing his attack on the investigation. This
    occurred prior to the trial judge’s ruling.</p>

    the integrity of the investigation was the strategy counsel sought to employ
    in presenting the defence; he did just that.  The consequence in this case
    was the trial judge’s decision to permit Detective Giroux to tell the jury
    of the information he had from various witnesses that tended to confirm Mr.
    Usher’s version of events prior to his issuing a warrant for the appellant’s
    arrest.  It was for the jury to determine whether the detective acted precipitously

    the prejudicial effect of Detective Giroux’s narrative outweigh the probative
    value? As indicated, the jury did not hear bad character evidence related
    to the appellant. Nor was there a significant amount of hearsay that had
    not already been proved through properly admissible evidence from other witnesses.
    The quality of the investigation was challenged and the response was fair

    point of appeal, led through the testimony of Detective Giroux, was negotiated
    and agreed to by both counsel and the trial judge.  It is important to note
    the agreement was formed in the context of a specific aspect of the defence
    attack on the integrity of the investigation; the allegation that Giroux
    refused to consider Usher as a suspect following
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    a tactical perspective, the defence, without calling
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Campbell, wished to accomplish two things.  The first was to lead evidence
    through Giroux that
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Campbell, if called as a witness, might give evidence inconsistent with the
    theory of the Crown that the appellant was the shooter.  Second, defence
    counsel wanted to argue before the jury that an adverse inference be drawn

    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    Campbell's prior statements implicating the appellant to be placed before

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Campbell was an unreliable witness because he gave three materially inconsistent

line-height:normal'>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is convenient to group the evidence of Detective Giroux on this aspect of
    the appeal into three categories. The first was permitting the defence to
    elicit from the detective that
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place

    Campbell was available to testify, and if called, may give evidence inconsistent

line-height:normal'>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second category consists of Giroux’s evidence that
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Campbell made prior inconsistent statements and had a criminal record.  Ordinarily,
    evidence of this kind led by the Crown, where
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Campbell is not called as a witness, is inadmissible.  However, given the
    attack on the investigation, this evidence was relevant to rebut the attack

line-height:normal'>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    third category of Giroux’s evidence relates to his opinion that
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Campbell was unreliable and therefore, the reason the Crown was not calling
    him as a witness.  This became the Crown's evidentiary platform to provide

      a witness. Similarly, in <i>R. v. Smith</i> (1997), 120 C.C.C. (3d) 500,
      this Court held it was inappropriate for defence counsel to justify not

    what impact does this have on the jury proper. Now, the Crown, in his submissions,

    the appellant at that time, Locke&nbsp;J. observed the appellant was a danger
    to society and his chances for rehabilitation were slim. Those comments were
    prophetic.</p>

    May 1999, the appellant was released from the penitentiary on mandatory supervision.  In
    May 2000, he was arrested for a breach of the terms of his parole.  In December
    2000, the parole board reviewed his detention and declined to release him
    until the warrant expired in September 2001. The parole board was satisfied
    the appellant would likely commit an offence causing bodily harm to another
    person.  He was released from the penitentiary approximately three months
    before killing Mr. Bryan.  </p>

    addition to the aggravated assault offence, the appellant had been previously

    killing of David Bryan was a cold-blooded execution.  I agree with the trial
    judge that the appellant is a dangerous man and an individual with a high
    risk of committing future acts of violence.  The trial judge committed no
    error in fixing a period of 20 years eligibility for parole.  </p>
