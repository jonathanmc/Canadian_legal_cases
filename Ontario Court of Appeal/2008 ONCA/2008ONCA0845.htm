    complainant, D.D., and the appellant had been common law partners for seven
    years when, in 1995, L.R. moved in with them.  Two years later, D.D. gave
    birth to the couple’s son, T.  D.D. suffered from rheumatoid arthritis which
    worsened after she gave birth.  Eventually, she was unable to care for T.
    and L.R. took over the majority of the childcare responsibilities.  The appellant
    and L.R. began a romantic relationship.  All three adults and T. lived together
    until December of 2001.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>D.D.
    testified that she and the appellant had an argument in December 2001.  She
    said that the appellant pushed her from behind, slamming her body into the
    counter, knocking her head against a cabinet and shaking her.  She tried
    to fend him off and hit him with a glass mug that was in her hand because
    she was washing dishes at the time of the assault.</p>

    December 29, 2001, D.D. left the home with T. and went to a crisis centre.  The
    following day the appellant called the police complaining that D.D. had left
    with their son and that she had assaulted him with a mug.  He declined to
    make a sworn statement in respect of the alleged assault and did not pursue
    the matter further.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    January 3, 2002, the complainant gave a sworn statement to the police about
    the December 2001 assault and other allegations.  Charges were then laid
    against the appellant.  The day after that, the appellant married L.R.</p>

    returned to live with the appellant.  Although there was a condition that
    the appellant have no contact with the complainant, the complainant phoned
    the home regularly to speak to her son.  She testified that the appellant
    would listen in on the calls.  On the advice of his lawyers, the appellant
    bought T. a cell phone so that he (the appellant) could avoid phone calls
    from the complainant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant testified that over time, the appellant convinced her to sign
    an affidavit recanting her allegations.  She testified that he told her he
    would leave L.R. and that they could get back together but, if she did not
    recant, he and L.R. would make it difficult for her to see her son.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    March 2002, D.D. recanted her allegations that the appellant assaulted her.  She

    the preliminary hearing neared, D.D. moved away.  She testified that the
    distance made her less vulnerable to the appellant’s manipulation.  She went
    to the police and give another sworn statement in which she stated that the
    recantation was a result of the appellant’s having asked her to swear a false
    affidavit and in which she re-affirmed her initial allegations.  The appellant
    was then charged with the additional offences of obstructing justice, extortion
    and breaches of his undertaking.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, the investigating officer Sgt. Vandermeer was asked questions about
    whether the complainant had been charged as a result of her having sworn
    an affidavit recanting the initial allegations.  As Sgt. Vandermeer’s testimony
    is a crucial aspect of this appeal, the relevant parts of his examination-in-chief
    and cross-examination are set out now.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the course of his examination-in-chief, the Crown asked the following questions
    and Sgt. Vandermeer gave the following answers:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q: Did you ever charge D.D. with, ah, any criminal
    offence coming out of this affidavit?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A: I did not.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q: And why was that?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A: When I read the affidavit, I was – my, my thoughts
    on the subject were that she had been influenced in some way into signing
    that affidavit.  I didn’t know how, but I was of that opinion.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q: And, ah, if I could just have a moment, um,
    all right, ah, could you tell us, officer, why you formed that opinion?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A: The affidavit, without going into the details,
    the, ah, actual criminal charges that Mr. Matton was facing, they’re, ah,
    on what’s known as a, ah, Criminal Information.  It’s, ah, very technical
    words.  Ah, it’s a, it’s, it’s a complicated legal document where each charge
    is, ah, stated on that, ah, court document, and it carries, ah – it’s very
    complex, complex document, with many legal words that are sometimes difficult
    to understand.  The basis – the affidavit, in the order and wording that
    was used on it, I was of the opinion that the affidavit had been based on
    the actual Criminal Information charging Mr. Matton with those criminal offences.  And
    I had never given D.D. a, ah, copy of that Information.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    cross-examination, defence counsel asked Sgt. Vandermeer several questions
    with respect to his failure to videotape the statement taken from D.D. after
    she presented him with the affidavit in which she recanted.  In the course
    of those questions, the following exchange occurred:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q: She offered you more detail about her recantation
    than was in the affidavit.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A: Um, the statement that she gave, and this was
    another one of my concerns, um, when I believed that she had been somehow
    influenced into signing that affidavit, the statement that she gave me, the
    written statement, was not consistent with what was in the affidavit.  And
    if she had prepared the affidavit, my view was that her written statement
    would have been consistent, and they weren’t the same.  They were, there
    were differences.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q: Okay, and what were those differences?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A: Well, in her affidavit, she basically stated
    that these offences did not occur.  In her statement, she, that she gave
    me, the offences and the events had still occurred, but she generally took
    credit, basically blamed herself for these events occurring, and the two
    didn’t match; and that caused me concern, that if she, my view was if she
    had prepared the affidavit, her statement following, it should’ve been the
    same and have the same content as the, ah, as the ah, affidavit.  She didn’t
    appear to be that familiar with the contents of the affidavit.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q: And so because there were so many differences
    between the affidavit and the statement she gave you, why wouldn’t you get
    a sworn videotaped statement from her?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A: Well, I, I considered, ah, I can only say what
    I considered at the time.  I, I had a sworn affidavit, and it was sworn,
    and that’s why I did not do a, ah, sworn video statement.  I had sworn testimony.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Shortly thereafter, the
    exchange continued:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q: Okay.  Now you told my friend that, um, one
    of the reasons why you thought she may have been influenced into, um, swearing
    that affidavit was because of the language.  The language seemed to come
    from the Information.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A: Yes, ah, yes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q: Okay, and it concerned you …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A: Yes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q: …that Ms. D. could’ve come up with this language.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A: Yes, actually, I had three concerns.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>MS. BUDGELL: Okay.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A: Um, the first was the, ah, affidavit appeared
    to be very similar in the order of the charges and in the actual technical
    legal wording that was used on the Criminal Information charging Mr. Matton.  The
    second, ah, concern that I had, making me believe she had been somehow influenced
    into signing this was that, ah, her written statement that she gave me was
    not consistent with the affidavit.  If she had made that affidavit, they
    should’ve been similar, and they weren’t.  And the third problem that I had,
    that I found striking was, um, no offence to D.D., but I don’t believe she
    has the educational background to prepare a document like that.  That’s,
    that was what I was thinking.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q: But presumably anybody who had a copy of the
    Information, being the charging document with the list of charges, could’ve
    simply copied them…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A: Yes.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><u><span lang=EN-US>The Grounds of Appeal</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant raises five grounds of appeal.  The first four relate to the charge
    to the jury.  The appellant submits that the trial judge erred in the charge
    by failing to:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal;'>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>provide
    a limiting charge with respect to “opinion evidence” adduced from the investigating
    officer;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal;'>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>instruct
    the jury not to infer guilt from the appellant’s failure to provide a formal
    police statement;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal;'>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>instruct
    on the mental element of the offence of attempting to obstruct justice; and</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal;'>(4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>charge on
    the defence of lawful excuse with respect to the failure to comply charge,
    and in so doing, failed to properly put the theory of the defence to the
    jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>The appellant also submits
    that the verdict on the attempt to obstruct justice charge is unreasonable
    and inconsistent with the not guilty verdict on the extortion count.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the outset of the oral hearing of the appeal, the appellant abandoned the
    second ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown was called on to respond only to the first ground.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE INVESTIGATING OFFICER’S
    “OPINION” EVIDENCE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that Sgt. Vandermeer’s evidence as to why he did not charge
    D.D. for having given him a false affidavit<span style='font-size:14.0pt'> </span>was
    not relevant to any issue at trial.  Consequently, the appellant submits,
    Sgt. Vandermeer’s opinion on that matter served no purpose other than to
    bolster D.D.’s credibility and, therefore, offended the rule against oath-helping<span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    disagree.  The impugned part of Sgt. Vandermeer’s evidence was not adduced
    solely to bolster D.D.’s credibility.  A defence theme in this case was that
    in domestic matters, police policy resulted in different treatment for men
    than for women.  Thus, the Crown’s very limited questioning on this matter
    was directed<span
style='font-size:14.0pt'> </span>at determining why Sgt. Vandermeer had not charged
    the complainant after receiving her recantation.  Sgt. Vandermeer’s evidence
    related to the chronology of events and was limited to the actions he took
    and the reasons for his actions.  In this regard, it is telling that defence
    counsel did not object to the Crown’s examination of Sgt. Vandermeer on this
    point.  Instead, she chose to pursue it in detailed cross-examination.  Further,
    defence counsel did not object to the charge in this regard nor did she seek
    a limiting instruction on it<span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    as Sgt. Vandermeer never gave an opinion about the complainant’s honesty
    or veracity, his evidence did not contravene the rule against oath-helping.  The
    explanation that he offered for not charging D.D. after receiving her recantation
    was based on his investigative process and not which of her versions of events
    he believed.  Rather, as he explained, it was the nature of the language
    in the affidavit – which he described as technical and complex - that caused
    him to think that the complainant had been influenced to sign it.  The references
    to what Sgt. Vandermeer believed related only to his observations about the
    nature of the affidavit and not about the complainant or any aspect of her
    testimony.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>DISPOSITION </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the appeal is dismissed<span style='font-size:14.0pt'>.  </span></p>
