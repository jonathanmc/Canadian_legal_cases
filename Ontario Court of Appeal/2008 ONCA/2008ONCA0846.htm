  <h2>I.          OVERVIEW</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellants, AmeriCredit Corp. &amp; AmeriCredit
    Financial Services of Canada Ltd. (“AmeriCredit”), hired the respondent,
    Douglas McNevan, in June 2001.  Thirteen
    months later, AmeriCredit fired him without cause.  McNevan rejected AmeriCredit’s offer of three
    months’ pay in lieu of notice and brought an action seeking damages for failure
    to provide him with reasonable notice. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After a five-day trial, MacDougall J. granted
    judgment in favour of McNevan, as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(1)       damages of 12 months’ pay in lieu of
    notice, totalling $63,296.13;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(2)       damages of $2,651.64 for reimbursement of
    mitigation expenses; and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>$12,984.26 for losses arising from the Employee Share
    Purchase Plan.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>AmeriCredit appeals the trial judge’s judgment
    on a number of grounds.  The principal
    ground concerns the trial judge’s decision to grant a <i>Wallace </i>extension based on bad faith and unfair dealing in the
    manner of dismissal, which doubled the notice period from six to twelve
    months.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In my view, the trial judge erred, in, among
    other things, awarding a <i>Wallace</i> extension.  The record does not support an increase of
    the base notice period by reason of bad faith in the manner of dismissal. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly, for the reasons that follow, I would
    allow the appeal in part.</p>
  <h2>II.        THE FACTS</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>AmeriCredit is an independent auto finance
    company with a head office in the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>
    .  It operates in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    through various call
    centres.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On June 4, 2001, McNevan, who wanted to relocate
    to
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Peterborough, was hired to work in AmeriCredit’s
    new
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Peterborough
    call centre as Assistant Vice-President, Collections.  His starting salary was $60,000, plus
    benefits, and he was eligible for a bonus.  Shortly after he was hired, the company increased his salary to $62,500
    as a result of a “market adjustment” by the company. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The evidence demonstrated that McNevan was a
    dedicated and hard-working employee.  He brought
    considerable experience in the automobile collection business to his position, particularly
    during the start-up phase of the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Peterborough
    call centre, and he was well-liked by his colleagues.  In his capacity as Assistant Vice-President,
    McNevan was assigned to three departments that collected delinquent loans and was
    responsible for approximately 45 to 60 people.  By all accounts, he successfully responded to the task of addressing these
    difficult accounts.  McNevan’s hard-work
    and ability to develop teamwork meant that his departments frequently met their
    targets.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However, AmeriCredit’s senior management had concerns
    about McNevan’s management ability.  During
    the month of June 2002, shortly before McNevan’s first scheduled performance
    review, the Vice-President and the Senior Vice-President of the company had
    discussions about McNevan’s performance and whether he was capable of
    fulfilling the position of Assistant Vice-President.  They discussed their concerns about McNevan’s
    leadership style, the manner in which he ran departmental meetings, and issues
    regarding his time management skills.  At
    that point, they decided to terminate McNevan’s employment on the basis that he
    had not demonstrated the skill-set required of an Assistant Vice-President.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The corporate perspective was that those in
    leadership positions either have management skills or they do not and so it was
    the company’s policy to terminate unsatisfactory management relationships.  Consequently, McNevan was not provided with
    feedback about the concerns with his management skills nor was there any
    progressive discipline.  He was simply
    fired.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On July 4, 2002, the date of McNevan’s first annual
    performance review, the Vice-President of the company told McNevan that he was
    fired, effective immediately.  He was
    given a letter offering three months’ salary.  The letter contained a paragraph stating:  “We would ask that you indicate acceptance of
    this offer by signing and returning one copy of this letter and the enclosed
    Release to me.  You are encouraged to
    obtain independent legal advice prior to signing these documents.”  The letter went on to thank McNevan for his
    contributions to the company and to wish him success in his future endeavours.          </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Losing his job was very upsetting for McNevan. He
    asked for reasons but received only a general response.  He requested a meeting with senior management
    to try to work something out that would involve keeping his job.  However, the meeting never took place. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The sudden termination caused McNevan to feel
    overwhelmed, dejected and depressed.  He
    visited his family doctor for feelings of depression and sleeplessness.  The doctor prescribed medication to help him
    sleep.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>His distress increased during the months that
    followed his dismissal as he dealt with the company over matters pertaining to
    the termination of his employment, such as his statutory benefits and the
    return of the personal property he had left in his office. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In September or October 2002, McNevan regained sufficient
    strength to begin tying up loose ends with AmeriCredit and to begin seeking new
    employment.  He tried to obtain
    information from the company’s human resources department about his
    entitlements and about the return of his property.  He participated in courses on r<span
style='"Times New Roman"'>é</span>sum<span
style='"Times New Roman"'>é</span> writing, attended
    seminars and presentations on job search strategies and started to make
    contacts within the automotive industry.  In July 2003, he secured a six-month contract
    with the city of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Peterborough.</p>
  <h2>III.       THE TRIAL DECISION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Against this factual background, the trial judge
    considered the appropriate length of the notice period.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
page-break-after:avoid;'><b>(1)       “Extended <i>Bardal</i> factors”</b></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge considered the factors outlined
    in <i>Bardal v. Globe &amp; Mail Ltd.</i> (1960), 24 D.L.R. (2d) 140 (Ont. H.C.), as relevant in determining the
    reasonable notice period in wrongful dismissal cases.  The trial judge found there to be a dearth of
    similar employment available in McNevan’s chosen field of automotive finance.  He noted that McNevan was a manager with a
    major degree of responsibility and the emotional satisfaction that McNevan
    experienced from his work. He also observed that McNevan was 44 years old at
    the time of termination and still had a considerable period of time left in a
    normal work life.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After considering the traditional <i>Bardal </i>factors, the trial judge identified
    AmeriCredit’s “corporate culture” as being one of sharing information, promoting
    open communication and providing regular performance feedback to its employees.  He noted that McNevan had not received “any
    indication whatsoever from his superiors that his job performance was
    unsatisfactory” and therefore he “had no opportunity to change, modify, improve
    or make inquiries of areas where he apparently was not fulfilling his
    role.”  Further, while there was no
    holding out that McNevan’s position would be long-term, the trial judge found
    that it would have been reasonable for him to assume that his position was
    secure given the experience that he brought to the position, and the success he
    had achieved during the year he was with the company. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge held that, in all of these
    circumstances, particularly in the light of the corporate culture, an extended
    notice period of six months was justified. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
page-break-after:avoid;'><b>(2)       The “<i>Wallace</i> extensions”</b></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Next, the trial judge considered McNevan’s claim
    for <i>Wallace</i> damages:  <i>Wallace
    v. United Grain Growers Ltd.</i>, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 701.  He began with what he referred to as “the
    first <i>Wallace</i> factor” – AmeriCredit’s
    failure to warn McNevan of his perceived management failings, combined with the
    abruptness of his dismissal.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge found that given that AmeriCredit
    had not provided McNevan with any feedback, it was reasonable for him to
    believe that he was meeting the company’s expectations.  In the light of the company’s corporate
    policy emphasizing an atmosphere of open communication and regular feedback, the
    trial judge found that the circumstances regarding the termination of McNevan’s
    employment constituted a failure by the company to treat McNevan fairly,
    reasonably, and decently.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge went on to consider the letter
    of termination.  He noted that it
    contained no offer to assist in finding new employment and no offer to provide
    a letter of reference.  He observed that AmeriCredit’s
    offer of three months’ salary in lieu of notice was conditional upon McNevan’s
    signing a release in respect of “any claims whatsoever” including those under the <i>Workers’ Compensation Act</i> and the <i>Workplace Safety and Insurance Act</i>.  Further, the offer indicated no willingness to
    attempt to negotiate a mutually acceptable resolution.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge held that AmeriCredit’s failure
    to warn and the manner of the dismissal was “misleading and insensitive”.  As a result, McNevan suffered increased
    emotional upset, trauma and anxiety.  The
    notice period was therefore extended by three months.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge then turned his attention to
    post-termination conduct – the second so-called “<i>Wallace </i>factor”.  He found
    that AmeriCredit should have known that immediately after being fired, McNevan
    would be in a weakened emotional and economic position.  Notwithstanding, the company failed to make

    manner in dealing with McNevan’s personal property.  The person charged with packing up the items
    in McNevan’s office failed to do so with care and the property arrived in a
    damaged condition.  Further, the human
    resources department mishandled payment to McNevan of his vacation pay.  The error in the calculation was only
    corrected when McNevan pressed the matter.  This lack of care and attention was also evident in the manner in which
    the company handled McNevan’s T4 slip, his Record of Employment, his bonus, and
    a refund on deductions from his paycheque for the Employee Stock Purchase Plan.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge found that this inefficient
    level of performance by a large company with a well-staffed human resources

    it should have taken extra care to honour the remainder of its obligations to
    its former employee.  </p>

    had proven that McNevan failed to mitigate his losses.  He held that it was not unreasonable that it
    took McNevan until October 2002 to begin looking for work.  Given the narrow field in which McNevan was
    looking for comparable employment, the trial judge concluded that AmeriCredit failed
    to meet the onus of demonstrating any failure to mitigate.</p>

    calculate the damages McNevan suffered by reason of being denied the
    opportunity to participate in the Employee Stock Purchase Plan during the
    notice period.  All AmeriCredit employees
    were entitled to purchase company stock, twice a year.  Stock prices were guaranteed for two years
    and could be purchased by employees at a discount of approximately 15%.  McNevan claims that within the 12 month

    parties on this point, namely, the method of valuing the loss of the stock
    purchases, the trial judge noted that the share price was guaranteed by the
    company for a period of two years from the date of purchase, and then used the
    difference between the discounted purchase price on the two days when McNevan
    could have purchased shares and the highest share price within two years from
    the date of the “notional purchases”, and arrived at the figure of $12,984.26.</p>

    in arriving at the figure, the trial judge erred in principle or made an

    properly identified the traditional <i>Bardal </i>factors to be considered in the determination of the reasonable notice
    period.  However, the company submits that
    the trial judge erred by relying on so-called “extended <i>Bardal</i> factors” that are not relevant in the context of a without
    cause termination.  Specifically, the
    trial judge erred by imposing on the company a duty to warn McNevan about dissatisfaction
    in his job performance and then by taking the failure to fulfill that duty into
    account in determining the notice period. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>An employer’s obligations in an action such as
    this arise from an implied term in the employment contract to give reasonable
    notice of termination, or damages in lieu thereof, to the employee in the
    absence of just cause.  While regular and
    candid performance appraisals are undoubtedly helpful for many reasons, McNevan’s
    contract of employment contained no implied term to provide feedback – positive
    or negative – to an employee, as a necessary precursor to dismissal without just
    cause. This is the case regardless of the existence of the corporate culture of
    open communication. </p>

    McNevan was dismissed for cause.  AmeriCredit
    dismissed McNevan without cause on the basis that, rightly or wrongly, it held
    the view that he did not demonstrate that he had the necessary skill set or
    sophistication to manage others.  Given
    the company’s view that there was nothing McNevan could have done to correct
    his problems and salvage his position with the company, a warning would have
    accomplished nothing other than offer McNevan the false hope that he could take

    year-old man, looking for work in a smaller urban area where the opportunities
    to match his skills and experience to an available position were scarce.  The relevant circumstances are such that six

    other inappropriate factors in awarding the first Wallace extension:  the failure to provide a reference letter; the
    failure to offer assistance in a job search; and the offer of three months’
    salary in lieu of notice which was conditional on the signing of a release.</p>

    reference, or for assistance in finding another job.  Further, in the circumstances, I do not
    regard AmeriCredit’s request for McNevan to sign a general release before
    receiving a severance package as high-handed or in bad faith: see Wilson v.
    Goodyear Canada Inc. (2007), 66 B.C.L.R. (4th) 99 (C.A.).  Rather, an offer of severance conditional on

    the level contemplated in <i>Wallace</i>.  Referring specifically to the words of
    Iacobucci J. in <i>Wallace</i> at para. 98,
    there is no evidence that the company, in the manner in which it dealt with
    McNevan after his employment was terminated, engaged in conduct that was
    “untruthful, misleading or unduly insensitive.”  There is no evidence that the company was <i>unduly</i> insensitive in the manner in which it dealt with McNevan’s
    personal property.  It arranged for the
    goods to be packed and for them to be shipped by courier to McNevan.  Unfortunately, in the process, a glass candy
    jar broke and an ice tea can punctured, causing damage to some photographs. Further,
    while there may have been some lack of care and expediency in relation to
    McNevan’s various entitlements arising from his employment and its termination,
    in my view it would be erroneous to characterize the company’s handling of
    McNevan’s vacation pay, the delivery of his T4 and Record of Employment and the

    awarding one extension to compensate for certain bad faith conduct and then a
    separate extension to compensate for other bad faith conduct.  In my view, when taking bad faith conduct on
    the part of the employee into consideration in the context of a wrongful
    dismissal action, the nature of the alleged bad faith should be considered as a
    whole, along with its overall impact upon the employee.  This approach is consistent with that
    sanctioned by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Wallace</i> where, at para. 108, Iacobucci J., for the majority,

    is to be used to determine the proper amount to be paid.”  Rather, bad faith damages are to be
    compensatory based upon actual damages the employee suffers.</p>

    conclusion that the record does not support a finding that AmeriCredit acted in
    bad faith in its dismissal of McNevan.  There can no justification for an extended notice period under <i>Wallace</i>, or a separate damage award

    damages arising from McNevan being unable to purchase AmeriCredit shares under

    based his determination of McNevan’s loss in this regard by taking into account
    the shares he would have purchased during a 12 month notice period.  As I would reduce the notice period to six months,
    this part of the judgment must be reduced accordingly. </p>

'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge approached this part of his task
    by stating that his objective was to put McNevan in a position that he would
    have been in had he worked during the notice period and purchased shares under
    the Plan. The purchase price was straightforward.  It was calculated as the market price of the
    stock on the day when McNevan could have purchased shares, less the employee
    discount of 15%.  The problem lies in the
    determination of the sale price.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Taking into account that the company guaranteed
    the share price for a period of two years from the date of purchase, the trial
    judge decided that the reasonable approach to determining the sale price would
    be to use the highest share value within the two years from the date of the “notional
    purchase”.  McNevan’s loss was then
    valued as the difference between the price of the shares that he could have
    purchased on the two dates, at the discounted price, and the highest share
    value within the two years from the date of the notional purchases.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I agree with AmeriCredit that the trial judge erred
    in his approach to quantifying this aspect of McNevan’s loss as it was
    speculative and based on an unrealistic assumption – that McNevan would have
    been lucky or astute enough to dispose of his shares at the top of the market
    during the two-year period.</p>

'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>  Effectively, what the trial judge was called
    upon to do was value the employment benefit of offering employees the right to
    purchase stock at a 15% discounted price and sell it at 100% of the market
    value on the date of sale, with the share price guaranteed for two years.  Expert evidence could have been put before
    the trial judge to assist in valuing this asset.  Unfortunately, it was not.  In fact, the trial judge was provided with
    little guidance with respect to this aspect of McNevan’s claim.</p>

    and submissions were filed with this court.  In my view, based on the limited evidence and argument on this point,
    the notional sale price should be based on the average market value of the
    shares during the two-year period following the notional purchase.  This approach, among other things, has the
    advantage of being at least less arbitrary and more fair than the method upon
    which the trial judge relied.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I have read the reasons of Epstein J.A. and
    would take a different view of one issue. I am in agreement with her that this
    court should not interfere with the trial judge’s award of six months’ notice,
    nor with his findings that the respondent took reasonable steps to mitigate,
    nor his assessment of the amount of the respondent’s mitigation expenses. I
    also agree that the trial judge’s assessment of the damages flowing from the
    employee stock purchase plan is flawed and must be set aside. While the record
    does not provide sufficient information to enable a definitive calculation of
    these damages, I concur with the methodology Epstein J.A. suggests. However, I
    take a different view of the trial judge’s award of <i>Wallace</i> damages. I would show greater deference to the findings of
    the trial judge regarding the nature of the employment relationship, the manner
    and circumstances of the respondent’s dismissal, and the dismissal’s effects on
    the respondent. I would, though, replace the trial judge’s award of extended
    notice under <i>Wallace</i> to an award of
    monetary damages to reflect the Supreme Court’s recent decision in<i> Honda Canada Inc. v. Keays</i>, [2008]
    S.C.J. No. 40.</p>
  <h3>Notice Period</h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although Epstein J.A. would not disturb the
    trial judge’s award of six months’ notice, she finds that he erred by taking
    into account the appellant’s failure to warn the respondent of his perceived
    management difficulties in determining the period of reasonable notice. She
    points out that an employer’s failure to warn about dissatisfaction in job
    performance is not a relevant consideration in determining the appropriate
    notice period in the context of a without cause dismissal. This conclusion
    affects her analysis of his approach to the <i>Wallace</i> damages as she finds he considered “failure to warn” again at that stage. The
    double counting is one reason she sets aside the award of <i>Wallace</i> damages. In my view, however the trial judge did not
    consider the employer’s “failure to warn” in his assessment of the period of
    reasonable notice. A review of his reasons for awarding six months’ notice is
    necessary to explain why I take this view. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge’s reasons made it clear that he
    accepted the respondent’s submissions that the “most important factor” in
    determining the notice period was the “availability of similar employment”. It
    would be “a virtual impossibility” for the respondent to find comparable
    employment in the field of automotive finance, let alone at the Assistant Vice
    President level. The trial judge found this “critical” factor supported an
    increased notice period. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The second factor the trial judge mentioned was
    the character of the respondent’s employment. He described this factor as both
    “significant” and “important”. The trial judge found the respondent was a
    senior executive with a major degree of responsibility in the company. He was
    professionally qualified in a “narrow specialty” in which he had 19 years of
    experience.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge also noted that the respondent
    was 44 years old at the time of termination and that he still had a
    considerable work life remaining. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge’s analysis and discussion of the
    above factors reflect a classic <i>Bardal</i> approach to the assessment of reasonable notice. I agree with Epstein J.A. that
    these factors would support the award of six months notice. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge, however, went further. He went
    on to describe in some detail the respondent’s performance and accomplishments.
    In doing so he pointed out that the respondent had never received any
    indication that there was any dissatisfaction with his job performance or his
    management style. Quite the contrary, as the trial judge highlighted, the
    respondent’s department had received commendations from the appellant. In the
    course of these observations the trial judge stated that the respondent had had
    no opportunity to make the changes required to satisfy his superiors.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>These comments of the trial judge, considered on
    their own, could be understood to show he took into account the employer’s
    failure to warn even though he did not use those specific words. However, on my
    reading of his reasons, the trial judge made these observations to support his
    conclusion that the respondent was dismissed from “long-term employment”. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After making the above observations, the trial
    judge remarked that, despite any specific discussion at the time of hiring that
    the respondent was being offered “long-term employment”, it was a reasonable
    conclusion that he enjoyed long term employment. Alluding to his earlier
    comments, the trial judge stated that “reinforcing the impression would be the
    fact that he had received no negative feedback and that his departments had
    been generally successful.” The trial judge then added that “this factor also
    needs to be considered in the context of the company’s ‘corporate culture’.” He
    pointed out that the appellant had made great efforts to promote its corporate
    culture, which emphasized, among other things, “the importance of sharing
    information, promoting open communication, measuring performance and providing
    regular feedback and treating their employees with respect.”  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In my view, these observations were part of the
    rationale why the trial judge found that the way that the appellant dealt with
    and communicated with him made the respondent’s impression his employment was
    “long term” reasonable in the circumstances.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As I read his reasons, the trial judge’s
    assessment of the notice period was based on his view that the respondent was a
    senior manager with specialized qualifications and experience who was
    terminated from long-term employment with an almost complete unavailability of
    similar employment. These findings support an award of 6 months’ notice. </p>
  <h3><span style='font-style:normal'>Wallace</span> damages</h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In his written submissions the respondent argues
    that the <i>Honda</i> case should not be
    applied to this case as the parties have already gone through a trial and an
    appeal relying on the law articulated in <i>Wallace</i>.
    I do not agree. This case is still before the courts, and in making its
    decision the court must apply the existing law. There is no unfairness as the
    parties were allowed to make written submissions on the import of <i>Honda.</i>  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Honda</i>,
    the Supreme Court revised its approach to an award of damages for manner of
    dismissal. Under the revised approach, such damages are only available if the
    mental distress suffered by the terminated employee meets the following
    conditions:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            1) the mental distress suffered is beyond the normal
    distress and hurt feelings that result from dismissal from employment; and </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            2) it was within the reasonable contemplation of the
    parties at the time of contract formation that a breach of the contract in
    certain circumstances would cause the plaintiff particular mental distress.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If these conditions are met, damages will be available
    only if they result from the circumstances described in <i>Wallace</i>, namely--where the employer engages in conduct during the
    course of dismissal that is “unfair or is in bad faith by being, for example,
    untruthful, misleading or unduly insensitive”. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[95]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, under the revised approach, the remedy
    is no longer an extension of the notice period as under <i>Wallace</i>, but rather a monetary award that reflects the actual
    damages suffered. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In this case the task of re-examining the trial
    judge’s findings on the <i>Wallace</i> issue
    through the lens of the <i>Honda</i> decision is not difficult<i>. </i>While the
    trial judge may have chosen his words differently had the <i>Honda</i> decision been available, he did find, as I explain below,
    that the respondent suffered more than ordinary mental distress and that the
    mental distress that the respondent suffered was within the reasonable
    contemplation of the parties. Since these prerequisites are met, damages for
    mental distress should be available if they result from the “circumstances
    described in <i>Wallace</i>” as Bastarache
    J. stated at para. 57 of <i>Honda.</i> The
    trial judge found the <i>Wallace</i> standard was met, and a review of his reasons for so finding is
    straightforward.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[97]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In regards to the first preliminary condition
    for damages under <i>Honda</i>, the trial
    judge accepted that the termination left the respondent “totally devastated”
    and caused him to feel overwhelmed, dejected, depressed, agitated and unable to
    sleep. It was necessary for him to go to his doctor for feelings of depression
    and sleeplessness. The trial judge found the conduct of the appellant to be
    “misleading” and “insensitive”. He found that the appellant’s conduct
    “increased the ‘expected’ emotional upset, trauma and anxiety for the
    plaintiff” and “resulted in increased intangible injuries.” The trial judge
    found that certain aspects of the appellant’s conduct “would naturally have
    increased the Plaintiff’s anxiety, frustration and upset” while other aspects
    “would naturally have increased the Plaintiff’s level of anxiety in the
    circumstances.” and still others would have “increased the level of indignity
    that the Plaintiff was already experiencing.” I am satisfied that the trial
    judge found, in effect, that the respondent suffered mental distress beyond the
    normal distress and hurt feelings that result from dismissal from employment. </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[98]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Turning to what was in the contemplation of the
    parties, in <i>Ditchburn v. Landis &amp; Gyr
    Powers, Ltd</i>., [1997] O.J. No. 2401, this court upheld a trial judge’s award
    of $15,000 in additional compensation for mental distress suffered by a
    terminated employee. Goudge J.A. found no error in the trial judge’s reasoning
    that the parties must have contemplated that a sudden and unlawful discharge in
    the circumstances would cause the respondent mental distress. The case was
    decided before <i>Wallace</i> but, in some
    ways, foreshadows the Supreme’s Courts approach in <i>Honda.</i>  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[99]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As in <i>Ditchburn</i>,
    the trial judge in this case found that the appellant was terminated suddenly
    when he had the reasonable expectation of long term employment. It was in the
    context of the parties’ expectations that the trial judge stressed that the appellant’s
    policies emphasized “teambuilding, practising open communication, regular
    feedback and treating the team members with respect” and that the respondent had
    only received positive feedback. Rather than open communication and feedback,
    the letter of termination that was “handed” to him at the time of his dismissal
    left him wondering why he had been terminated. He asked his superior for the
    reasons for his dismissal and received only “a general response”. He asked his
    superior to try and arrange a meeting with the senior vice president to “get an
    explanation for his termination” and though there was some preliminary

    trial judge stopped short of finding that the duty to warn was an implied term
    of the contract. Rather, he quoted Iacobucci J.’s reference in <i>Wallace</i>, (para. 108) to “the abrupt
    manner in which Wallace was dismissed despite having received compliments on
    his work from his superiors only days before” as example of bad faith. The
    trial judge took the view that the respondent’s termination was abrupt. </p>

    trial judge found that the appellant failed to treat the respondent “fairly,
    reasonably, and decently”, a phrase Iacobucci J. used in <i>Wallace</i> (para. 107). He found the conduct of the appellant was
    “misleading and insensitive” and demonstrated “callousness” in the manner of
    the respondent’s dismissal.  </p>

    reaching these conclusions the trial judge was entitled to consider, as he did,
    some events that occurred after the respondent was handed the termination
    letter. The scope of a judge’s inquiry into a claim for damages for mental
    distress is not limited to the manner in which the employee is informed that
    they are dismissed. It extends to matters that form part of the context that
    fuelled and surrounded the dismissal. In <i>Gismondi
    v.
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto
    (City)</i>, [2003] O.J. No. 1490, Rosenberg J.A. speaking for this court (para.
    23) accepted that <i>Wallace</i> damages are
    not limited to acts of the employer at the very moment of dismissal, but can include
    “the employer’s conduct pre- and post-termination ... and the conduct of the
    employer in its aftermath” as long as they are components of the manner of
    dismissal. In <i>Lowndes v. Summit Ford
    Sales Ltd.</i>, [2006] O.J. No. 13, Cronk J.A., approved of the trial judge
    having looked at events that predated the actual dismissal because “they form
    part of the context that fuelled and eventually surrounded the dismissal itself”
    (para. 19). In <i>Mulvihill v.
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Ottawa (City)</i>, 2008
    ONCA 201 this court focused on events that occurred both before and after the
    termination letter that was sent to the plaintiff. Gillese J.A. said “What <i>Wallace</i> requires is an examination of
    the manner of dismissal, taking into account the full context of the employment
    relationship.”  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[103]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, the trial judge could view the manner in which the appellant dealt
    with the respondent’s personal property and the manner it dealt with his
    statutory entitlements and termination documents as components of the manner of
    his dismissal. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    this court in <i>Mulvihill</i> found that a
    mistake will not furnish a basis for <i>Wallace</i> damages, here the trial judge found there was a “litany of mistakes” that would
    support a finding of recklessness on the part of the employer. The appellant
    cited no authority that deliberate or intentional conduct<i> </i>is required for the finding of <i>Wallace</i> damages. Indeed, in <i>Wallace</i> both the Manitoba
    Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Canada agreed that the impugned
    conduct of the employer fell short of any independent actionable wrong (para.
    74) including<i> </i>the tort of intentional
    infliction<i> </i>of mental suffering (para.
    33).  Likewise, under <i>Honda, </i>the issue is simply whether the
    employee suffered mental distress beyond the ordinary within the contemplation
    of the parties. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is useful to review some of the trial judge’s findings regarding the “litany of
    errors<i>” c</i>ommitted by the employer in
    the handling of the respondent’s statutory entitlements and termination
    documents. These include the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Wingdings;
'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondent was entitled by law to receive
    his vacation pay automatically within seven days. He eventually received the
    final portion of his vacation pay some four years and three months after his
    termination. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Wingdings;
'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>He did not receive his T4 when entitled to by
    law and had to instruct his lawyer to write the appellant asking for it. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Wingdings;
'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>He did not receive his Record of Employment as
    required by law and had to contact the appellant to ask for it. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Wingdings;
'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>He was entitled by his employment contract to a
    bonus in early August 2002. His claim for a bonus was not resolved until
    October 2003 after he made several inquiries about it. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Wingdings;
'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A refund in respect of deductions from his pay
    check for employee stock purchases went missing and was not reissued to the
    plaintiff until a year later. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge found that “this inefficient level of performance would have
    increased the level of indignity that the [respondent] was already
    experiencing” and that the appellant “should have known that this would likely
    add to [the respondent’s] humiliation and frustration.”  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view there was evidence to support all of the trial judge’s findings of
    fact. It is worth repeating the caution of Gillese J.A. in <i>Mulvihill </i>at paragraph 46:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A trial judge’s
    determination that an employer has, when dismissing an employee, engaged in bad
    faith conduct or unfair treatment is based on findings of fact. As an appellate
    court, we must show appropriate deference to those factual findings; they are not
    to be set aside absent palpable and overriding error.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Lowndes </i>(para. 18) Cronk J.A.
    indicated that grounds for appellate intervention are required even when the
    case for <i>Wallace</i> damages is not
    strong.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this case it seems to me that the appellant seeks to quarrel with the findings
    of the trial judge. I would conclude that the appellant has failed to
    demonstrate sufficient grounds for appellate intervention.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Given
    that this case falls within the transition period from the <i>Wallace</i> regime to the <i>Honda</i> regime, this court must assess the respondent’s mental distress according to
    the findings of the trial judge. I would award the respondent $30,000 to
    compensate him for the mental distress he suffered beyond what might be
    normally expected upon termination from employment. The elimination of the
    extended notice granted by the trial judge under <i>Wallace</i> affects the respondent’s entitlement under the employee
    stock purchase plan. His entitlement must be calculated on the basis of only
    six months notice. As stated in my introduction I concur with Epstein J.A.’s
    approach to the calculation of the respondent’s damages arising from the
    employee stock purchase plan. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    conclusion, I would dispose of the appeal as Epstein J.A. does, except in
    regard to the damages for mental distress. In that regard, I agree the trial
    judge’s award of six months’ extended notice under <i>Wallace</i> should be set aside, but I would replace that award with an
    award of $30,000 for mental distress. I agree with Epstein J.A.’s disposition
    of costs as success is divided. </p>
