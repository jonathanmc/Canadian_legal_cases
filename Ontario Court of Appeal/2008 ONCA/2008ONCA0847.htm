    erred in holding that the respondent, Hepburn, was entitled to an enhanced
    supplementary pension based on crediting him with an additional 36 months
    service towards his pensionable earnings.  The trial judge based his decision on equitable principles of
    rectification, trust law and promissory estoppel.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the wording of the letter
    agreement entered into by the parties governs and that the trial judge erred in
    granting relief on equitable principles. </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In 1998, Jannock’s Board of Directors decided to
    sell a division of the company, the Brick Group.  The President (Atkinson) and VP, Human
    Resources (Kerry) began a process of negotiating an agreement with the
    respondent Hepburn, who was President of the Brick Group at the time.  Jannock encouraged Hepburn to obtain
    independent legal advice and agreed to pay for that advice.  Hepburn took them up on the offer and
    retained a partner at BLG in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The agreement was eventually reduced to writing
    in the form of a Letter Agreement.  The
    Letter Agreement contained a termination upon sale of business clause as
    follows: </p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><span
lang=EN-US>3.         Termination
    of Employment Upon

  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><span lang=EN-US>In the event that a Sale of Business is
    concluded and you do not accept employment with the purchaser(s), with Jannock
    or with any of its affiliates and your employment is terminated by Jannock, you
    will receive:</span></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><span lang=EN-US>…</span></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><span lang=EN-US>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Your
    insured health benefit and life insurance coverage (with the exception of
    disability benefits) will be continued for the lesser of a period of 36 months
    or until you are eligible to receive reasonably equivalent benefit coverage
    through other employment, and subject to the terms of the insurance contracts
    in effect between Jannock and its insurers.  The pension benefit shall be calculated and paid out as if accrual
    continued for a 36-month period following termination, regardless of whether
    new employment is obtained.  The accrual
    of retirement benefits will be based upon compensation in effect at the time of
    termination of employment.  Vacation
    accrual will cease as of the date of termination of employment.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Hepburn provided his counsel with a copy of the Letter
    Agreement and subsequently met with his counsel to discuss its terms. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Hepburn testified at trial that he received advice from
    his counsel that if he wanted to “bullet-proof” s. 3(b), the words “with the
    purchaser or otherwise” should be added after the words “whether new employment
    is obtained” to ensure that he would be entitled to the 36-month credit if he
    took up employment with the purchaser of the Brick Group.  Hepburn further testified that he told this to
    Kerry who in turn told him that the recommended language was redundant.  In addition, he testified that Kerry had
    promised that the 36-month credit would be payable in any event. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Kerry does not recall such a discussion and, as a
    result, the appellant takes issue with whether a specific assurance to Hepburn
    was provided by Kerry prior to the execution of the Letter Agreement.  The trial judge appears to have accepted
    Hepburn’s evidence on this point.  Kerry’s evidence is consistent with previous change of control
    agreements between Jannock and the executives regarding pension benefits. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is no issue that Kerry always understood that the
    36-month credit would be payable in any event. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sale of the Brick Group closed on May 14, 1999.  Hepburn then took up employment with the
    purchaser, Hanson Building Materials America.  Prior to the sale, Kerry and Atkinson knew
    that Hepburn would be taking up employment with Hanson and Kerry had earlier
    requested that Jannock’s pension actuary prepare illustrations setting out the
    pension entitlements of Hepburn.  According
    to the respondent, these illustrations were consistent with Hepburn’s and
    Kerry’s understanding, that he would receive the 36-month credit if he took up
    employment with Hanson.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In March, 2000, Jannock was acquired by the appellant
    Magnatrax.  Prior to the closing of the
    sale to Magnatrax, Kerry was involved with preparing a valuation of pension
    entitlements.  At the time, Kerry
    confirmed to Jannock’s pension plan actuary that Hepburn was entitled to the
    additional 36-month accrual.  In
    accordance with the actuary’s advice, Jannock paid $1,052,000 into trust on
    March 9, 2000, an amount which represented the expected eventual payout to
    Hepburn.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Magnatrax
    subsequently amalgamated into a new company, the appellant, Vicwest.  Following the amalgamation, Vicwest’s counsel
    wrote to Hepburn and advised him of the company’s position that Hepburn was not
    entitled to the 36-month credit since he had taken up employment with Hanson.
    Hepburn then commenced his action.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 2003, the appellants filed under the CCAA and
    chapter 11 of the <i>United States
    Bankruptcy Code</i> resulting in a stay of Hepburn’s action.  Following these applications, a plan of
    arrangement was sanctioned by the Superior Court of Justice on August 12, 2003.
     Hepburn was granted leave to continue
    this action for the purpose of obtaining a declaration as to his entitlement to
    the 36 months credit.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Decision</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge held that Vicwest should not be
    allowed to take back the money that Jannock had put in place to fund Hepburn’s
    entitlement to the 36-month credit when it sold the Brick Group division.  There is ample evidence to support the trial
    judge’s conclusion.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The clear intention of the parties was that the
    respondent would receive the additional 36-month credit towards his pensionable
    earnings irrespective of whether he took up a position with the company to
    which the Brick Group was sold. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In relation to rectification, the trial judge
    found that the parties had a prior oral agreement that the respondent would
    receive the 36 month credit.  The wording
    that the parties chose to use did not give effect to this mutual intention.  They were mutually mistaken in thinking that
    the letter agreement did implement their intention.  Actions by Kerry that reinforce the notion of
    this mutual oral understanding include the fact that he:</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>prepared cost models for the Compensation
    Committee which included the cost of an additional 36 months of pension accrual
    for Hepburn;</p>

    reflecting the entitlement;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>ultimately saw that Jannock paid into the
    pension trust the amount required to fully fund Hepburn’s entitlement.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To allow Vicwest to take advantage of this mistake
    would be unfair and satisfies the “equivalent of fraud” requirement for
    rectification as that term is defined in <i>Sulvan
    Lake Performance Industries Ltd. v.
    Sylvan Lake Golf &amp; Tennis Club Ltd.</i>, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 678 at para. 39 to
    mean unfair dealing and unconscionable conduct.  In this case, Vicwest would be taking unfair advantage of a mutual
    mistake by Jannock and Hepburn to obtain that which it had not bargained for if
    it is allowed have the return of the money.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The fact that the letter agreement was not amended,
    although Hepburn obtained independent legal advice that he could bullet proof
    the wording of the letter agreement by adding the phrase “whether employment is
    obtained with the purchaser or otherwise”, does not detract from the conclusion
    that a mutual mistake was made.  In
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    <i>Sylvan</i><i>
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Lake</i><i>, supra, </i>at para. 66, the Supreme Court
    rejected the argument that due diligence was a condition precedent to
    rectification.  The trial judge did not
    err in rectifying the letter agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> We also agree
    with the trial judge’s alternative conclusion that promissory estoppel applied
    to prevent the appellant from succeeding.  Kerry, on behalf of Jannock, made an unequivocal assurance that was
    intended to affect the legal relations between the parties upon which Hepburn
    acted when he took up employment with Hancock.  The successor to the person who made the assurance cannot claim to revert
    to the situation as if such assurance had not been made.  In light of the foregoing there is no need
    for us to address the time issue.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, we would dismiss the appeal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Costs of the appeal are agreed at $30,000 all inclusive
    on a partial indemnity basis.  We
    therefore order that costs of $30,000 all inclusive be paid by the appellant to
    the respondent Hepburn.  The respondent
    Trust Company of the Bank of Montreal took no position on this appeal and no
    costs are awarded for or against it. </p>
