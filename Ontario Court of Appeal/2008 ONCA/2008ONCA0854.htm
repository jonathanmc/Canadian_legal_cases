    degree murder of his wife.  The applicant
    was convicted by court composed of Wein J. and a jury but that conviction was
    set aside and a new trial ordered on November 30, 2005.  This court’s reasons for allowing the appeal
    are reported at 203 C.C.C. (3d) 341.  The
    applicant’s second trial before Speyer J. ended in a mistrial on November 16,
    2006, when the jury was unable to reach a verdict.  His third trial for first degree murder

  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The
    Police Informer Ground of Appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>About one month after the killing, the police received
    information from a confidential informer that associates had told him they had
    been involved in a break-in, in the area where the appellant and deceased lived,
    during which a woman had been struck in the head.  The informer identified two men as the people
    involved.  These two men were interviewed
    by the police and denied any involvement.  Both men, including Brian Greystone who was said to be the killer,
    testified before the trial judge on the <i>voir
    dire</i> to determine whether the informer’s identity should be disclosed.  Greystone and his associate denied committing
    the break-in.  As a result, the applicant
    sought to have the confidential informer testify on the basis that his evidence
    of what Greystone and his associate said would be admissible under the
    principled approach to hearsay.  Defence
    counsel suggested that the trial judge first hear the informer <i>in camera</i> in the absence of the
    applicant and his counsel to determine whether the circumstances in which the
    statement the informer attributes to Greystone were made would meet the
    requirements of threshold reliability.  The parties later agreed to a somewhat different procedure whereby a
    senior Crown counsel interviewed the informer.  The transcript of that interview was made available to the trial judge,
    but not the applicant and his counsel.  On consent, transcript was provided to me and I have reviewed it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have reviewed Dawson J.’s rulings related to this
    issue; the two most important being reported at [2007] O.J. No. 5457 and [2007]
    O.J. No. 5460.  It seems clear from the
    trial judge’s second ruling that the informer was mistaken in identifying
    Greystone and his associate.  The trial
    judge refused to disclose the names of the persons who the informer did have
    the conversation with because to do so would inevitably result in the
    disclosure of the informer’s identity.  The
    trial judge was also of the view that the circumstances under which the
    conversation took place were so unreliable that the conversation would never be
    admissible under the principled approach to the hearsay rule.  Having reviewed the trial judge’s rulings and
    the transcript of the interview, I cannot say that the trial judge erred.  As the trial judge said in his second ruling,
    the circumstances under which these statements were made were very unreliable.  Further, as the trial judge noted at para. 15
    of his ruling there was good reason to doubt that the information from the
    informer relates to the Klymchuk homicide.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicant submits that the trial judge
    misapprehended the innocence at stake exception to the police informer
    rule.  He says that the fact that
    identification of the names of the parties to the conversation might result in
    disclosure of the informer’s identity misses the point.  If disclosure of the informer’s identity is
    necessary to establish the accused’s innocence then the privilege must give
    way.  Second, the value of obtaining the
    informer’s identity did not turn simply on the hearsay conversation.  Rather, the defence might have been able to
    obtain information from the informer that could lead to identification of a
    viable third party suspect.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having regard to the material before the trial judge
    and the manner in which the issue was argued before the trial judge, it is my
    view that this is a tenuous ground of appeal.  As I have said, the trial judge’s ruling that the informer’s statements
    would not be substantively admissible appears to be correct.  On the material that I have reviewed, the
    possibility that further investigation could result in a reasonable doubt is
    speculative.  As the trial judge said at
    para. 15 of his ruling, “A substantial element of subjective interpretation of
    events by the informant is now apparent [as a result of the interview with
    Crown counsel] and weakens the link between the comments made to the informant
    and the offence before the court.” While the informer privilege will be set
    aside in the interests of the accused’s innocence, there must be an evidentiary
    basis to conclude that the informer possesses information that could raise a
    reasonable doubt: see <i>R. v. Marshall</i> (2005), 77 O.R. (3d) 87 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">

  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The
    Reasonableness of the Verdict</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicant argues that the verdict was the product
    of an unreasonable compromise.  In
    considering this ground of appeal I have had the benefit of the charge to the
    jury and counsels’ closing jury addresses.  The theory of the Crown was that only the applicant had a motive for
    murdering the deceased and the Crown sought to establish his identity largely
    by proving that he staged the scene.  The
    applicant argues that the jury could not on the one hand be satisfied of the
    accused’s identity and yet reject first degree murder.  He argues that it was impossible for the
    applicant to have staged the scene after an intentional but spontaneous
    killing.  In other words, the same
    evidence that established identity also established that the killing was planned
    and deliberate. The applicant argues that the jury must have rejected the
    staging theory and what remained of the Crown’s case was not sufficient to
    found a conviction for murder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown’s case against the applicant rested on
    motive, opportunity and the evidence of staging.  There was some other circumstantial evidence
    in the form of some alleged inconsistencies in the applicant’s statements to
    the police, but this evidence was not particularly strong.  There was also some evidence of statements by
    the applicant prior to the murder suggesting that he did not intend to stay
    with the deceased any longer.  Nevertheless, I tend to agree with the applicant that the staging
    evidence was crucial to the Crown’s case on identification.  As this court said in the first appeal:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>It was central
    to the Crown’s case that the crime scene was staged to make it appear as though
    there had been a break-in when in fact there had been no break-in.  A finding by the jury that the crime scene
    was staged would go a long way to the conviction of the appellant.  On the evidence, he was the only person with
    a motive to kill Mrs. Klymchuk and a reason to stage the crime scene to make it
    appear as though there had been a break-in.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In other words, I tend to agree with the applicant that
    for the jury to convict the applicant of murder they had to be satisfied that
    he staged the scene.  Where I part
    company with the applicant is the submission that having found the scene to
    have been staged, the jury was bound to find that the killing was planned and
    deliberate.  This was not the view of the
    trial judge.  He instructed the jury that
    if the applicant “did manipulate the crime scene to simulate a break-in, but
    only thought of that after he killed his wife, then this evidence cannot be
    considered as evidence showing planning and deliberation of her murder”.  There was no objection by defence counsel at
    trial to this direction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While it was unquestionably the Crown’s theory that the
    crime scene manipulation was too elaborate to be an afterthought, the jury was
    not bound to accept that theory.  See <i>R. v. Ranger</i> (2003), 67 C.C.C. (3d) 1 at
    para. 135.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I also note that Crown counsel, albeit in passing, did
    suggest that the jury could convict the applicant of second degree murder.  He said the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Before the break
    I suggested to you that the only real question you should have, then, is, when
    did he decide to do it? Was it impulsive? Did he kill her in the heat of the
    moment or was this something that he had planned and thought about? It’s possible
    he may have gone out to the drive shed with Maria to discuss Robyn Mays and
    their marriage and when he told her she reacted, as her friends said that she
    would, because she wouldn’t have tolerated infidelity. He may have grabbed her
    from behind, she went for the door, they struggled briefly, but eventually from
    the pressure he applied to her neck she fell to the floor unconscious. Maybe,
    because he thought she was already dead, he decided then to hit her with the
    axe and then fake a break and enter. That’s certainly a possibility and
    emotionally it’s more palatable. Emotionally, because of Kristian and
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Elizabeth, that’s what I
    think we’d all like to prefer happened; and if that’s what you decide happened
    and that’s all you decide that happened beyond a reasonable doubt, you would
    find Mr. Klymchuk guilty of second degree murder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Admittedly, Crown counsel then went on to develop his
    theory that the more rational view of the evidence was that this was a planned
    and deliberate murder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the record before me, it would not be unreasonable
    for the jury to conclude that the crime scene manipulation was an
    afterthought.  As I understand the
    evidence, approximately two hours elapsed between the last time the deceased
    was seen alive and the applicant called 911 to report the killing.  The staging evidence as reviewed in the
    charge to the jury would not have taken a great deal of time consisting, as I
    understand it, of cutting the screen, breaking the window track, placing some
    footprints on the window frame, moving the snow blower outside and disposing of
    blood-stained clothing and the footwear used to make the impressions on the
    window.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I stress that I have reached this conclusion on the
    very limited record before me, consisting of the charge to the jury, counsels’
    addresses and trial counsel’s opinion to legal aid.  This was a long and complex trial and it may
    well be that on a more complete record, this ground of appeal would be
    considerably more formidable.  I can only
    say that on this record, the ground of appeal is not substantial.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The Public
    Interest</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R. v.
    Farinacci</i> (1993), 86 .C.C.C. (3d) 32 (Ont. C.A.) at 47-8, Arbour J.A.
    considered the public interest as applied to applications for bail pending
    appeal.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Section
    679(3)(c) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> provides, in my opinion, a clear standard against which the correctness of any
    decision granting or denying bail pending appeal can be reviewed. The concerns
    reflecting public interest, as expressed in the case-law, relate both to the
    protection and safety of the public and to the need to maintain a balance
    between the competing dictates of enforceability and reviewability. It is the
    need to maintain that balance which is expressed by reference to the public
    image of the criminal law, or the public confidence in the administration of
    justice. The &quot;public interest&quot; criterion in s. 679(3)(c) of the <i>Code</i> requires a judicial assessment of
    the need to review the conviction leading to imprisonment, in which case
    execution of the sentence may have to be temporarily suspended, and the need to
    respect the general rule of immediate enforceability of judgments.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Public
    confidence in the administration of justice requires that judgments be
    enforced. The public interest may require that a person convicted of a very
    serious offence, particularly a repeat offender who is advancing grounds of
    appeal that are arguable but weak, be denied bail. In such a case, the grounds
    favouring enforceability need not yield to the grounds favouring reviewability.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>On the other
    hand, public confidence in the administration of justice requires that
    judgments be reviewed and that errors, if any, be corrected. This is
    particularly so in the criminal field where liberty is at stake. Public
    confidence would be shaken, in my view, if a youthful first offender, sentenced
    to a few months' imprisonment for a property offence, was compelled to serve
    his or her entire sentence before having an opportunity to challenge the
    conviction on appeal. Assuming that the requirements of s. 679(3)(a) and (b) of
    the <i>Criminal Code</i> are met,
    entitlement to bail is strongest when denial of bail would render the appeal
    nugatory, for all practical purposes. This same principle animates the civil
    law dealing with stays of judgments and orders pending appeal. It is a
    principle which vindicates the value of reviewability.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the interest in enforceability presently
    outweighs the interest in reviewability.  The appellant has now twice been convicted of murder.  The Crown’s case while circumstantial is not
    insubstantial.  While I cannot say that
    either ground of appeal is frivolous, they do not appear to be very
    strong.  At this time, the public
    interest favours denying bail pending appeal.  It is only in unusual circumstances, where the grounds of appeal appear
    to be strong, that this court has released an appellant pending appeal from
    conviction for first or second degree murder.  I have not been persuaded that this is one of those cases.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the application for bail pending appeal is

    different theory of liability to the jury than urged by the Crown, the
    appellate court must consider two questions.  First, is there an evidentiary basis for the alternative theory?  Second, if so, was the accused prejudiced by
    the manner in which the alternative theory was placed before the jury.  In this case, the applicant did not suggest
    before me that he was unfairly disadvantaged.  The issue then is whether the verdict was unreasonable because of the
    lack of evidentiary foundation for second degree murder.  </p>
