    murder.  There is no issue that the
    appellant caused the victim’s death.  She
    inflicted the mortal stab wound in the full view of several eye-witnesses.  This attack was preceded by a dispute between
    the appellant and the victim, both drug users.  The night before the stabbing, the appellant, the victim and the owner
    of the house where the appellant was staying smoked cocaine together. The next
    morning, apparently believing that the appellant had stolen her hair-care
    products, the victim went back to the house where she ransacked the appellant’s
    belongings.  She was heard to say that if
    the appellant were present, she would kick or beat the appellant’s head
    in.  Later in the day, the appellant was
    told that the victim was looking for her and was going to “kick her ass”.  Following a heated telephone exchange during
    which the appellant threatened to kill the victim, the appellant confronted the
    victim and fatally stabbed her in the chest with a steak knife.</p>

  <p><b>ANALYSIS</b></p>
  <p><b><i>1. Post-offence conduct</i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Evidence was led as to the appellant’s conduct
    immediately after the stabbing. According to some children who had witnessed
    the stabbing, the appellant threatened them that if they did not keep quiet she
    would kill them.  There was also evidence
    that the appellant threw the knife into a sewer, ran away, then returned to the
    scene and made efforts to help the victim.  When she was arrested at the scene for murder, the appellant initially
    denied involvement in the killing but then said “tell my kids I'll see them in 20
    years”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge gave the following instruction in
    relation to the post-offence conduct evidence:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>What a person says or
    does after a crime was committed may help you decide whether it was that person
    who committed it.  It may help.  It may not.  The words or conduct may indicate that Sandra
    Kimberly Gould intentionally committed a crime.  On the other hand, the words or conduct may be
    those of an innocent person who simply wants to avoid involvement in a police
    investigation or that of a person who is frightened and needs time to think
    about a traumatic experience, or in a panic. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The first thing to decide is whether Sandra
    Kimberly Gould actually did or said these things.  If you find that she did not do or say these
    things, you must not consider this evidence in reaching your verdict.  If you find that Sandra Kimberly Gould did in
    fact do or say these things, you should consider next whether this was because
    Sandra Kimberly Gould committed the offence charged, or for some other reason.  If you find that what Sandra Kimberly Gould
    said or did afterwards is consistent with her being conscious of having done
    what is alleged against her, and not for some other reason, you may consider
    this evidence together with all the other evidence in reaching your verdict.  If you do not or cannot find that Sandra
    Kimberly Gould said or did those things for that reason, you must not consider
    this evidence in this way.  It is for you
    to decide, based on the evidence as a whole, whether Sandra Kimberly Gould's
    after the fact conduct is not attributable to the charge, but that for example
    she was scared and wanted time to think clearly.  It is for you to decide whether the after the
    fact conduct was related to the charge before you, rather than to some other
    possible culpable act.  It is for you to
    consider the weight, if any, such evidence should be accorded in your final
    determination of guilt or innocence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant acknowledges that on the facts of this
    case, the post-offence conduct evidence could have been relevant to self-defence,
    provocation and intoxication.  The
    appellant submits, however, that the jury should have been specifically
    instructed that the post-offence conduct was relevant to self-defence,
    provocation and intoxication and that it had no bearing on the issue of whether
    the Crown had proved the requisite <i>mens
    rea</i> for murder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant relies on a line of authority holding
    that while post-offence conduct may suggest that the accused committed a
    culpable homicide, it may not assist in determining whether the accused
    committed murder or manslaughter: see <i>R.
    v. Peavoy </i>(1997), 34 O.R. (3d) 620 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ); <i>R. v. Diu</i> (2000), 49 O.R. (3d) 40 (
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ); <i>R. v. Figueroa</i>, 2008 ONCA 106.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the following reasons, I am not persuaded in the
    circumstances of this case that the trial judge erred in his instructions
    relating to the use the jury could make of the post-offence conduct evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, as I have already noted, the appellant concedes
    that the post-offence conduct was arguably relevant to two issues bearing on
    whether the appellant was guilty of murder or manslaughter: intoxication and
    provocation.  The appellant’s
    post-offence conduct could have been used by the jury to determine whether she
    was so intoxicated that she could not have intended to kill or whether she was
    so provoked as to have lost self-control.  Accordingly, on the facts of this case, it would not have been
    appropriate for the trial judge to instruct the jury that the post-offence
    conduct evidence had no bearing on the issue of whether the appellant was
    guilty of murder or manslaughter.  A more
    complex instruction would have been required.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the trial judge did caution the jury regarding
    the use of post-offence conduct evidence.  He told the jury that the appellant’s actions
    following the offence could be “those of an innocent person who simply wants to
    avoid involvement in a police investigation or that of a person who is
    frightened and needs time to think about a traumatic experience, or in a panic.”
     He also explained that it was for the
    jury to decide whether the appellant’s actions were attributable to the offence
    charged or merely indicated that “she was scared and wanted time to think
    clearly” and that it was for the jury “to decide whether the after the fact
    conduct was related to the charge… rather than to some other possible culpable
    act.”  While this instruction lacks the
    specificity sought by the appellant, it accurately conveyed the fundamental
    point that the jury should exercise care and caution in the use of the post-offence
    conduct evidence and that the jury should not assume that this evidence
    supported a finding of guilt for murder. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, the appellant’s submission must be considered in
    the light of the positions taken at trial.  The Crown did not invite the jury to make
    inappropriate use of the post-offence conduct.  The appellant’s trial counsel relied on the
    post-offence conduct to reduce murder to manslaughter.  He argued that the post-offence conduct
    buttressed her claim that she was drugged, panicked and not thinking clearly
    and that she did not intend to kill the victim.  Moreover, in a pre-charge conference, the
    trial judge provided counsel with a written copy of his proposed instructions.  The appellant’s trial counsel did not object
    to the post-offence conduct instruction, either then or following the delivery
    of the charge. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am not persuaded that, in the circumstances of this
    case, the trial judge’s failure to give the jury an instruction along the lines
    now requested by the appellant amounts to an error that prejudiced the
    appellant or that would justify appellate intervention.</p>
  <p><b><i>2.
    The “common sense inference” </i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the trial judge
    overemphasized the common sense inference that persons are taken to intend the
    natural and probable consequences of their acts.  The appellant submits that the trial judge’s repeated
    references to the common sense inference could well have diverted the jury's
    attention from the fundamental proposition that it was for the Crown to prove
    the requisite <i>mens rea</i> beyond a
    reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.  It is well-established that the common sense
    inference instruction should be given to the jury in a case like the present
    one: see <i>R. v. Seymour, </i>[1996] 2
    S.C.R. 252, at para. 19.  The trial judge
    instructed the jury several times that there was no burden on the defence.  He told the jury that the Crown bore the
    burden of proof on all elements of the offence and on demonstrating that the
    appellant had not acted in self-defence, under provocation or that she was so
    intoxicated as to have lacked the requisite intent for murder. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not agree with the appellant that the trial
    judge’s instruction that evidence of intoxication may “rebut” the common sense
    inference in any way suggested to the jury that the onus was on the appellant
    to prove intoxication.  Indeed, the
    authorities establish that the jury should be instructed that evidence of
    intoxication may rebut the common sense inference: see <i>R. v. Robinson</i>, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 683, at para. 65; <i>Seymour</i>, at para. 23.  Nor do I accept the appellant’s submission
    that in the circumstances of this case the trial judge’s failure to define
    “recklessness” when relating and explaining the <i>mens rea</i> for murder under s. 229(a) of the <i>Criminal Code </i>could have left the jury with the impression that the
    standard to be applied was objective rather than subjective.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When read as a whole, I am satisfied that the
    instruction brought home to the jury that the common sense inference could not
    and did not displace the burden on the Crown that remained throughout to prove
    all aspects of the case against the appellant beyond a reasonable doubt. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, I note that, here as well, the appellant’s
    trial counsel did not object to this aspect of the charge either during the
    pre-charge conference or after the charge was delivered. </p>
  <p><b><i>3. Rolled-up charge</i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that the judge erred by failing
    to give a sufficient “rolled-up” charge with respect to the <i>mens rea</i> for
    murder.  Specifically, the appellant
    submits that the effect of the trial judge’s charge was to exclude from the
    jury’s consideration evidence that tended to support, but that fell short, of
    self-defence or provocation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge gave the following “rolled-up” charge: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Even if you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt
    that when she caused Jennifer Hillis’s death, in deciding whether Sandra
    Kimberly Gould had the state of mind required to make the unlawful killing of
    Jennifer Hillis murder, you must consider the evidence of Sandra Kimberly
    Gould's drug consumption, anger, and fear.  You should consider this evidence as well,
    apart altogether from what I will tell you later about provocation, not just by
    itself on the particular issue to which it relates, but all together and along
    with any other evidence that might suggest that Sandra Kimberly Gould acted
    instinctively in the sudden excitement of the moment, without thinking about
    the consequences of what she did, and without the state of mind necessary to
    make the unlawful killing of Jennifer Hillis murder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, this instruction was adequate.  When read in the light of the balance of the
    charge and in the context of the facts of this case, it brought home to the
    jury that they were to consider any and all evidence that had a bearing on the
    issue of the <i>mens rea</i> required for
    murder.  By referring to “drug
    consumption, anger, and fear” the trial judge used non-technical but readily
    comprehensible language to capture the meaning behind the more formal legal
    categories of intoxication, provocation and self-defence.  The jury was told to consider that evidence on
    the issue of intention, quite apart from whatever bearing it might have on the
    issues of intoxication, provocation and self-defence, together with any other
    evidence that might suggest that the appellant had acted in an instinctive,
    impulsive or unthinking manner when she stabbed the victim.  In my view, the charge left<span lang=EN-GB> the jury with the c</span>lear understanding
    that they were<span lang=EN-GB> to consider the
    cumulative effect of all the evidence.  </span>Again,
    it is noteworthy that although a more expansive or detailed instruction could
    have been given, the appellant’s trial counsel did not request such an
    instruction upon reviewing the draft charge and did not object after the charge
    was delivered.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, I would not give effect to this ground of
    appeal. </p>
