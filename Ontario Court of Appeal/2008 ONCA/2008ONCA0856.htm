    counts of knowingly participating in or contributing to a terrorist group
    contrary to s. 83.18(1) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>.  Three times he has applied for
    bail, once to a Justice of the Peace and twice to different superior court
    judges.  Three times his application has
    been rejected.</p>

    court review the third denial of bail.  This application poses questions about the interpretation of ss. 520 and
    523 of the <i>Code</i>, as well the question
    of whether this court should decline to exercise the concurrent jurisdiction it
    holds along with the Superior Court to make the order sought by the applicant.</p>

    interim release since his arrest.  Shortly after his arrest, the applicant was denied bail by Justice of
    the Peace Fallon on August 15, 2006. During the preliminary inquiry, Dawson J.
    of the Superior Court of Justice denied bail on July 26, 2007.  Finally, after the filing of the direct
    indictment, Hill J. of the Superior Court of Justice rejected the applicant’s
    fresh application for bail on June 6, 2008.</p>

    sections 523(2)(a) and 520 of the <i>Criminal
    Code:</i>:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>Is
    the applicant precluded from making this application in this court because his
    trial has started for the purposes of s. 523(2)(a) of the <i>Code</i> and therefore it is only the trial judge who can conduct a
    bail review at this stage of the proceedings?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>If
    the trial has not started for the purposes of s. 523(2)(a), and s. 520 of the <i>Code</i> governs the application, should
    this court decline to exercise its jurisdiction in favour of the admitted
    jurisdiction of the Superior Court of Justice?</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>D.<u> ANALYSIS</u></span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>            <u>Section 523(2)(a) of the <i>Criminal Code</i></u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent contends that the applicant’s trial has
    commenced and, accordingly, by virtue of s. 523(2)(a) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, this court has no
    jurisdiction to review Hill J.’s order denying bail to the applicant.  Section 523(2)(a) provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>523(2) Notwithstanding subsections (1) and (1.1),</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) the court, judge or justice <i>before whom an accused is being tried</i>,
    at any time,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>may, on cause being shown, vacate any order
    previously made under this Part for the interim release or detention of the
    accused and make any other order provided for in this Part for the detention or
    release of the accused until his trial is completed that the court, judge or
    justice considers to be warranted.  [Emphasis added]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R. v.
    Basarabas</i>, [1982] 2 S.C.R. 730, the Supreme Court of
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    discussed in a general way when a jury trial commences.  Dickson J. stated at 740-41:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The question of fixing the time of the commencement
    of a jury trial has been the subject of some difficulty in the past.  It seems possible, however, on the
    authorities and on principle to reach the following conclusions.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>First, the time of commencement of a jury trial
    will vary according to the circumstances and the language of the section of the
    Criminal Code being applied.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>. . .</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Finally, the weight of authority supports the
    position of the accused that a jury trial commences when the accused has been
    placed in charge of the jury.  Canadian
    courts have frequently cited the judgment of Ritchie C.J. [in <i>R. v.</i> <i>Morin </i>(1890), 18 S.C.R. 407] in support of a narrow interpretation
    of the word “trial” in respect of a jury trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In a similar vein, in <i>Hertrich, Stewart and Skinner</i> (1982), 67 C.C.C. (2d) 510 (On.
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), Martin
    J.A. provided a fulsome description of the components of a trial, at 527:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>“[T]rial” for the purpose of the principle that an
    accused is entitled to be present at his trial clearly includes proceedings
    which are part of the normal trial process for determining the guilt or
    innocence of the accused such as arraignment and plea, the empanelling of the
    jury, the reception of evidence (including <i>voir
    dire</i> proceedings with respect to the admissibility of evidence), rulings on
    evidence, arguments of counsel, addresses of counsel to the jury, the judge’s
    charge, including requests by the jury for further instructions, the reception
    of the verdict and the imposition of sentence if the accused is found guilty.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This description was approved by the Supreme Court of
    Canada in <i>R. v. Vézina; R. v. Coté</i>,
    [1986] 1 S.C.R. 2 and <i>R. v. Barrow</i>,
    [1987] 2 S.C.R. 694.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>None of these cases dealt with bail reviews.  However in <i>R. v. McCreery</i> (1996), 110 C.C.C. (3d) 561 (B.C.S.C.), Romilly J.
    considered all of these cases and concluded that, for bail purposes, a trial
    did not commence until the accused was put in charge of the jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his valuable text, <i>The Law of Bail in Canada</i> (
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto:
    Thomson Canada Ltd., 1999), Gary Trotter (now Justice Trotter) described and
    considered <i>McCreery</i> and concluded, at
    347:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The approach in <i>McCreery</i> is sound.  It is faithful to the wording
    of s. 523(2)(a) and the review provisions as a whole.  It is an approach that is fair to
    litigants.  The normal avenues of
    pre-trial review (ss. 520, 521 and 680) remain available until the trial
    actually gets underway.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree.  In the
    present case, it is true that a trial judge has been designated and that he has
    been hearing a variety of pre-trial motions for several months.  However, the applicant has not been
    arraigned, nor has he entered a plea.<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  Moreover, it appears from the record that the
    pre-trial motions may continue for many more months.  In these circumstances, I do not think that
    the applicant, per s. 523(2)(a) of the <i>Code</i>,
    “is being tried”, at least for purposes of the bail provisions of the <i>Code.</i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the applicant’s request for bail must be
    determined under s. 520 of the <i>Code</i>,
    an inquiry to which I now turn.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><u><span lang=EN-US>(2) s. 520 of the <i>Criminal Code</i></span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a preliminary point, I note that there is concurrent
    jurisdiction in the Superior Court and this court to conduct a bail review
    under s. 520 of the <i>Code</i>. Once it has
    been determined that the applicant’s trial has not commenced for bail purposes,
    his application for a review of Hill J.’s order denying him bail becomes
    governed by s. 520 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>,
    which provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>520(1) If a justice … makes an order under
    subsection 515(2), (5), (6), (7), (8) or (12) … the accused may, <i>at any time before the trial of the charge</i>,
    apply to a judge for a review of the order.  [Emphasis added]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 493 of the <i>Code</i> defines “judge” as “in the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Province
    of
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Ontario, a judge of
    the superior court of criminal jurisdiction of the Province.” In s. 2 of the <i>Code</i>, “superior court of criminal
    jurisdiction” is defined as “in the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Province
    of
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Ontario, the Court of
    Appeal or the Superior Court of Justice.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The question raised
    by this appeal is whether, in a clear concurrent jurisdiction situation, the
    Court of Appeal should exercise or decline its jurisdiction to hear a bail
    review application in the circumstances of this case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Historically, most courts of appeal in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    have
    been reluctant to exercise their concurrent jurisdiction in this domain.  As explained by Trotter in <i>The Law of Bail in Canada</i>, at 301-02:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>While there is concurrent jurisdiction under ss.
    520 and 521 in two levels of court in most provinces, the overwhelming majority
    of bail reviews are heard in the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Superior
    or Supreme Court.  The courts of appeal
    have shown great reluctance to exercise their jurisdiction under ss. 520 or 521.  Attempts to invoke the jurisdiction of an
    appeal court judge in these circumstances often occur after an application has
    already been heard in the Superior Court pursuant to ss. 520 or 521.  On numerous occasions, appellate judges have
    said that the jurisdiction of a judge of a court of appeal ought to be invoked
    only in “special” or “exceptional” circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the second edition of <i>The Law of Bail in Canada</i> was published in 1999, this passage is
    still valid.  By my count, the courts of
    appeal in four provinces decline to exercise their concurrent jurisdiction
    under s. 520 of the <i>Code</i> absent
    special or exceptional circumstances: see <i>R.

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In only one province, British Columbia, does it appear
    that a court of appeal will exercise its concurrent jurisdiction under s. 520
    of the <i>Code</i> as a matter of course:
    see <i>R. v. Vukelich</i> (1993), 32
    B.C.A.C. 81 (Wood J.A. in Chambers); and <i> R.. v. Massey</i>, 2005 BCCA 174 (Saunders
    J.A. in Chambers).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the provinces where courts of appeal decline to
    exercise their concurrent jurisdiction to conduct bail reviews under s. 520 of
    the <i>Code</i> absent special
    circumstances, what constitutes special circumstances has been defined quite
    narrowly.  Some examples of special
    circumstances include: where there has been a substantial period of delay due
    to the absence of a transcript from the bail review, the superior court judge
    refused to proceed without the transcript, and it is essential and urgent that
    the matter be dealt with (<i>R. v. Carrier</i> 51 (1979), C.C.C. (2d) 307 cited in <i>Mallett)</i>;
    where no superior court judge is readily available (<i>Mallett</i>); and where two superior court judges on two bail
    applications applied differing interpretations of s. 515 of the <i>Code</i> and the case law (<i>Smith</i>). Of course, none of these
    exceptions applies in the present case.  In
    his submissions, the applicant raises a number of arguments in order to
    overcome this problem.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the applicant asserts that in Ontario, the
    British Columbia practice of exercising the concurrent jurisdiction provided in
    s. 520 of the <i>Code</i>, represented by <i>Vukelich</i>, should be preferred over the
    ‘special circumstances’ jurisprudence applied in New Brunswick, Manitoba,
    Saskatchewan and Alberta. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the applicant appears to suggest that, in the
    alternative, the special circumstance test should not be applied in this case
    as it is only applied in s. 520 cases that do not involve direct indictments. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, and partly in conjunction with his second
    argument, the applicant submits that to allow another superior court judge to
    review the bail order of a fellow judge on the same court is not in keeping with
    the hierarchical scheme of the bail system in Canada. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The applicant’s second argument can be quickly
    addressed. Appellate level courts have applied the special circumstances test
    in cases of direct indictment. In fact, several of the case authorities on the
    interpretation of the jurisdictional issue in s. 520 of the <i>Code</i> were direct indictment cases: see <i>MacIver, Zeneli</i> and <i>Chan</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In response to the applicant’s first argument, although
    courts may not be uniform in their application of the special circumstances
    test, the overwhelming majority of appellate decisions on this topic favours
    the use of the test in cases such as these. Indeed, in response to the
    applicant’s third argument, it becomes clear why I believe that the special circumstances
    test should be adopted in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario,
    and further why a direct indictment charge does not qualify as a special
    circumstance. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his submissions, the applicant emphasizes that his
    trial is now proceeding as a direct indictment trial.  It follows that the first bail review, after
    the direct indictment was preferred, was conducted by a superior court judge
    and, if I decline to exercise this court’s jurisdiction, the next bail review
    will also be conducted by a superior court judge.  This reality, says the applicant, ignores the
    fact that in most cases there is no direct indictment and the initial bail
    order made by a provincial court judge will be reviewed by a superior court
    judge.  Accordingly, there is a disconnect
    between the hierarchy anchor in many bail review situations and the absence of
    such an anchor in direct indictment cases if courts of appeal do not exercise
    their concurrent jurisdiction under s. 520 as a matter of course. The need for
    this hierarchy, as explained by the applicant’s counsel in his oral
    submissions, is the difficulty a superior court judge might have in reviewing
    the merits of an order written by a colleague.  As counsel for the applicant put it, “I do not want to go before a
    co-ordinate judge in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Brampton
    to review Hill J.’s decision.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, the overarching problem with this hierarchy
    argument is that it finds no support in – indeed it is contrary to – the
    wording of s. 520.  Section 520 clearly
    envisions more than one opportunity to bring a bail review application and contemplates
    that different judges of the superior court will sometimes hear these
    applications.  The hearing will often be
    a blending of the original material and the material before the judge on any
    prior review and the order made by that judge with new material that has arisen
    subsequent to the initial hearing: see <i>R.
    v. Saracino</i> (1989), 47 C.C.C. (3d) 185 at 190-91 (Ont. H.C. per Doherty J.).  In other words, s. 520 of the <i>Code</i> explicitly contemplates that, in
    reviewing an order made at a show cause hearing under s.520, one superior court
    judge may consider the order made by another judge of the same court on a prior
    review application.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> As to the
    argument that one superior court judge should not review the decision of
    another, I agree with Huband J.A.’s rejection of this notion in <i>Zeneli</i>, at 480:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Crown counsel submit that special circumstances
    exist because of an error of law on the part of Menzies J. in failing to
    provide reasons for his decision in spite of a statutory requirement to do
    so.  It is argued that this distinguishes
    the present case from the usual situation where changed circumstances are
    alleged.  It is further suggested that
    another judge of the Court of Queen’s Bench might be reluctant to find judicial
    error.  Further, if judicial error were
    to be found, allowing a fresh discretion to be exercised, a judge of the Court
    of Queen’s Bench might be reluctant to come to a different conclusion than his
    or her colleague on the Court of Queen’s Bench.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my opinion, the fact that the intended review is
    based initially on an alleged error of law does not, by itself, qualify as a
    special circumstance justifying a judge of this court to entertain a
    review.  In my opinion, judges of the
    Court of Queen’s Bench will fulfil their responsibilities by finding judicial
    error if error indeed exists and by exercising an independent discretion if the
    circumstances call for an independent discretion.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, I note that s. 520 is not the only provision
    of the <i>Code</i> assigning jurisdiction to
    coordinate members of the same court in the bail domain; s. 680 of the <i>Code</i> establishes a similar mechanism for
    courts of appeal with respect to bail orders pending appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I make one final observation.  In my view, there are strong policy and
    practical reasons for adopting the ‘special circumstance’ overlay to the
    concurrent jurisdiction set out in s. 520 of the <i>Code</i>.  First, if evidence is
    to be heard at the bail review, the Superior Court is better positioned to hear
    the review; it has the facilities, staff and mechanisms to respond to this
    necessity: see <i>Petrie,</i> <i>Seminick, </i>and <i>R. v. Ranger </i>(2003),<i> <span
style='color:black'><span style='color:black;text-decoration:none;text-underline:
none'>180 O.A.C. 138</span></span> (On. C.A)(Feldman J.A. in Chambers).</i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, there are many other provisions in the <i>Criminal Code</i> that confer concurrent
    jurisdiction on a court of appeal as a “superior court of criminal
    jurisdiction”, but an appellate court would rarely, if ever, exercise those
    powers for practical and policy reasons: see, for example, ss. 184.2, 184.3,
    185, 186, 187, 188 and 196 (wiretaps); s. 258 (release of blood samples for
    testing); ss. 468 and 470 (trying indictable offences); s. 488.1 (examination
    of seized solicitor-client privileged documents; s. 490 (retention orders in
    relation to items seized); s. 490.2 (forfeiture of offence related property);
    and s. 699 (insurance of out-of-province subpoena).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I conclude that, absent special circumstances, courts
    of appeal should deal with bail pending appeal and superior courts should deal
    with bail prior to and during a trial.  The applicant has not established special circumstances to justify the
    intervention of this court in his case.</p>

    the applicant had been arraigned and entered a plea of not guilty, as is
    sometimes the practice as lengthy pre-trial motions begin, my conclusion would
    be the same, since the procedure would have to be repeated in the presence of
    the panel as jury selection began. Only after jury selection had been completed
    would the applicant have been given in charge of the jury and the trial begun.</p>
