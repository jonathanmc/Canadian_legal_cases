line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants raise two issues on appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    they submit that the application judge erred in finding that the pylon sign
    in the engineering drawings accords with the terms of the lease. That finding,
    they submit, does not fit with the evidence and amounts to an impermissible
    rewriting of the terms of the lease. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    particular, the appellants argue that the lease refers to “a rental area
    of approximately 4 sq. ft. for the footprint (base) of the pylon”, whereas
    the engineering drawings show the footprint (base) as being a 70 sq. ft.
    above-ground pedestal. The appellants further complain about the placement
    of the pylon. In the engineering drawings, it is located approximately 13
    ft. south west of the location provided in the lease.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to the size of the footprint (base), the application judge made the
    following observations: (1) the lease did not limit the size of the foundation
    needed to support the pylon; (2) the appellants accepted that the foundation
    could be greater than 4 sq. ft.; (3) the engineering evidence provided that “the
    foundation of the sign includes the [70 sq. ft.] pedestal”; and (4) the pylon
    to be erected measured 5 ft in diameter and it was to be mounted on a metal
    plate which sat on top of the pedestal and measured 6 ft in diameter.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Taking
    those factors together, although she did not say so explicitly, it is apparent
    that the application judge considered that the 70 sq. ft. pedestal formed
    part of the foundation and as such, it did not offend the terms of the lease. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge concluded her analysis of this issue by noting that the
    parties “understood and intended that the dimensions set out in the lease
    were of necessity imprecise and were subject to change once the [engineering]
    drawings had been completed.” In our view, that finding was open to the application
    judge having regard to the following considerations: (1) the language of
    the lease in describing the dimensions of the footprint uses the word “approximately”;
    (2) the word “footprint” is not itself a defined term and on the evidence,
    it is apparently not a term used in the description of the construction of
    these types of signs; (3) the word
    “suitable” was used to describe the foundation, indicating an attempt to
    rely on others with expertise to fix the exact dimensions and location necessary
    to properly erect these types of signs; and (4) Exhibit E to the lease is
    a picture of a “sample billboard structure to be placed”. The picture demonstrates
    that the size of the pole itself is considerably larger than 4 sq. ft.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge made a similar finding in relation to the precise location
    of the pylon. That too was something that the parties understood would not
    be finalized until the completion of the engineering drawings and they were
    content to sign the lease on that basis. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the record supports the application judge’s ultimate conclusion
    that the provisions of the lease were “not precise with respect to the size
    and location of the sign structure”. Accordingly, it was open to the application
    judge to conclude that engineering drawings accords with the terms of the
    lease. In coming to this conclusion it is not necessary to have regard to
    the evidence of industry practice. We do not accept the submission that this
    interpretation leads to a commercial absurdity. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the first ground of appeal must fail.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second ground of appeal concerns the application judge’s decision to order
    the trial of an issue on the question of remedy and specifically, whether
    the respondent can obtain specific performance. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants submit that the application judge was wrong to even consider the
    remedy of specific performance, since it was not pleaded. Alternatively,  they
    submit that it is not available on the evidence as there is no basis for
    concluding that the property and the lease are “unique” and the respondent
    can be adequately compensated by an award of damages. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    disagree with both of these submissions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge recognized that the remedy of specific performance had
    not been pleaded. Nonetheless, she concluded that the appellants were not
    prejudiced by this and she gave the parties ample opportunity to address
    the issue. She was entitled to exercise her discretion in that fashion and
    we see no basis for interfering. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    for the second argument, while we acknowledge that the remedy of specific
    performance may be difficult to establish, we think it was open to the application
    judge to treat it as a live issue in the particular circumstances of this
    case. Accordingly, she did not err in ordering the trial of an issue on the
    question of remedy. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> For
    these reasons, the appeal must be dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Costs
    to the respondent are fixed in the amount of $7,264 inclusive of disbursements
    and G.S.T.</p>
