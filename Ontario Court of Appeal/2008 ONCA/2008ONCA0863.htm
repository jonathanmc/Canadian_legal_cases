    33 Yonge Street, in the City of

    many years, Shopsy’s Hospitality Inc. (“SHI”) has operated a Shopsy’s delicatessen
    at the Leased Premises pursuant to an original lease dated November 15, 1982,
    the term of which was extended or renewed by written agreement on five separate
    occasions (collectively, the
    “Lease”).  Under its current terms, the Lease is set to expire on December
    31, 2008.  It contains no right of renewal or extension in favour of SHI.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    June 1, 2006, the appellant, Irish Pub Development Corp., carrying on business
    as Embassy Hospitality Group (“IPD”), wrote to the respondent GWL Realty
    Advisors Inc. (“GWL”) – the property manager representative of the respondents
    1213763 Ontario Inc. and London Life Insurance Company (the “Landlords”) – and
    expressed interest in renting the Leased Premises.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    its letter, IPD indicated: (i) its awareness that the Lease had a “short
    term remaining”, that the Leased Premises are a
    “prime location”, and that the Landlords “may already have parties interested
    in locating there”; (ii) that it had made a proposal to a food service company
    to acquire, among other businesses, the Shopsy’s delicatessen at the Leased
    Premises; (iii) that if it was successful with its acquisition proposal but
    was not able to negotiate a lease extension with the Landlords concerning
    the Leased Premises, it would plan “a modest make-over” of the Leased Premises
    for the remaining term of the Lease; and (iv) conversely, if it was successful
    with both its acquisition plan and its negotiations with the Landlords for “a
    longer term lease”, it “could envisage spending from $750,000 to $1 million
    to bring an Upgraded ‘Premium Casual Deli Restaurant’ into that market but
    under the existing [Shopsy’s] brand name” and it would “start to overhaul
    the premises immediately”.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Discussions
    then ensued between IPD and the Landlords, during which IPD learned that
    another established
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Toronto restaurateur, Oliver Bonacini Restaurants (“Oliver”), held a right
    of first offer over the Leased Premises should the Landlords seek to rent
    the Leased Premises to a party other than SHI.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>IPD
    claims that at its initial meeting with the Landlords’ representatives in
    mid-June 2006, it made clear to the Landlords that it was unwilling to compete
    with Oliver for the rental of the Leased Premises.  IPD further asserts that
    the Landlords represented to it that they had refused to consider Oliver
    as a tenant of the Leased Premises and that if the Lease was amended and
    its term was extended while SHI remained the tenant of the Leased Premises,
    Oliver’s right of first offer would not be triggered.  As a result, IPD says,
    it was understood that in order to rent the Leased Premises and avoid Oliver’s
    right of first offer, it would be necessary for IPD to acquire control of
    SHI.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    July 4, 2006, IPD wrote to GWL, indicating that it had executed an agreement
    with the various parties involved with the ownership of SHI regarding the
    acquisition of all Shopsy’s delicatessen locations.  In that letter, IPD
    also stated:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[I]n order to commit to a full agreement with SHI,
    we will need to work with you on an accelerated time basis regarding 33 Yonge
    Street, if that is possible and available from your perspective.  While we
    understand that it may not be realistic to conclude a full and binding lease
    agreement within that time, we would be prepared to make our decisions with
    SHI on the basis of a summary offer and commitment with you that highlights
    the major business terms for a lease.  Accordingly we feel that we have to
    accelerate our discussions with you and determine immediately the fundamental
    lease conditions – subject of course that our business model and renderings
    will ultimately be acceptable to you.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>As a result, although we are in the midst of completing
    our work for presentation to you we are writing to see if you would nevertheless
    be willing to accelerate discussions and start meeting with us now with the
    objective of reaching a conclusion on the fundamental business terms for
    the space.  We are aware that by asking you to work within a limited time
    frame we may be pre-empting your desired approach for dealing with competing
    proposals by Peter Oliver or others and ourselves for the space.  Unfortunately
    we have had no choice in establishing the time lines for our transaction
    with SHI and although we are very motivated to close with SHI and include
    all of their operations it is imperative for us to know the status for an
    extension at 33 Yonge before doing so.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>33 Yonge represents a tremendous long term opportunity
    for both of us but it will be expensive and we unfortunately would prefer
    to pass on good opportunities rather than assume risks that we cannot fully
    assess.  We need to have some certainty about the space within the next 25
    days and we will need an unusual type of co-operation from you to do so.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>GWL
    responded to this letter on July 20, 2006.  In its response, GWL indicated
    that “it is important to maintain the formality with respect to the documentation
    surrounding [the] lease” and advised that the Landlords would require receipt
    of a request for an extension of the term of the Lease.  GWL also stated: “Although
    the Landlord has several third party tenants interested in this locations,
    [<i>sic</i>] should the Landlord agree to such … extension of lease term …
    many amendments to the existing lease would be made … .”  GWL then set out
    a number of proposed lease terms for the Leased Premises, including provisions
    for an extended lease term, a fixturing period, basic, additional and percentage
    rent, the permitted use of the Leased Premises and design work (the “Term
    Sheet”).  GWL expressly indicated that these terms were non-exhaustive.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Shortly
    thereafter, IPD proceeded to purchase SHI.  The closing of at least part
    of that transaction took place on August 28, 2006 – before any formal written
    extension or renewal agreement had been entered into with the Landlords regarding
    the Lease.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>By
    the fall of 2006, IPD was in possession of and operating the Shopsy’s delicatessen
    at the Leased Premises and the Landlords were dealing with IPD, as the new
    owner of SHI, in its capacity as the tenant of the Leased Premises under
    the existing Lease.  However, the parties had still not concluded any formal
    written extension or renewal agreement concerning the Lease.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>IPD
    maintains that by September of 2006, it had fulfilled all the agreed conditions
    to obtain an extension or renewal of the Lease, save only for the Landlords’ approval
    of IPD’s drawings or renderings for a new restaurant at the Leased Premises.  IPD
    contends that by virtue of their dealings in June and July 2006 –
    including, especially, the Term Sheet – the parties entered into a binding
    conditional contract for the extension or renewal of the Lease in favour
    of SHI on terms that were certain and enforceable, save only for the Landlords’
    approval of IPD’s drawings for a new restaurant, which had yet to be presented
    to the Landlords or their representatives.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    early November 2006, approximately five months after its initial meeting
    with the Landlords, IPD presented its concept drawings to the Landlords.  Although
    the drawings initially met with enthusiasm from the Landlords’ involved representatives,
    senior management of the Landlords subsequently rejected the design proposal
    depicted in the drawings.  Shortly thereafter, the Landlords entered into
    a lease agreement with Oliver for the Leased Premises.</p>
  <h2>(2)       The Litigation</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Litigation
    followed rapidly.  On November 8, 2007, the Landlords brought an application
    seeking, among other relief, declarations that the Lease expires on December
    31, 2008 and that SHI has no right to occupy the Leased Premises thereafter,
    and an order requiring SHI to deliver vacant possession of the Leased Premises
    to the Landlords on or before December 31, 2008.  On January 29, 2008, the
    appellants also applied for various relief, including declarations that the
    Lease was “extended and amended” by the Landlords in favour of SHI on the
    terms described in the Term Sheet and that SHI is entitled to quiet enjoyment
    of the Leased Premises in accordance with the Lease “as extended and amended”.  The
    relief sought by the parties in their competing applications exclusively
    concerned the interpretation of the Lease and the alleged contractual rights
    of the appellants in relation to the Leased Premises.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    applications were heard together on April 22 and April 25, 2008.  The application
    judge held that the parties did not conclude an agreement regarding the extension
    or renewal of the Lease and that “no new lease or lease renewal was reached”.  By
    judgment dated May 15, 2008, she granted the relief sought by the Landlords
    and dismissed the appellants’ companion application.</p>
  <h2>(3)       Discussion</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants raise two main issues on appeal.  First, they attack the application
    judge’s factual findings on the ground that she erred by making findings
    of fact: (i) that allegedly are not supported by, and are inconsistent with,
    uncontroverted evidence that the application judge failed to consider; and
    (ii) that turn on credibility assessments made without the requisite underlying
    credibility findings and the benefit of a trial.  Second, the appellants
    submit that the application judge misapprehended the nature of their argument
    that the Landlords were estopped from adducing evidence that countered or
    contradicted the appellants’ assertion that the Landlords made representations
    to IPD, on which IPD relied to its detriment.  I would reject these arguments
    for the following reasons.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    in my view, the application judge’s key factual finding that no binding extension
    or renewal agreement in respect of the Lease was reached by the parties is
    amply supported by the record.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    record indicates that at the time of its initial June 1, 2006 correspondence
    with GWL, IPD had already proposed to acquire the Shopsy’s delicatessen at
    the Leased Premises.  In its June 1, 2006 letter to GWL, IPD disclosed its
    intention to operate that Shopsy’s delicatessen for the remainder of the
    term of the existing Lease even if an agreement for a longer-term lease of
    the Leased Premises could not be concluded with the Landlords.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although
    IPD later sought confirmation of the business terms required by the Landlords
    to complete an extension or renewal of the Lease, thereby precipitating the
    delivery of the Term Sheet, IPD closed the transaction of purchase and sale
    regarding the Shopsy’s delicatessen at the Leased Premises, at least partially,
    without advising the Landlords of the intended closing and without a firm
    written extension or renewal agreement in place.  It did so notwithstanding
    GWL’s blunt caution in the Term Sheet that it was “important to maintain
    the formality with respect to the documentation surrounding [the] lease” and
    GWL’s concurrent warning that if the Landlords agreed to an extension of
    the term of the Lease, “many amendments to the existing lease would be made”,
    only some of which were detailed in the Term Sheet.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus,
    by July 20, 2006 – before the completion of IPD’s acquisition of SHI – IPD
    knew that the Term Sheet did not reflect all the Lease amendments required
    by the Landlords.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>That
    IPD knew that the provisions of the Term Sheet did not encompass all the
    requisite Lease amendments was confirmed by IPD on July 26, 2006 in an e-mail
    to GWL’s senior leasing manager in which IPD acknowledged receipt of the
    Term Sheet, “outlining <i>some</i> of the Landlord’s requirements for a new
    lease” (emphasis added).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Then,
    on September 7, 2006, IPD again e-mailed GWL’s senior leasing manager, advancing
    an explanation for IPD’s delay in communicating with the Landlords and stating,
    in part:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>We have … finally signed a purchase and sale agreement
    that requires landlord approvals for all 3 [Shopsy’s] locations.  We can
    pick the sites we want and naturally want Front <i>if we can come to agreeable
    terms for a new lease, which I am sure we can</i>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    e-mail thus again confirmed IPD’s understanding, as at September 7, 2006,
    that the parties had not yet finalized the terms of a mutually acceptable
    leasing arrangement for the Leased Premises.  Rather, the parties continued
    to be engaged in negotiations.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    almost two months later – on October 27, 2006 – IPD sent a further e-mail
    to GWL’s senior leasing manager in which it said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[O]ur purchase is still subject to a recission arrangement
    with Mark Weber in our favour – we feel it would be prudent to deal with
    major issues such as the floor costs <i>once we know better what our long
    term tenancy prospects appeared to be with you. …</i> </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Hopefully we can finalize things soon … we are very
    anxious to show you our drawings.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>These
    communications from IPD to the Landlords’
    leasing representative belie the appellants’ claim that the Term Sheet constituted
    a binding conditional contract for the extension or renewal of the Lease.  IPD,
    by its own conduct, acknowledged that no enforceable renewal or extension
    agreement was settled by the parties in the Term Sheet, or otherwise, prior
    to the presentation by IPD of its development concept drawings to the Landlords
    in November 2006.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    the appellants complain that the application judge erred by making factual
    findings that required a trial to ground credibility assessments.  However,
    the appellants cannot be heard to rely on conflicts in the evidence that
    were obvious in the materials filed in respect of the competing applications
    before the application judge as the basis for subsequently arguing on appeal
    that the matters in issue should have been determined by way of the trial
    of an issue or a full trial on the merits.  The appellants elected to proceed
    with duelling applications, in the face of conflicting evidence, and were
    content for the application judge to decide the matters in issue based on
    the record before her.  It is not open to the appellants to now resile from
    that decision.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> Finally,
    I do not accept the appellants’ contention that the application judge misapprehended
    the nature of their estoppel argument or otherwise misapplied the doctrine
    of estoppel in the circumstances of this case.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Before
    this court, the appellants readily acknowledged that the doctrine of estoppel
    is not the basis for their claims against the Landlords.  They maintain that
    they invoked estoppel “from an evidentiary perspective only”, for the purpose
    of precluding the Landlords from adducing evidence that countered the appellants’ claim
    that the Land-lords represented to them that the Landlords would not deal
    with or entertain a leasing proposal from Oliver, instead preferring to deal
    with the appellants.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Assuming
    without deciding that estoppel could operate as a matter of law in this case
    in the fashion posited by the appellants, the record once again undercuts
    the position advanced by the appellants.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants claim that by acquiring SHI at a time when a formal written extension
    or renewal of the Lease had not been entered into with the Landlords, IPD
    relied to its detriment on representations by the Landlords that they would
    not consider Oliver as a potential competing tenant.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>But
    IPD’s own correspondence with the Landlords reveals the appellants’ awareness
    of Oliver’s continuing interest in the Leased Premises.  In an e-mail from
    IPD to the Landlords’ leasing manager dated August 2, 2006, IPD recounted
    that in a recent meeting with the leasing manager, “it came up that Peter
    Oliver may be interested in the Shopsy’s space as well”.  As a result, IPD
    requested confidentiality in respect of its dealings with the Landlords.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    this communication, which post-dated the Term Sheet and <i>pre-dated</i> the
    appellants’ partial closing of the SHI acquisition, contained no request
    for confirmation from the Landlords or GWL that Oliver’s potential involvement
    as a prospective tenant was not a factor.  Nor did it contain any complaint
    by IPD that the Landlords may be considering Oliver as a potential tenant
    for the Leased Premises.  The Landlords’ subsequent communications with the
    appellants regarding Oliver post-dated the appellants’ purchase of SHI.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    these circumstances, I am not persuaded that the doctrine of estoppel assists
    the appellants in the manner urged by them.</p>
  <h2>(4)       Disposition</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    record reveals that there was conflicting evidence before the application
    judge on many aspects of the dealings between the parties.  However, on the
    whole of the record, there was clear evidential support for the application
    judge’s conclusion that the parties were engaged in negotiations that did
    not produce an enforceable agreement to renew or extend the Lease.  Based
    on the undisputed parts of the record, particularly IPD’s own communications
    with the Landlords, I agree with the application judge’s holding that no
    extension of the Lease and “no new lease or lease renewal” was concluded
    in favour of SHI.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    the reasons given, I would dismiss the appeal.  The respondents shall deliver
    their brief written submissions on the costs of this appeal to the Registrar
    of this court within ten days from the date of these reasons.  The appellants
    shall deliver their brief responding costs submissions to the Registrar within
    ten days thereafter.</p>
