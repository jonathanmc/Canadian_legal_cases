    Concrete Forming Ltd. (hereafter referred to as A.C. Concrete or the appellant)
    carries on business as a low rise forming contractor in the greater
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Toronto area.  It is a small contractor with only a small number of employees – between
    seven and fifteen at the relevant times.  The Association is an accredited
    employers’ organization within the meaning of the <i>Labour Relations Act,
    1995</i>, S.O. 1995, c. 1, Sch. A. (the “Act”).  Piccininni is the General
    Manager of the Association.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A.C.
    Concrete was a member of the Association from February 20, 1998, until its
    resignation on April 8, 2004.  The Association is the exclusive statutory
    bargaining agent for all employers bound by the collective agreement between
    the Association and the Universal Workers Union, LIUNA, Local 183 (the “Collective
    Agreement”), even if the employer is not a member of the Association, as
    in A.C. Concrete’s case.  The Association and the union have been parties
    to the Collective Agreement at all relevant times; the Collective Agreement
    covers employees working in the low rise residential formwork industry.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Article
    10.02 in Schedule A to the Collective Agreement requires all employers bound
    by it to contribute $1.20 per hour for each hour worked by employees covered
    by the Collective Agreement.  Thus, even though a non-member of the Association,
    A.C. Concrete was obliged to remit such monies.  The money is remitted to
    Local 183 which retains $0.20 per hour for each hour worked by each employee
    for its training fund.  Local 183 pays the remaining $1.00 per hour to the
    Association “as each employer’s contribution to the cost of negotiating and
    administering this [Collective] Agreement.”  The money held by the Association
    is called the Industry Fund.  Article 10.02 concludes by providing that if
    the Association determines that it requires more than $0.60 per hour from
    each employer, it shall notify the union of any change in the amount required
    and the employers’ contributions shall be increased accordingly.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    accordance with its constitution and by-laws, the Association established
    a Board of Directors which manages the Association’s affairs and makes all
    relevant decisions with respect to representation of the employers and administration
    of the Collective Agreement, including the amount to be levied for purposes
    of the Industry Fund.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    May 2005, pursuant to s. 96 of the Act, A.C. Concrete filed an unfair labour
    practice complaint against the Association.  In the complaint, A.C. Concrete
    alleged that the Association had agreed with Local 183 to eliminate subcontracting,
    knowing that would have an adverse effect on the appellant and other small
    contractors.  It also alleged that the Association had discriminated in other
    ways against small contractors and that it had arbitrarily increased the
    levy for the Industry Fund and then misused that money.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    February 9, 2006, at the outset of the hearing before the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario Labour Relations Board (the “Board”), A.C. Concrete withdrew the
    complaint, with leave of the Board.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    early March 2006, A.C. Concrete filed a Notice of Arbitration under the <i>Arbitration
    Act, 1991</i>, S.O. 1991, c. 17, and Article 8 of the constitution and by-laws
    of the Association.  The issues raised were similar to those in the unfair
    labour practice complaint with the focus of the Notice being on the alleged
    misuse of the Industry Fund by the Association.   Article 8 mandates that
    any disputes arising out of the affairs of the Association shall be referred
    to arbitration, provided the complainant is a member of the Association or
    has been a non-member for no more than six months.  The parties agreed to
    appoint Mr. Surdykowski as the arbitrator.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    February 22, 2007, the arbitrator issued an award in which he held that because
    A.C. Concrete had resigned from the Association and been a non-member for
    more than six months, it did not have standing to have its claim arbitrated
    under the <i>Arbitration Act, 1991</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A.C.
    Concrete then commenced the present action against the Association and Piccininni,
    whom it alleges was the “controlling mind” of the Association, claiming damages
    for breach of contract, breach of fiduciary duty and intentional interference
    with economic relations.  It also seeks an accounting, by the Association,
    of all revenues and expenses in relation to the Industry Fund since 1997.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    its Statement of Claim, A.C. Concrete alleges that it entered into a contract
    with the Association under the terms of which the Association agreed to use
    the funds paid by A.C. Concrete into the Industry Fund for the equal benefit
    of all employer contractors (the “Contract”).  Instead, it is alleged, the
    Association breached its duties by misusing the Industry Fund.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    para. 9 of the Statement of Claim, the particulars of the breaches are said
    to include:  (i) the Association’s misuse of the Industry Fund in a manner
    that benefits select employers to the detriment of the other employers who
    are also required to pay into the Industry Fund; (ii) the Association’s misuse
    of the Industry Fund in a manner that benefits large employers to the detriment
    of the other employers who are also required to pay into the Industry Fund;
    (iii) the Association’s excessive spending on meetings, salaries, benefits,
    general office expenses and professional fees; (iv) the Association’s arbitrary
    increase of the amount each employer must submit to the Industry Fund; (v)
    the Association’s failure to continue to provide contract referrals to A.C.
    Concrete; and (vi) other actions of the Association that interfere with the
    economic relations of A.C. Concrete. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Association brought a motion to have the action dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    January 17, 2008, the motion judge dismissed A.C. Concrete’s action pursuant
    to rule 21.01(3)(a) of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>.  She held that
    the court lacked jurisdiction because A.C. Concrete’s claims fell within
    the Board’s exclusive jurisdiction.  Having decided the motion based on rule
    21.01(3)(a), the motion judge found that there was no need to make a determination
    under rules 21.01(1)(b) or 21.01(3)(d).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A.C.
    Concrete appeals.  It submits that the motion judge erred in dismissing its
    action for want of jurisdiction.  It argues that the Board’s jurisdiction
    is limited to matters set out in the Act and that the causes of action in
    its claim are not matters which the Act empowers the Board to decide.  Further,
    it maintains that the court has jurisdiction because its claim is based primarily
    on the Contract and not on the Collective Agreement.  Finally, it says that
    not all the relief it seeks is available through the Board.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents cross-appeal and ask that, in the event the appeal is allowed,
    the matter be remitted to the motion judge for determination pursuant to
    rules 21.01(1)(b) and 21.01(3)(d).</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    decide whether the Board has exclusive jurisdiction over the appellant’s
    claims, the essential character of the dispute must be determined.  This
    is not a matter of semantics nor of the legal labels attached to the claims
    by one of the parties to the dispute – it is the true substance of the dispute
    that is determinative:
     see <i>Weber v. Ontario Hydro</i>, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 929, at para. 52, and <i>Myrtezaj
    v. Cintas Canada Ltd</i>. (2008), 90 O.R. (3d) 384 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), at para. 55.  The essential character of the dispute is determined by
    reference to the factual matrix of the dispute:  see <i>Cintas </i>at para.
    55.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that the dispute arises from a breach of a contractual or
    fiduciary relationship that exists between the parties.  I disagree for two
    reasons.  First, in my view, the relationship between A.C. Concrete and the
    Association arises from the Act and the Collective Agreement, and not from
    the Contract.  As a result of an accreditation order made by the Board pursuant
    to its powers under the Act, the Association is the exclusive bargaining
    agent with the Universal Workers Union, LIUNA, Local 183.  It represents
    all employers bound by the Collective Agreement, whether or not the employer
    is a member of the Association.  Thus, the Association represents the appellant
    even though the appellant is no longer a member.  Further, the Association
    funds its activities through the Industry Fund and the Industry Fund is comprised
    of monies paid by employers, including A.C. Concrete, pursuant to Article
    10 in Schedule A to the Collective Agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the factual essence of the appellant’s claim that the Association misused
    the Industry Fund relates not to the Contract but to the manner in which
    the Association has represented employers.  Paragraphs 9(i), (ii), (v) and
    (vi) of the Statement of Claim are essentially claims that the Association
    has preferred the interests of large employers over those of small contractors
    when representing its members.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the motion judge that the substance of those claims is that the
    Association failed to represent the appellant fairly, without discrimination
    and in good faith in its representations.  This matter is clearly within
    the exclusive jurisdiction of the Board.  Section 96(1) of the Act empowers
    the Board to inquire into a complaint of non-compliance by an employer association
    with any section of the Act to determine whether there has been a contravention.<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  Section 114(1) gives the Board exclusive jurisdiction
    to exercise the powers granted to it under the Act, including the powers
    conferred by s. 96,<a href="#_ftn2"
name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a> and s. 141 prohibits the Association from acting
    in a manner that is arbitrary, discriminatory or in bad faith in the representation
    of the appellant.  Section 141 reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>141.    <b>An accredited employers’ organization</b>,
    so long as it continues to be entitled to represent employers in a unit of
    employers, <b>shall not act in a manner that is arbitrary, discriminatory
    or in bad faith in the representation of any of the employers in the unit,
    whether members of the accredited employers’
    organization or not</b>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Parenthetically,
    to the extent that the appellant argues that the duties of the Association
    are owed only to its members, I disagree.  The concluding words of s. 141
    clearly provide that the duties are owed to employers in the bargaining unit,
    including the appellant, regardless of whether they are members of the Association.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    remaining claims of misuse of the Industry Fund in paras. 9(iii) and (iv)
    of the Statement of Claim fall within the purview of s. 143 of the Act.  Section
    143 gives the Board jurisdiction to consider the amounts paid by A.C. Concrete
    pursuant to article 10.02 of Schedule A to the Collective Agreement and to
    determine whether the Association has levied a fee, dues or assessment that
    is unreasonable or discriminatory.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Section 143 reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>143. An accredited employers’ organization shall
    not charge, levy or prescribe initiation fees, dues or assessments that,
    in the opinion of the Board, are unreasonable or discriminatory.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Paragraph
    9(iv) of the Statement of Claim (<i>i.e.</i> the alleged arbitrary increase
    in amounts required to be paid into the Industry Fund) falls within the plain
    meaning of s. 143.  The Board may examine the amounts that A.C. Concrete
    has been required to pay to determine whether they are unreasonable or discriminatory,
    as between large and small contractors.  The allegation in para. (iii)
    – that the Association spent excessive amounts on meetings, salaries and
    the like – can be examined, as well, because if such excesses have taken
    place, presumably the fees have been increased as a result and such increases
    would, therefore, be unreasonable.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I am of the view that the Board has exclusive jurisdiction over the appellant’s
    claims and the motion judge made no error in dismissing the action for want
    of jurisdiction. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    turn next to the appellant’s argument that the court has jurisdiction because,
    in a proceeding before the Board, it would be unable to obtain the relief
    it seeks in the court action.  I reject this submission.  Section 96(4) of
    the Act grants the Board very broad remedial powers.<a href="#_ftn3"
name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[3]</span></span></span></a>  In the event that the Board finds a contravention
    of the Act, the Board is empowered to order the Association to rectify the
    act or acts that are complained of.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor
    do I accept the appellant’s assertion that if the action is dismissed, it
    will have been denied the opportunity to have its grievances in respect of
    the Association properly decided.  The appellant had the opportunity to have
    these matters dealt with by the Board but, by withdrawing its complaint,
    chose to forego that opportunity.  It cannot now complain about the consequence
    of that decision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    I wish to comment on the appellant’s submission in oral argument that even
    if those parts of its pleading which relate to the collection of fees or
    dues are within the Board’s exclusive jurisdiction, the motion judge ought
    to have struck only those parts and allowed the balance of the claim – which
    it says relates to enforcement – to proceed.  As this suggestion was not
    put to the motion judge, it ought not to be raised here on appeal for the
    first time.  Furthermore, the unnecessary bifurcation of proceedings flowing
    out of the same factual matrix is to be avoided – where related issues arise
    from a dispute, they should be heard by a single adjudicative body to the
    extent jurisdictionally possible.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[4]</span></span></span></a>  If courts fail to defer completely to the Board’s
    jurisdiction in circumstances such as these, violence is done to the comprehensive
    statutory scheme designed to govern the relationship between the parties – the
    assumption of jurisdiction, even over a limited part of the claim, would
    fly in the face of the demonstrated legislative intent to provide an exclusive
    and comprehensive mechanism for labour dispute resolution.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>DISPOSITION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I would dismiss the appeal with the result that the cross-appeal falls away.  I
    would order costs of the appeal and cross-appeal to the respondents, fixed
    in the amount of $12,600, inclusive of disbursements and GST.  Costs of the
    motion were awarded to the respondents and, in light of the result on appeal,
    that order remains.  The suggestion was made that this court should set the
    quantum of those costs.  I would decline to do so as, in my view, that matter
    is best decided by the motion judge.  Thus, in accordance with her decision,
    if the parties are unable to resolve the matter of costs of the motion, they
    shall return to the motion judge for a determination of that matter.     </p>
