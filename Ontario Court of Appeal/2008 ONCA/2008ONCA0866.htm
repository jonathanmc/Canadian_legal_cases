    parties have been involved in matrimonial litigation since 2006.  The husband
    appeals the order of Rogers J., dated July 10, 2008, striking his Answer
    to the wife’s claims for support and an equalization payment.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge struck the husband’s Answer because she found he had breached
    an order for disclosure of financial information relating to his business,
    a company in which he and his partner each owned a fifty percent interest.  While
    she also found that the husband’s failure to comply with a preservation order
    cast doubt on his good faith in the litigation, the motion before her did
    not seek relief for breach of that order.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    remedy striking a pleading is a serious one and should only be used in unusual
    cases.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    our view, the motion judge erred in striking the husband’s Answer.  The husband’s
    conduct, upon which she relied, was not sufficiently serious to require the
    striking order.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    December 19, 2007, MacKinnon J. ordered the husband to disclose certain financial
    records and breakdowns of financial information from his business.  The husband
    produced some but not all of the records.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    January 4, 2008, the husband’s business partner instituted the buy sell process
    that was provided for in the partnership agreement.  That process led to
    the husband selling his fifty percent in the business on February 15, 2008.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    husband’s business was his main source of income and his main asset other
    than his interest in the matrimonial home.  The husband accepts that the
    financial records from the company that he was ordered to disclose are relevant
    to the wife’s matrimonial claims.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    the wife may eventually challenge the <i>bona fides</i> of the buy sell process,
    she did not do so on the motion to strike the husband’s Answer and the motion
    judge did not make any finding in that respect.  Thus, we approach the issues
    on this appeal on the premise that the husband’s former partner properly
    exercised his contractual rights under their agreement and that there was
    no improper collusion between the husband and his partner aimed at impairing
    the wife’s claims.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>During
    the buy sell process, the parties communicated about the outstanding disclosure
    issues.  The husband did not inform the wife that the buy sell process was
    underway and that his shares were to be sold.  Nor did the husband take any
    steps within the buy sell process to obtain the financial records that had
    not been produced pursuant to the December 19, 2007 order.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    husband’s explanation for these failures is that he believed, erroneously
    as it turned out, that disclosure had been completed as a result of an exchange
    of information between the two financial experts retained by the parties.  Thus,
    he believed there was no need to inform the wife about the pending sale.  The
    motion judge addressed the husband’s belief and concluded that by February
    6, 2008, at the latest, it was evident to the husband that some disclosure
    continued to be missing.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    our view, given the nature of the litigation and the outstanding disclosure
    order, the husband should have told the wife of the impending sale and made
    efforts to obtain the relevant records before closing.  Candour demanded
    no less.  However, it is far from certain that if the husband had taken these
    steps, disclosure would have resulted.  It seems unlikely that the wife could
    have obtained an order staying the sale absent a finding that the buy sell
    process was an artifice being used to assist the husband in the matrimonial
    litigation.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Further,
    the events subsequent to the closing of the sale suggest that the husband’s
    former partner was unlikely to have delivered the required records even if
    the husband had requested them.  After the sale closed, the husband did ask
    for the documents.  The former partner declined.  The husband and wife then
    obtained a court order directing the former partner to produce the records.  The
    former partner has appealed that order and that appeal will be heard in February
    2009.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    considering the seriousness of the husband’s conduct, we note that there
    is no finding that he deliberately breached the disclosure order.  While
    the husband was not as candid as he should have been about the sale process,
    the period during which he knew there was further disclosure required and
    did not act was relatively short, about nine days.  It is far from certain
    that he could have done anything during that period to resolve the issues.  We
    also note that the wife may obtain the disclosure in any event.  If not,
    there remains the possibility that a court hearing this matter at trial might
    draw an inference adverse to the husband based on the circumstances surrounding
    the failure to disclose.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the facts of this case, there is no reason to believe that an order striking
    the husband’s Answer is necessary to prevent prejudice to the wife; nor will
    it assist the court in addressing the issues that require resolution.  Further,
    the sanction imposed goes beyond that which is necessary to express the court’s
    disapproval of the conduct in issue.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the result, we conclude that the husband’s failure to comply with the disclosure
    order is not sufficiently serious to warrant the severe remedy ordered below.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    wife also complains that the way the husband disposed of the proceeds of
    the sale of his shares breached a preservation order made in August 2006.  The
    wife did not specifically rely upon this breach as a basis for the motion
    striking the husband’s Answer, however, she did make specific references
    to it in her affidavit material.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    her reasons striking the husband’s Answer, the motion judge referred to the
    fact that the husband had used much of the money received from the sale to
    pay debts and legal fees.  On this appeal, the husband accepted that the
    use of the monies in this fashion was a “technical” violation of the preservation
    order.  He goes on to argue, however, that there will not be a net effect
    on the equalization calculation because the monies were used to pay off debts
    that existed before valuation day.  Whatever the case, the motion judge was
    not asked to and did not base her order to strike the husband’s Answer on
    a finding that he had breached the preservation order.  Rather, she said
    that it “casts doubt of the litigation good faith” of the husband.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the result, we are satisfied that the appeal should be allowed.  We are,
    however, concerned that there is a possibility at least that the husband’s
    lack of candour could have made a difference to the way the disclosure has
    evolved.  We are also concerned that the husband’s lack of candour should
    not be rewarded.  As a result, we are of the view that he should be required
    to bear the wife’s costs in the litigation that resulted because of her efforts
    to obtain full disclosure.  We, therefore, allow the appeal, set aside the
    order of the motion judge and substitute an order dismissing the wife’s application
    to strike the husband’s Answer on the following conditions:</p>
  <p style='line-height:100%;
