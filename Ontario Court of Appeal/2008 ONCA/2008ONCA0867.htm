    appellants are a group of related companies. Kanbay Managed Solutions (KMS),
    Kanbay Managed Solutions Canada (KMS Canada), Kanbay and Kanbay
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent served as the president of KMS and KMS Canada until his dismissal
    on January 23, 2006. He has sued the appellants for wrongful dismissal and
    negligent misrepresentation. The latter claim alleges that prior to becoming
    president, representations were made to him by representatives of the appellants
    that he would become an equity owner of KMS if he accepted the offer of employment
    and that those shares would be an asset of significant value to him. He claims
    that the appellants knew then that this was false and that the KMS shares
    would be worthless. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    support of this claim, the respondent seeks a forensic valuation of the stock
    of KMS and Kanbay International. He proposes to rely on this evaluation to
    assist in proving the misrepresentation and the damages that he says flow
    from it. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants’ position is that the respondent’s rights and obligations respecting
    his shareholdings in KMS and the value of those shares must be governed by
    the Shareholders’ Agreement he signed, effective March 26, 2003, after he
    commenced his employment. The appellants rely on that agreement and on the <i>International
    Commercial Arbitration Act</i>¸ R.S.O. 1990, C.I.9 (the <i>ICAA</i>) to argue
    that the evaluation sought by the respondent must be done by arbitration
    under the Shareholders’ Agreement. They say that the court must refer this
    issue to arbitration and stay that aspect of the respondent’s action. The
    appellants also argue that the Shareholders’ Agreement contains a waiver
    by the respondent of these claims, and that this issue must also be arbitrated
    under the Shareholders’ Agreement, thus also necessitating a stay of the
    respondent’s action. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    seeking to stay parts of the respondent’s action, the appellants point to
    the UN Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration which is a schedule
    to the <i>ICAA</i>. Article 8(1) of the Model Law says this:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>8(1) A court before which an action is brought
    in a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement shall, if a
    party so requests not later than when submitting his first statement on the
    substance of the dispute, refer the parties to arbitration unless it finds
    that the agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed.         </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    8 of the <i>ICAA</i> says the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>8. Where, pursuant to article 8 of the Model Law,
    a court refers the parties to arbitration, the proceedings of the court are
    stayed with respect to the matters to which the arbitration relates. R.S.O.
    1990, c. I.9, s. 8.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the appellants concede that if they are wrong in relying on the Shareholders’ Agreement
    and the <i>ICAA</i>,<i> </i>they cannot contest Chapnik J.’s decision, pursuant
    to her discretion under the <i>Arbitrations Act, 1991</i>, S.O. 1991, Chap.
    17, not to refer these issues to arbitration, but to allow the respondent’s
    actions to proceed in its entirety. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view there are two reasons to reject the appellants’ position, each of
    which is fatal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first reason is that the issues in question here to do not relate to an international <u>commercial</u> arbitration
    as that term is used in the <i>ICAA </i>and the UN Model Law. These issues
    therefore do not meet the threshold necessary to engage the <i>ICAA</i> and
    the Model Law. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    2 of the <i>ICAA </i>and Article 1 of the Model Law make the Act and the
    Model Law applicable only to international <u>commercial</u><i> </i>arbitration
    (my emphasis).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
    then is the scope of the term “commercial”? Section 13 of the <i>ICAA </i>expressly
    provides that, for the purpose of interpreting the Model Law, resort may
    be had to the Report of the United Nations Commission on International Trade
    Law to its Eighteenth Session (June 3 -21, 1985). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Article
    Eighteen of Part II of the Commentary in that Report reads in part as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            18. The content of the footnote reflects
    the legislative intent to construe the terms commercial in a wide manner.
    This call for a wide interpretation is supported by an illustrative list
    of commercial relationships. Although the examples listed include almost
    all types of contexts known to have given rise to disputes dealt with in
    international commercial arbitrations, the list is expressly not exhaustive.
    Therefore, also covered as commercial would be transactions such as supply
    of electric energy, transport of liquefied gas via pipeline and even “non-transactions” such
    as claims for damages arising in a commercial context. Not covered are, for
    example, labour or employment disputes and ordinary consumer claims, despite
    their relation to business.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    issues at stake here do not arise from a transaction like the supply of electric
    energy, or the transportation of liquefied gas via pipeline. They arise from
    a wrongful dismissal dispute and a tort action for negligent misrepresentation.
    The question of the value of the respondent’s share entitlement arises only
    in the course of determining whether he received a negligent misrepresentation
    about that value. The question of waiver arises only in the context of that
    tort claim and the respondent’s wrongful dismissal dispute. Neither question
    arises in a dispute over a commercial transaction. In the context of this
    case, the term “commercial” does not apply and the issues cannot be said
    to require a “commercial” arbitration for their resolution. For that reason
    the <i>ICAA </i>and the Model Law are not engaged.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second reason to reject the appellants’ position is that the issues at stake
    here do not come within the scope of the arbitration provision in the Shareholders’ Agreement.
    Hence there cannot be an arbitration about them. Thus there can obviously
    be no international commercial arbitration about them, and the <i>ICAA</i> and
    the Model Law are not engaged. The appellants cannot satisfy the “arbitration”
    requirement, just as they cannot satisfy the “commercial” requirement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Article
    8.10 of the Shareholders’ Agreement begins as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            If the parties are unable to resolve
    any disagreement, dispute, controversy or claim that may arise out of the
    transactions contemplated by this Agreement, they shall resolve the disagreement
    or dispute as follows:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus
    only claims arising out of transactions contemplated by the Shareholders
    Agreement are to be arbitrated under it. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“Transaction” is
    defined in Article 3.1(b) of that agreement in these terms:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The term “Transaction” shall mean a single transaction
    or a series of  related transactions constituting (i) a sale or lease of
    all or substantially all of the assets of the Corporation; (ii) a merger
    or consolidation with the Corporation or to which the Corporation is a party;
    (iii) a share exchange in which stock of the Corporation will be acquired
    by another corporation or the Stock of the Corporation will be issued to
    stockholders of another corporation; (iv) the purchase of all or substantially
    all of the assets or shares of capital stock of any Person except in the
    ordinary course of the Corporation’s Business; or (v) the creation or acquisition
    of a subsidiary other than Kanbay Managed Solutions Canada Inc. (the “Canada
    Subsidiary Entity”).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Article
    8(1) of the Model Law requires the court, when the matter is the subject
    of an international commercial arbitration agreement, to refer it to arbitration
    (unless it finds one of the defined exceptions apply none of which need to
    be considered here). In the context of this case, Article 8(1) of the Model
    Law requires the court to determine whether the issues at stake come within
    Article 8.10 of the Shareholders’ Agreement. While the case law suggests
    that any final determination as to the scope of the arbitration agreement
    is better left to the arbitration tribunal (since the question of jurisdiction
    is itself within the jurisdiction of that tribunal), where it is clear that
    the matter does not fall within the arbitration agreement, the court should
    make that finding and decline to make the referral to arbitration. See <i>Dalimpex
    Ltd. v. Janicki </i> (2004), 228 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 179 at paras. 21
    and 22.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    is the case here. The matters raised by the appellants – the value of the
    respondent’s shares and whether he has waived his rights – arise out of the
    respondent’s claims for wrongful dismissal and negligent misrepresentation.
    Neither of these matters arise out of a transaction contemplated by the Shareholders’ Agreement.
    These matters clearly fall outside the arbitration provision in that agreement.
    They could not properly be referred to arbitration pursuant to the <i>ICAA</i> and
    the Model Law. The respondent’s action should proceed in its entirety.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    both these reasons the appeal must be dismissed. Costs to the respondent
    in the amount $19,500 inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>
