      sentencing judge concluded that it was not necessary to include a period
      of probation in the sentences imposed.  The respondent was a first offender,
      a mature adult whose conduct was an isolated incident in an otherwise unblemished
      life. He was unlikely to recidivate and had voluntarily undertaken individual
      and group therapy while on judicial interim release. The coercive terms
      of a probation order were unnecessary to ensure that he continued with

      sentencing judge considered the purpose of <i>SOIRA</i> registration to
      further public safety by permitting police to keep tabs on sex offenders
      living or working in the community.  The model for the registration scheme
      is the predatory stranger offender who hunts victims near his home or
      place of work.  The respondent didnt fit the model for whom registration
      was designed.</span></p>

      revealed actual physical and mental deterioration as a result of the charges
      and characterized the risk of recidivism as low. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      sentencing judge concluded his reasons for refusing to order registration
      in these words, at paras. 40-41:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>            Accordingly, the very
      rationale for collecting and maintaining the information in the Sex Offender
      Information Registry is absent in this case.  As was noted both in <i>Have </i>and
      in <i>Cook</i>, a registry system that is overly inclusive in its reach
      is counter-productive to the very objectives of the system as it will only
      serve to obscure, in investigatory terms, those persons who pose a real
      risk.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            In these particular circumstances,
    I am satisfied that the impact on Mr. Debidin, in terms of his liberty and
    his privacy, from making such an order greatly exceeds any small and theoretical
    benefit to society from maintaining the required information, especially
    given the very significant length of time during which the order would be
    operative.  It seems to me that where, as here, the order will negatively
    impact the offender but will not achieve any real benefit in furtherance
    of the fundamental purpose of the legislation, the consequences of the order
    become grossly disproportionate.  I therefore decline to make the order requested.</p>

      length of the terms of imprisonment imposed or by an order that the sentences
      be served consecutively to one another, rather than concurrently as the
      sentencing judge had ordered.  Further, Ms. Nakelsky abandoned the earlier
      claim that the term of imprisonment should be followed by a lengthy period
      of probation.  And so it is that the only issue ripe for decision is the
      correctness or otherwise of the failure of the sentencing judge to direct

      sentencing judge recognized that a <i>SOIRA</i> order was mandatory unless
      the respondent demonstrated that the exception of s. 490.012(4) applied.
      Contrary to the submissions of the prosecutor, however, the sentencing
      judge concluded that the impact of <i>SOIRA</i> registration on the respondent
      was grossly disproportionate to the public interest described in s. 490.012(4),
      thus he declined to order registration.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      sentencing judge considered that the model for <i>SOIRA </i>registration
      and the rationale underlying the act was the predatory stranger who hunts
      victims in the vicinity of his residence or workplace.  The respondent,
      the trial judge reasoned, thus fell outside the paradigm for whom registration
      was intended.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      sentencing judge concluded that the impact of registration on the respondent
      would be significant.  Registration would preclude any sense of finality
      and delay the respondents emotional recovery. To the contrary, registration
      would continue and exacerbate a psychological stress engendered by the
      proceedings themselves.  Registration would also have a significant impact
      on the respondents liberty interest. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      addition to the impact that registration would have on anyone convicted
      of a designated offence, the sentencing judge identified several factors
      unique to the respondent as enhancing the impact of registration on him.  These
      factors were mentioned in materials filed in support of an application
      to stay proceedings for unreasonable delay.  The materials included an
      affidavit from the respondent and the report of Dr. Julian Gojer, a forensic
      psychiatrist.  The affidavit recites the physical and mental deterioration
      of the respondent as a result of the then outstanding charges and the delay
      in the commencement of trial proceedings.  The report of Dr. Gojer confirms
      the unlikelihood of recidivism and describes the respondent as no risk
      to any child and no threat to society.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      my view, the sentencing judges conclusion that the impact of <i>SOIRA </i>registration
      on the respondent was grossly disproportionate to the public interest is
      flawed in several respects.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>To
      begin, while it may be fair to say that one of the underlying rationales
      for the enactment of the <i>SOIRA </i>was to facilitate investigation of
      sexual offences by keeping track of sexual predators, s. 490.012(1), which
      creates a rebuttable presumption that a <i>SOIRA </i>order will follow
      conviction of a designated offence on the application of the prosecutor,
      is not restricted, in its terms or by necessary implication, to the sexual
      predator paradigm.  The subsection, as well it might, does not distinguish
      between the predatory stranger and the opportunistic friend, relative or
      custodian.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second,
      what must be balanced against the specified public interest is the impact
      of <i>SOIRA</i> registration on the convicted offender, not the impact
      of the charge, any delay in awaiting trial, the conviction and its consequences,
      or the characterization of the respondent and others in similar circumstances
      as convicted sex offenders: <i>Dyck</i> at para. 81.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third,
      without the benefit of this courts decision in <i>Dyck</i>, the sentencing
      judge overstated the impact of <i>SOIRA </i>registration on the respondents
      privacy interest. The court in <i>Dyck</i> was concerned with the impact
      of similar reporting requirements under <i>Christophers Law</i>, where
      registration is mandatory.  The court considered the impact on an offenders
      privacy to be minimal in connection with the nature of the information
      required and its closely circumscribed dissemination:  <i>Dyck</i> at paras.
      106-109, 119.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Further,
      the application of the presumptive provisions of s. 490.012(1) and the
      availability of the exception in s. 490.012(4) do not turn on whether a
      convicted offender may re-offend in a way in which the information collected
      under the <i>SOIRA</i> may prove useful to investigators: <i>Dyck</i> at
      para. 123; <i>L. (R.) </i>at paras. 5-7.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      sentencing judge relied upon the report of Dr. Gojer and the affidavit
      of the respondent in his assessment of the impact of <i>SOIRA </i>registration
      on the respondent.  While these documents were made part of the record
      at the sentencing hearing, their focus was not on the impact of <i>SOIRA</i> registration.  Neither
      mentions <i>SOIRA</i> registration.  Each explains the impact that the
      sexual offence charges and allegedly unreasonable amount of time spent
      awaiting trial had had on his physical and mental health, as well as on
      his ability to pursue his chosen career.  But prejudice that arises from
      the fact and nature of criminal charges, as well as the stigma associated
      with later becoming a convicted sex offender, have nothing to say about
      the impact of a <i>SOIRA </i>order: <i>Dyck</i> at para. 81.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      reporting requirements of the <i>SOIRA</i>, like those under <i>Christophers
      Law, </i>admittedly infringe, to some extent at least, the liberty interests
      of the respondent and others in similar circumstances.  Yet the restrictions
      are modest and do not prohibit the respondent from going anywhere, or doing
      anything: <i>Dyck</i> at paras. 104, 106-108.  The registration and reporting
      requirements of the <i>SOIRA</i> are at once limited in scope and in the
      time required to complete them.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Another
      influential factor in the sentencing judges decision to refuse to order <i>SOIRA </i>registration
      was the duration of the order: 20 years.  But under s. 490.015(1)(b), the
      respondent can apply after ten years for a termination order.  Adverse
      decisions may be appealed under s. 490.017.  Further applications are permitted,
      governed by s. 490.015(4).  </span></p>

      Ms. </span>Nakelsky <span lang=EN-US>for the appellant made it clear that
      she was not seeking to have the respondent re-incarcerated after he had
      served the custodial component of the sentence imposed by the trial judge,
      I have not considered whether the quantum of the sentences imposed, as
      well as the manner in which they should be served (concurrently rather
      than consecutively) reflects error. At all events, I do not wish to be
      taken as holding that either decision is free of error.</span></p>

      first has to do with commencement of custodial sentences and comes up in
      this way. On August 23, 2007, the trial judge imposed sentences of imprisonment
      for six months on each count and ordered that the sentences be served concurrently
      with each other.  A<i>fter </i>these sentences had been imposed, counsel
      for the respondent entreated the trial judge to permit the respondent to
      surrender into custody to begin service of the sentence after the long
      [Labour Day] weekend.  The prosecutor offered no opposition to the request.  The
      sentencing judge acceded to the proposal. The respondent was directed to
      return to court on September 4, 2007, to surrender into custody to begin
      service of the sentence.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>When
      the respondent appeared on September 4, 2007, his counsel, again for the
      first time, asked the sentencing judge whether the sentences imposed on
      August 23, 2007, had included credit for the one month that the respondent
      had spent in pre-disposition custody. The sentencing judge indicated that
      the sentences he had imposed did not include credit for pre-disposition
      custody. In the result, the sentencing judge altered the sentence on
      each count to four months imprisonment and directed that the sentences
      be served concurrently with each other.</span></p>

      this case, at the very least, a custodial sentence was a realistic likelihood.  If
      there were some legitimate basis, beyond mere preference or personal convenience,
      why the respondent could not begin to serve the custodial sentence on the
      day on which it was imposed, counsel for the respondent should have drawn
      this to the attention of the prosecutor and the sentencing judge <i>before</i>,
      not after sentence was imposed. The sentencing judge would then have been
      in a position to determine the date upon which he would impose sentence.</span></p>
