      the sale of drugs.  Radojcic indicated that he had no problem taking the

    who could help Cox in his activities. Cox claimed that he had been in the

      January 10, 2003, Paul Cox delivered two months rent to George Radojcic

    <st1:place

      that his business was getting bigger and he wanted to accelerate his money

      availability.  After another query by Cox on April 15, 2003, a meeting

      into something else to carry out Cox’s scheme.  Root offered several alternatives
      including creation of an investment company that could buy, then sell property,
      submission of invoices for consulting fees, or corporate loans. Root could
      get another lawyer, who would not know of the origin of the funds, to do

      with large amounts of cash, $100,000 or $200,000, for a fee.  He could
      manage $200,000 weekly but needed to think about the mechanics of it.  Radojcic

      rate for money laundering transactions, but would factor in compensation
      to Radojcic as part of the fee.  Cox indicated that 4% to 6% was a usual
      rate depending on the nature of the transaction. The respondent later suggested
      that a fee of $60,000 on a transaction involving $1,000,000 would be satisfactory.</span></p>

      satisfied that Radojcic knew what Cox wanted to do and that Cox was looking
      for help to launder proceeds of crime.  Radojcic introduced Cox to Root
      to help out Cox in his scheme.  Cox left Root in charge of any payment
      to Radojcic for his services.  Radojcic’s introduction of Root to Cox was
      not evidence that Radojcic was a member of any conspiracy, despite Radojcic’s

      participate in the movement of illicit funds and suggested several methods
      by which this purpose could be achieved. Prior to May 25, 2003, however,
      the respondent was acting on his own and had not reached an agreement with

      brief passages in the trial judge’s reasons reflect her findings about
      the adequacy of the prosecution’s proof that the respondent conspired with
      unknown others to launder the proceeds of crime or to possess property
      or its proceeds of criminal origins:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is clear that Mr. Root indicated that he had
    spoken to others about moving funds to the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>
    in the millions of dollars.  It is also clear that his contacts were concerned
    about an exposure to risk and about the amount of the fee.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The essential question is whether the existence
    of a conspiracy is the only reasonable inference to be drawn from all of
    the evidence concerning Mr. Root’s discussions with another or other persons
    as he relayed them to Sergeant Nicholson.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Crown submits that Mr. Root consulted with
    unknown associates with whom he formed a common intention to launder funds.  While
    I agree that Mr. Root had probably formed such an intention, I find that
    I am not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that he had actually entered
    into such an agreement with them to this effect.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In the context of all of the evidence before me,
    I find that I am unable to reach the conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt
    that the other person or persons entered into an agreement with Mr. Root
    to do an unlawful act.  If I am not so satisfied, I cannot find that Mr.
    Root conspired with him or with them to launder the proceeds of crime.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I am entirely satisfied that Mr. Root <u>attempted</u> to
    commit a conspiracy with Sergeant Nicholson, but for the reasons given by
    the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. Déry</i> and the reasons just given,
    Mr. Root is therefore found not guilty of counts one and two on the indictment.  (Emphasis

      trial judge held that the prosecution was required to prove that the respondent

      risk that the offence counselled was in fact likely to be committed as

      trial judge rejected the prosecution’s claim that the respondent actively
      induced or advocated the laundering of drug proceeds and intended that
      the offence be committed.  The nucleus of her reasons is what follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is clear that it is the undercover officer who
    approached Mr. Root and who solicited his advice and participation. It is
    also clear throughout the course of their considerations with respect to
    methodology and their negotiations with respect to price, <b>both</b> parties
    were allegedly in consultation with others who were also decision makers
    in the process.  In the circumstances of the case, Mr. Root might have wished
    to, but knew he could not, procure, induce or incite Mr. Cox to commit the
    offence because Mr. Cox was allegedly accountable to others.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I find that Mr. Root talked a lot about how money
    could be moved depending upon a host of factors. I also find, however, that
    his words, ideas, plans and attitude were not intended to incite, procure
    or solicit Sergeant Nicholson. They were simply a detailed response to a
    request by the officer to find a method to move funds.</p>

      respondent, Radojcic, and unknown persons to possess and launder the proceeds
      of trafficking in cocaine. The prosecutor need only to have proven and
      did prove an unlawful agreement between the respondent and Radojcic or

      appellant contends that the evidence established the required agreement
      between the respondent and Radojcic. Cox told Radojcic that he (Cox) had
      funds, the proceeds of drug trafficking, that he wanted to launder. He
      even asked about using Radojcic’s trust account for his purposes. Radojcic
      suggested the purchase of several properties owned by his (Radojcic’s)
      mother as a means of cleaning funds.  Aware of the scheme, Radojcic set
      up a meeting with the respondent, a person he represented as one who could
      accomplish what Cox required.  It is irresistible that Radojcic agreed
      to obtain the proceeds from Cox and to launder them as Cox sought. Radojcic’s
      role in the conspiracy was to put the respondent in contact with Cox, thus
      to ensure, through the respondent’s expertise, the desired execution of
      the scheme. That Radojcic would not participate himself in the actual possession
      or laundering of the funds is of no moment since the essence of conspiracy
      is the agreements to possess and to launder.</span></p>

      adduced at trial. Radojcic was never part of any negotiations.  Providing

    unknown to gain possession of what he believed to be proceeds of drug trafficking

      the small matter of illegality), Cox’s failure to agree to the fee represented

      of crime – trafficking in cocaine.  The respondent met Cox on several occasions
      and offered several means for Cox to achieve his purpose.  Property investments.
      Consulting fees.  Corporate loans. The respondent consulted with others
      and set out the terms under which the laundering of funds would be done.  Discussion

      reasoned, the <i>mens rea</i> for both attempts was lacking.  An attempt
      is not a conspiracy.  What is relevant and dispositive is the state of
