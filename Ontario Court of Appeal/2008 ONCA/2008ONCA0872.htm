style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant, a Canadian pig producer, agreed to sell 8,505 pigs to the respondent
    corporation, a Russian agro-industrial company.  A dispute arose as to the
    health of the pigs.  The respondent corporation invoked the arbitration clause
    in the contract of purchase and sale which provided for an arbitration to
    proceed in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Moscow.  The appellant refused to participate in the arbitration on the ground
    that the chief executive officer of the Russian company had threatened to
    kill the appellant’s chief operating officer who, as a result, was unwilling
    to travel to
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Moscow
    – as were the appellant’s witnesses.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant commenced an action in
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    Ontario against the respondents and sought an anti-suit injunction against
    the respondent company to stop the arbitration from proceeding in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Moscow.  The respondents sought an order staying the action.  The motion
    judge dismissed the motion for an anti-suit injunction and granted a stay
    of the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario action.</p>

    appellant appeals both orders of the motion judge.  I would dismiss the appeal
    for the reasons which follow.</p>

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant, Donaldson International Livestock Ltd. (“Donaldson”), is a leading
    Canadian exporter of purebred pigs.  It has exported pigs to more than 45
    countries around the world.  James Donaldson is the major shareholder and
    chief operating officer of Donaldson.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent, Znamensky Selekcionno-Gibridny Center LLC (“Znamensky”), is a
    Russian corporation which was created in 2006 to produce purebred animals.  The
    respondent, Nikolay Demin, is the chief executive officer of Znamensky.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    August 2006, Znamensky agreed to purchase from Donaldson 8,505 purebred pigs
    for U.S. $7,338,496.  The contract provided that the pigs should be tested
    and quarantined prior to export to Russia pursuant to the requirements of
    the Canadian Food Inspection Agency (“CFIA”) and pursuant to an international
    agreement between Russia and Canada.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    contract contained an arbitration clause as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>12.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Arbitration</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Any dispute, controversy or claim, which may arise
    out of or in connection with the present contract (agreement), or the execution,
    breach, termination or invalidity thereof, shall be settled by the

    pigs were placed into pre-export quarantine in three lots and were inspected
    by veterinarians from CFIA and private veterinarians who were retained by
    Donaldson.  The veterinarians were satisfied that the pigs in Quarantine
    No. 1 were fit for export.  However, in accordance with the provisions of
    the contract, a veterinarian from
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Russia</st1:country-region>
    , Dr. Pisarev, inspected the quarantined pigs and concluded that the pigs
    in Quarantine No. 1 were not healthy.  Dr. Hambleton, another veterinarian
    from the CFIA, who had not inspected the pigs, gave an opinion that there
    was a risk the pigs in Quarantine No. 1 would not be approved for export.  A
    further opinion was obtained from a swine specialist at the CFIA who concluded
    that the pigs were suitable for export. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    November 17, 2006 at about 5:00 a.m., Mr. Donaldson was awakened by a telephone
    call from Mr. Demin in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Russia</st1:country-region>
    .  Mr. Demin spoke in Russian and his colleague, Andrey Bodin, was on the
    line and acted as the interpreter for the call.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    heated discussion followed.  Mr. Demin had apparently just seen a report
    from Dr. Pisarev and Dr. Hambleton concerning the health of the pigs in Quarantine
    No. 1 and demanded that Donaldson provide new pigs to satisfy the terms of
    the contract.  Mr. Donaldson refused.  The conversation became increasingly
    hostile and, according to Mr. Donaldson, Mr. Demin shouted, “what happens
    to people that cross me,” followed by “I will kill you” – uttered twice.  The
    call ended with these threats.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the next few months, efforts were made to resolve the dispute through correspondence
    in which Mr. Demin denied that he had made the alleged threats.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Znamensky
    continued to refuse to accept the delivery of the pigs from Quarantine No.
    1, although it took delivery of 291 pigs from Quarantine No. 2 and Quarantine
    No. 3.  Znamensky demanded that Donaldson return its advanced payment of
    U.S. $1,666,113.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    March 17, 2007, a meeting took place in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Ottawa between Mr. Donaldson, Mr. Demin and others in a futile attempt to
    resolve the dispute.  During the course of this meeting, Mr. Demin made certain
    comments that Mr. Donaldson took as a further threat.  He subsequently reported
    the alleged threats to the police.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On

    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    International Commercial Arbitration Court (“ICAC”) pursuant to the arbitration
    clause in the contract.  On August 15, 2007, Donaldson commenced this action
    in the Superior Court in which it claimed <i>inter alia</i>:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>a

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>interim,
    interlocutory and permanent injunctions prohibiting Znamensky from seeking

  <h2>THE INJUNCTION PROCEEDINGS     </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>By
    notice of motion dated August 16, 2007, Donaldson moved for an interim and
    interlocutory injunction prohibiting Znamensky from proceeding with the arbitration
    before the ICAC in
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Moscow.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    basis for the injunction was that the individuals who were involved with
    the quarantine and inspection of the pigs in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    were aware of the death threats made against Mr. Donaldson and refused to
    appear as witnesses in
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Moscow for the arbitration, which rendered the proceeding unfair to Donaldson.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Prior
    to the injunction motion proceeding to court, Znamensky advised Donaldson
    that it was prepared to consent to Mr. Donaldson and his witnesses testifying
    by telephone, video conference or other means to avoid their having to travel
    to Moscow.  Alternatively,  Znamensky was prepared to agree to a mutually
    acceptable location outside of
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Russia</st1:country-region>
    for the holding of the arbitration.  These suggestions were made on the basis
    that Donaldson would pay for any increased costs.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Donaldson
    declined the proposal to pursue alternative means of proceeding with the
    arbitration.  Znamensky brought a cross-motion for a stay of the action.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge began his analysis by referring to article 8 of the <i>International
    Commercial Arbitration Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, Chapter I.9 which provides:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A court before which an action is brought in a matter
    which is the subject of an arbitration agreement shall, if a party so requests
    not later than when submitting his first statement on the substance of the
    dispute refer the parties to arbitration unless it finds that the agreement
    is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed.<u></u></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge then considered the evidence of the alleged threats to kill
    Mr. Donaldson and, applying the “strong cause”
    test, articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Z. I. Pompey Industrie
    v. ECU-Line N.V.</i>, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 450 at para. 20, he concluded:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I have considered the Plaintiff’s evidence of threats
    in and of itself and in light of the evidence proffered by the defendants
    by way of traversal.  I am not persuaded that the Plaintiff has established
    the background of threats, even on a balance of probabilities.  More importantly,
    I am of the view that this issue can hardly be resolved summarily, but, must
    proceed to be determined after a <i>viva voce</i> hearing, if it even becomes
    relevant in the Arbitration proceedings for reasons, at this moment in time,
    which are beyond my contemplation.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>That said, I am not persuaded that a strong cause
    has been made out on the facts as contained in the material now provided
    to me.  Nor has the Plaintiff satisfied me that the test described in Article
    8, just described [<i>sic</i>] of the International Commercial Arbitration
    Act has been satisfied and that the subject agreement is either inoperative
    or incapable of being performed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge expressed the view that, if he erred in his conclusion that
    the “strong cause” test had not been satisfied, the proposal of Znamensky
    to conduct part of the proceeding electronically or to move the arbitration
    out of Russia altogether had the effect of eliminating or minimizing the
    alleged threats and thereby undercutting the basis upon which the injunction
    was sought. </p>

    Moscow on January 17, 2008 and April 17, 2008.  Donaldson did not participate.  On
    March 6, 2008, the ICAC panel awarded Znamensky judgment in the amount of
    U.S. $1,234,416.65 in damages and U.S. $26,205.28 as compensation for the
    arbitration fee.  On May 13, 2008, the ICAC panel awarded Znamensky a second
    judgment against Donaldson for U.S. $424,732.94 in damages and U.S. $9,006.21

  <h2>THE APPEAL FROM THE MOTION JUDGE</h2>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    view of the fact that the arbitration has already been held, and the arbitration
    panel has issued two separate awards, it seems to me that the appeal from
    the order dismissing the motion for an injunction prohibiting Znamensky from
    proceeding with the arbitration is moot.  Issues (i), (ii) and (iv) relate
    to the dismissal of the anti-suit injunction.  Donaldson appears to accept
    that its appeal from the order dismissing the anti-suit injunction is moot
    by reason of the relief it now seeks on this appeal.  Donaldson no longer
    seeks an injunction restraining Znamensky from proceeding with the arbitration.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The

    by the ICAC as against Donaldson; and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the

style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, the time to have requested the trial of the issue concerning the
    death threats was when the parties were before the motion judge.  The case
    was argued on the basis of a paper record and the motion judge found that
    it fell short of establishing that the threats against Mr. Donaldson were
    made.  The motion judge’s reference to a <i>viva voce</i> hearing related
    to the arbitration hearing, which Donaldson chose not to attend.  It was
    not up to the trial judge to order that <i>viva voce</i> evidence be tendered
    before him in the absence of a request from counsel.  It is the counsel who
    presents the case, not the trial judge.</p>

    my view, it is not appropriate for this court to deal with the request to
    prohibit the enforcement of the arbitration award.  Although the request
    is included in the statement of claim, this was not a claim made before the
    motion judge, and he made no order in respect of it.</p>

    resist the enforcement of those awards on whatever basis it chooses, subject
    to the ruling of the presiding judge.  In my view, the issue of enforcement
    must, at this stage, be dealt with at first instance and not in this court.  </p>

    for Donaldson submits that the motion judge erred in granting a stay of the
    action because the statement of claim requests relief that is beyond the
    scope of the arbitration clause in the contract of purchase and sale.  In
    particular, he alleges that the following claims are beyond the jurisdiction
    of an arbitration panel established under the arbitration clause: (i) a declaration
    that an arbitral award should not be recognized or enforced in
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario due to the misconduct of the respondent; and (ii) damages for the
    tort of intimidation.  Although counsel, in his factum, did not include the
    additional claim for the tort of intentional interference with economic relations
    and injurious falsehood by causing Donaldson to be “blacklisted” in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region

    [2006] S.C.C.A. No. 412 is instructive on the issue of whether a contractual
    arbitration clause can apply to related tort claims.  Speaking for the court,
    Labrosse J.A. said at para. 34: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Although only two of the five claims against NIOC
    are for breach of the contract containing the selection clause, the three
    remaining claims arising from the seized rigs and the refusal to permit exportation
    of the assets are so intertwined with the contract so as to justify that
    they be heard together in the same forum.</p>

    of the approach to arbitration clauses, I am satisfied that this clause is
    broad enough to include virtually all of the claims advanced in the statement
    of claim.  The fact that one of the claims is against a non-party to the
    agreement, Mr. Demin, is not sufficient to oust the ICAC and Moscow from
    hearing these matters when the entire focus of the action relates to issues
    arising out of the contractual relations of the principal parties.</p>
