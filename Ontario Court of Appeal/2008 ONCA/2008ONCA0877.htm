    litigants are compelled in the discovery process to disclose information
    to their opponents.  Forced disclosure can compromise a litigant’s legitimate
    interest in maintaining the confidentiality of documents and information.  However,
    interference with that privacy interest is justified as essential to a fair
    and accurate resolution of the litigation.  Various judicial and legislative
    means have been developed to limit the interference with privacy interests
    to the confines of the litigation in which the disclosure is compelled.  In
    Ontario, the deemed undertaking, created by Rule 30.1 of the <i>Rules of
    Civil Procedure</i>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194, protects privacy interests by
    controlling the use of information outside of the litigation in which it
    was obtained by way of compelled disclosure.  This appeal examines the application
    of the deemed undertaking rule where a plaintiff, who obtained information
    from a defendant in one action, seeks to withhold that information from another
    defendant in the discovery process in a second action also commenced by the
    plaintiff.  </p>

    Kitchenham, the respondent (“plaintiff”), was in a car accident in January
    1993.  She sued the other driver in January 1995 (the “tort action”).  The
    tort defendant obtained an order under s. 105 of the <i>Courts of Justice
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, requiring the plaintiff to submit to an independent
    medical examination.  That medical examination was performed by Dr. Clifford,
    a psychiatrist.  A copy of his report (the “IME”), dated January 1999, was
    provided to the plaintiff by the tort defendant as required under rule 33.06.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    tort defendant conducted surveillance of the plaintiff.  During the discovery
    process, the tort defendant provided a copy of the surveillance videotape
    to the plaintiff, pursuant to Rule 30.<a href="#_ftn1"

    tort action settled some time in the year 2000.  About four years earlier,
    the plaintiff had commenced a second action (the “benefits action”).  In
    the benefits action, the plaintiff sued her own insurer, AXA Insurance Canada
    (“AXA”), claiming that she was disabled and unable to work, and that AXA
    had improperly withheld weekly income replacement benefits and payments for
    certain rehabilitation-related expenses.  AXA filed a statement of defence
    in 1997.  </p>

    in the benefits action were completed in 2003.  During those discoveries,

    plaintiff refused to produce the videotape and the IME claiming that she
    was bound by the deemed undertaking in Rule 30.1.  She refused to produce
    the documents relating to the settlement claiming that they were irrelevant
    to any issue in the benefits action.  AXA brought a motion challenging the
    refusals.  </p>

    motion judge held that the video surveillance and the IME engaged the deemed
    undertaking rule, whether or not the plaintiff was the recipient of the discovery
    documents.  However, he concluded that the Rule precluded use and not disclosure.  He
    ordered production of the videotape and the IME, limiting their use to potential
    impeachment purposes.  He agreed with the plaintiff’s contention that the
    settlement documents were irrelevant:  see <i>Kitchenham v. Axa Insurance</i> (2005),
    17 C.P.C. (6th) 375 (

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, the Rule exists to protect the privacy interest of the party compelled
    by the rules of disclosure to provide that information to another party to
    the litigation.  The Rule provides that protection by prohibiting the party
    who obtained the information through compelled disclosure from using that
    information outside of the litigation, except where certain exceptions apply
    or the court makes an order permitting its use. </p>

    plaintiff obtained copies of the videotape and the IME from the tort defendant
    in the course of the discovery process in the tort action.  Consequently,
    that material falls within the scope of the deemed undertaking found in Rule
    30.1.  AXA can obtain a copy of the videotape and the IME by obtaining either
    the consent of the tort defendant, or an order of the court pursuant to rule
    30.1.01(8).</p>

    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    Divisional Court and the motion judge that AXA has not demonstrated that
    the settlement documents have any relevance to the benefits action brought
    by the plaintiff against AXA.  I would not order those documents produced
    and will briefly address that issue before turning to an analysis of the
    deemed undertaking rule.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>AXA
    argues that it is entitled to production of the settlement documents in the
    tort action because the amount and terms of the settlement could provide
    a disincentive to the plaintiff to work, thereby colouring her claim in the
    benefits action that she is actually disabled and unable to work.  No other
    relevance is suggested.  The amount of the settlement in the tort action
    can have no impact on what AXA must pay under its policy if the plaintiff’s
    claim succeeds.</p>

    agree with the motion judge (paras. 51-53) and the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    Divisional Court (para. 22) that this ground of appeal cannot succeed.  The
    issue in the benefits action is whether the plaintiff is disabled and unable
    to work.  The impact, if any, of the settlement in the tort action on the
    plaintiff’s motivation to work and, more particularly, the connection between
    that motivation and the extent to which the plaintiff is actually disabled
    are both so speculative as to be beyond even the generous notion of relevance
    applied at this stage of a proceeding:  <i>Kay v. Posluns</i> (1989), 71
    O.R. (2d) 238 (H.C.), at p. 246.</p>

    copy of the videotape and the IME are relevant in the benefits action.  Both
    potentially speak to the level of the plaintiff’s disability.  They are in
    the possession of the plaintiff.  Apart from Rule 30.1, no basis has been
    advanced by the plaintiff for withholding this material from AXA during the
    discovery process.  The plaintiff did not advance a privilege claim, although
    some of the plaintiff’s submissions suggested that the personal nature of
    the information conveyed to Dr. Clifford, which he referenced in the IME,
    was relevant to whether the IME should be produced.  For the purpose of this
    appeal, AXA’s entitlement to a copy of the videotape and the IME turns exclusively
    on the operation of Rule 30.1.  </p>

  <h3><b>(1)       Reasons of the Motion Judge and the Divisional Court</b></h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge acknowledged that Rule 30.1 had its origin in the implied undertaking
    rule developed in the common law and recognized by this court in <i>Goodman
    v. Rossi</i> (1995), 24 O.R. (3d) 359.  However, he went on to identify two
    differences between the implied undertaking at common law and the deemed
    undertaking found in Rule 30.1.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    he noted that, as interpreted in <i>Tanner v. Clark</i> (2003), 63 O.R. (3d)
    508 (C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [2003] 3 S.C.R. viii, the
    common law implied undertaking constrained only the conduct of the recipient
    of the information and not the party who had disclosed the information in
    the discovery process.  The motion judge read Rule 30.1 as applying to all
    parties.  At paras. 25 and 27, he stated:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='
text-align:left'>[S]ubrule 30.1.01(3) <u>imposes the undertaking on “[a]ll parties
      and their counsel”.  This includes both the party disclosing the evidence
      and the party receiving it, as well as their respective counsel.</u>  By
      contrast, the focus in <i>Tanner v. Clark</i> was on the <i>recipient</i> of
      the information only.  As Carthy J.A. noted, the accident benefits insurer
      was bound by the undertaking, but the plaintiff (referred to as the
    “source” of the information) was not. …</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='
text-align:left'>Rather than focussing on the recipient of information, and imposing
    an implied obligation on that recipient, the rule focuses on the nature of
    the evidence in question.  If the evidence was obtained under one of the
    five enumerated procedures in sub-rule 1(a), then the use of that evidence
    is constrained by the rule.  These constraints are imposed on all parties
    and their counsel.  <u>Clearly, the drafters of the rule intended that it
    should apply not only to the parties and counsel in the original proceeding,
    but also to the parties and counsel where the specified evidence is sought
    to be introduced</u>.  [Italics in original; underlining added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    second difference identified by the motion judge concerns the scope of the
    undertaking.  In his view (at para. 29), the common law rule constrained
    only uses that were detrimental to the party that produced the information.  In
    contrast, the deemed undertaking set out in the Rule foreclosed use “for <i>any</i> purpose
    other than those of the proceeding in which the evidence was obtained.”  On
    the motion judge’s reading of the Rule, it was irrelevant whether the subsequent
    use was to the detriment of the party who produced the information.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge ultimately decided the motion on a point not raised or argued
    by counsel.  He drew the following distinction at para. 32:  “The point that
    was entirely missed in argument is that this rule constrains the <i>use</i> of
    evidence, it does not constrain the <i>disclosure</i> of evidence” (emphasis
    in original).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge concluded that although the Rule foreclosed use of the material,
    the plaintiff was compelled to produce a copy of the IME and the videotape
    to AXA.  AXA, however, could only use the material for impeachment purposes.  This
    limited use was found in the exception to the deemed undertaking created
    by rule 30.1.01(6).  If AXA wished to make broader use of the material, it
    would have to bring a motion under subrule (8).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Divisional Court agreed with the motion judge that the deemed undertaking
    rule, unlike the common law implied undertaking, applied not just to the
    recipient of the documents, but also to the discovered party, stating at
    para. 14:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='
text-align:left'>Because of the clear wording of Rule 30.1.01(3) and in particular
    to the phrase “(3) All parties and their counsel are deemed to undertake…”,
    we are unable to accept the submission of the respondent that it is only
    the recipient of discovery documents or evidence that is constrained from
    disclosing or using them outside the proceeding and that the discovered party
    is not constrained by the deemed undertaking rule in any way.  In addition
    to what we regard as the clear wording of the rule, it is obvious that in
    many instances the discovered party may have a privacy interest worthy of
    protection under the rule.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    Divisional Court, however, disagreed with the motion judge’s distinction
    between disclosing information otherwise captured by the deemed undertaking
    and using that information.  The
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court concluded that disclosure was a form of use and was captured
    by the deemed undertaking in subrule (3), indicating at para. 16:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='
text-align:left'>We would begin by recognizing that the routine disclosure of
    discovery evidence from a prior proceeding in a subsequent action would totally
    fail to give effect to the important privacy interests which form the basis
    of Rule 30.1.01, the deemed undertaking rule, and indeed its common law counterpart.  There
    does not appear to be any authority for the distinction between disclosure
    and use which the motion judge suggests.  The prohibited “use” in the Rule
    is a term sufficiently broad to include disclosure.  Indeed the case law,
    both at common law and under the deemed undertaking rule seems to protect
    the privacy of litigants by protecting the confidentiality of documents and
    information produced on discovery against any further disclosure without
    leave of the Court.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Divisional Court concluded that the videotape and the IME were protected
    from disclosure by the deemed undertaking rule, irrespective of which party
    was the discloser or recipient of the information, and directed that an application
    for relief from that rule should be made by way of motion to a judge of the
    Superior Court under subrule (8).  </p>
  <h3><b>(2)       Analysis</b></h3>
  <p style='

  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Rule
    30.1 is referred to as the deemed undertaking rule.  With respect to the
    contrary view, an interpretation of that Rule that extends the deemed undertaking
    to the party who provided the information and to strangers to the litigation
    in which the information was provided is inconsistent with the meaning of
    an undertaking in the litigation context. “Undertaking” is defined in <i>Black’s
    Law Dictionary</i>, 4th ed., revised, in part as:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='
text-align:left'>[A] promise given in the course of legal proceedings by a party
    or his counsel, generally as a condition to obtaining some concession from
    the court or the opposite party.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>An
    undertaking is a promise given by one party to another party to the lawsuit
    in exchange for obtaining something from that party.  Thus, in the discovery
    process, one party receives information from another party, and in exchange
    promises the other party that the information will not be used for any purpose
    other than the litigation at hand.  The disclosed information flows in one
    direction, from the discovered party to the discovering party.  The undertaking
    flows in the opposite direction, from the party obtaining the disclosure
    to the party giving the disclosure.  That undertaking does not limit what
    the discovered party can do in the future with its own information.  There
    is no reason for imposing an undertaking limiting future use of the information
    on the party who has suffered the burden of producing the information through
    compelled disclosure.  It is equally at odds with the accepted meaning of
    an undertaking to hold that parties who had no connection with the process
    in which the undertaking arose should, at some later time in some other litigation,
    find themselves bound by that promise or undertaking.  </p>

    meaning of an undertaking that controls the outcome of this appeal.  However,
    the rationale underlying the Rule, the language used in the Rule, and the
    jurisprudence of this court interpreting the Rule, all support an interpretation

    30.1 came into force on April 1, 1996:  O. Reg. 61/96, s. 2.  It is a direct
    descendant of the common law implied undertaking doctrine recognized by this
    court in <i>Goodman v. Rossi</i>.  The implied undertaking was recently described
    in these terms:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='

    implied undertaking promotes the due administration of justice in the conduct
    of civil litigation in two ways.  First, it encourages full and frank disclosure
    on discovery by the parties.  It does so by interdicting, except with the
    court’s permission, the subsequent use of the disclosed material by the party
    obtaining that disclosure for any purpose outside of the litigation in which
    the disclosure was made.  Second, the implied undertaking accepts that the
    privacy interests of litigants must, subject to legitimate privilege claims,
    yield to the disclosure obligation within the litigation, but that those
    interests should be protected in respect of matters other than the litigation:  <i>Juman
    v. Doucette</i>, at paras. 23-27; Richard B. Swan, “The Deemed Undertaking:  A

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Goodman
      v. Rossi </i>at p. 369, Morden J.A. quotes from Matthews and Malek’s <i>Discovery</i> (1992),
      at p. 253, where the rationale for the rule is described as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='
text-align:left'>The primary rationale for the imposition of the implied undertaking
    is the protection of privacy.  Discovery is an invasion of the right of the
    individual to keep his own documents to himself.  It is a matter of public
    interest to safeguard that right.  The purpose of the undertaking is to protect,
    so far as is consistent with the proper conduct of the action, the confidentiality
    of the party’s documents.  It is in general wrong that one who is compelled
    by law to produce documents for the purpose of particular proceedings should
    be in peril of having those documents used by the other party for some purpose
    other than the purpose of the particular legal proceedings…</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    promotion of full and frank disclosure, and the protection of the privacy
    interests of those who are compelled to make disclosure during discovery
    are both served by restricting the use that the party obtaining the information
    can make of that information.  Neither rationale for the implied undertaking
    justifies any restriction on the subsequent use of the information by the
    party who produced that information.  To the contrary, wrapping all information
    produced in the discovery process in one action in a cloak of non-disclosure
    for any subsequent purpose, and requiring a court order to remove that cloak
    of secrecy would inevitably interfere with the effective operation of the
    discovery process.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    language of Rule 30.1 confirms that it, like the common law implied undertaking,
    targets subsequent use by the recipient of information disclosed through
    the discovery process.  Subrule (1) identifies the material captured by the
    deemed undertaking.  Subrule (1)(a) refers to “evidence obtained under” the
    various discovery mechanisms described in subrule (1)(a).  Subrule (1)(b)
    extends the Rule to cover information obtained from evidence described in
    clause (a).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    verb “obtained” signals that the Rule applies to evidence (and derivative
    information) received through the discovery process and not to information
    provided in that process.  A party who receives evidence through compelled
    disclosure <i>obtains</i> that evidence.  The party who provides evidence
    through compelled disclosure does not <i>obtain</i> that evidence under any
    accepted meaning of the word.  Subrule (2) expressly excludes from the operation
    of the Rule any evidence (or derivative information) other than evidence
    obtained through the discovery process.  Consequently, if a party called
    upon to disclose evidence (or derivative information) in a subsequent proceeding
    did not obtain that evidence through the discovery process, the Rule has
    no application.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    undertaking applies to “evidence or information to which this Rule applies”.  That
    phraseology drives the reader back to subrules (1) and (2).  As indicated
    above, the Rule only applies to evidence (and derivative information) obtained
    through the discovery procedures identified in subrule (1)(a).  Consequently, “[a]ll
    parties and their counsel” who obtained evidence through those procedures
    are deemed to undertake not to use that evidence for any purpose other than
    purposes arising in the proceedings in which they obtained that evidence.  If
    the party called upon to disclose the evidence in a subsequent proceeding
    did not obtain that evidence (or derivative information) through discovery
    in the prior proceeding, the Rule does not apply and there is no deemed undertaking.  A
    party who provides evidence on discovery does not obtain that evidence through
    discovery.  That party’s subsequent use of that evidence is unaffected by
    the deemed undertaking rule.    </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Two
    other features of the Rule demonstrate that it applies exclusively to the
    party or parties who obtain the evidence on discovery.  Subrule (4) excludes
    from the deemed undertaking provision in subrule (3) a use “to which the
    person who disclosed the evidence consents”.  An outright exclusion from
    the deemed undertaking rule based on the unilateral consent of the disclosing
    party makes sense only if the Rule exists exclusively to protect the residual
    privacy interest of that party in the information it revealed on discovery.  An
    exclusion from the deemed undertaking based on the disclosing party’s consent
    is inconsistent with an interpretation of the Rule that makes the disclosing
    party subject to the undertaking.  On that reading, one subrule would make
    the disclosing party subject to the deemed undertaking, while another subrule
    would allow the disclosing party to escape the deemed undertaking, simply
    by consenting to the subsequent use.  One can hardly be said to be bound
    by an undertaking if one’s own consent can negate that undertaking.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Subrule
    (8) also assists in identifying the nature of the deemed undertaking rule.  It
    provides that the court may order that the deemed undertaking in subrule
    (3) does not apply to evidence, or information obtained from it, “if satisfied
    that the interest of justice outweighs any prejudice that would result to
    a party who disclosed evidence”.  Subrule (8) makes it clear that the party
    who disclosed the evidence through the compelled discovery process is the
    exclusive beneficiary of the protection afforded by the deemed undertaking.  It
    is that party’s privacy interests that can justify restriction on the use
    of information obtained through discovery outside of the litigation in which
    that information was obtained:  see <i>B.E. Chandler Co. v. Mor-Flo Industries
    Inc.</i> (1996), 30 O.R. (3d) 139 (Gen. Div.), at p. 142.    </p>

    arriving at the conclusion that the deemed undertaking Rule foreclosed use

    the Divisional Court referred to the opening language of subrule (3) and
    added, at para. 14, that “it is obvious that in many instances the discovered

    agree with this observation.  Indeed, I think that the discovered party has
    the only privacy interest protected under the Rule.  However, the protection
    of the privacy of the discovered party is neither served, nor justified,
    by an extension to the discovered party of the obligation not to use the
    information in a subsequent proceeding.  The protection of the discovered
    party’s privacy interest flows from the imposition of the undertaking limiting
    subsequent use on the discovering party.</p>

    use by the recipient of the information rather than against all uses of the
    information, Carthy J.A. went on to draw the parallel between the common
    law and Rule 30.1 at para. 6:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='
text-align:left'>It is “used by the other party” and “use them to the detriment
    of the party who has produced them” that are the keynote phrases.  <i>Rule
    30.1.01(1) speaks in the same voice – it is “evidence obtained” on discovery
    that shall not be “used”.  These verbs describe the acts of receiving and
    disseminating information; they do not label the evidence as sealed or privileged.  </i>The
    applicants in the AB proceedings submitted to medical examinations knowing
    that the information they impart will not be used by the two insurance companies
    except in those proceedings, and will not be communicated to others for their
    use in other proceedings.  That has not happened here.  The insurers in the
    tort proceedings are different companies and the information is sought, not
    from the insurers in the AB proceedings, but from the source of that information,
    the respective plaintiffs in the tort actions.  Those plaintiffs are not
    constrained in any way from the use of their medical information for any
    purpose.  What they argue for is not enforcement of an undertaking, but a
    protective shield against production of very relevant evidence.  [Emphasis

    are protected by the deemed undertaking from improper use by the discovering

    the videotape during discovery.  The fact that she is the subject of that
    videotape is irrelevant.  The plaintiff is bound by the deemed undertaking
    not to use the videotape except as permitted by the Rule.  The tort defendant,
    and not the plaintiff, is the beneficiary of that deemed undertaking.  The

    not “obtained” by the plaintiff in the course of the discovery.  The same

    during his examination.  The plaintiff’s obligation to produce her own medical
    information in the benefits action is unaffected by the fact that she had

    of the scope and purpose of the Rule.  The Rule has nothing to do with the
    nature of the information in issue, but turns exclusively on how the party
    called upon to disclose the information came into possession of that information:  <i>Juman
    v. Doucette</i>, at para. 25.  If the party obtained the information in the
    course of the discovery process, it is subject to the deemed undertaking
    rule regardless of whether the information is confidential.  If, however,
    the information was not obtained in the discovery process, the deemed undertaking
    rule has no application no matter how confidential the information might

    do not agree that Rule 30.1.01(6) requires the disclosure of protected evidence

    possession of material that is subject to the deemed undertaking rule.  They
    will not be permitted to use that material.  If, however, the occasion arises,
    they can use that material for impeachment purposes.  For example, if party “A” sues
    party “B” and obtains certain documents on discovery, the deemed undertaking
    rule will prohibit “A” from using those documents for any purpose outside
    of that litigation.  However, should party “A”
    become involved in a second lawsuit, subrule (6) would permit party “A” to
    utilize the evidence lawfully obtained in the prior action to impeach the
    testimony of a witness in the second proceeding.  There is no need to exempt
    production on discovery from scope of the deemed undertaking to give meaning

    on a motion under subrule (8).  The motion judge, at para. 38, mistakenly
    refers to the subrule as contemplating the balancing of the interest of justice
    against “any prejudice that would result to a party”.  As set out above,
    subrule (8) looks only at prejudice to the party who disclosed the evidence,
    in this case, the tort defendant.  Claims based on the recipient of the information’s

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='

    requires an applicant to demonstrate to the court on a balance of probabilities
    the existence of a public interest of greater weight than the values the
    implied undertaking is designed to protect, namely privacy and the efficient
    conduct of civil litigation.  In a case like the present, of course, there
    weighs heavily in the balance the right of a suspect to remain silent in
    the face of a police investigation, and the right not to be compelled to
    incriminate herself.  The chambers judge took the view (I think correctly)
    that in this case that factor was decisive.  In other cases the mix of competing
    values may be different.  <i>What is important in each case is to recognize
    that unless an <u>examinee</u> is satisfied that the undertaking will only
    be modified or varied by the court in exceptional circumstances, the undertaking
    will not achieve its intended purpose.</i>  [Emphasis added.]</p>

    for discovery and to disclose information in that testimony.  On the facts

    afforded by the deemed undertaking has no interest in availing itself of
    that protection.  In this case, the tort defendant has not expressed any
    concern about the production of the videotape or the IME in the benefits
    action.  Indeed, it is unclear whether the tort defendant is aware of the
    dispute over the production of this material.  The plaintiff resists disclosure,
    not for any reasons connected to the privacy interest of the tort defendant,
    the beneficiary of the undertaking, but for reasons of her own which, whatever
    merit they may have, have nothing to do with the rationale for the deemed
    undertaking.  On the present record, this case would appear to fit within

    the IME, and that subject to a judge’s order under rule 30.1.01(8), they
    cannot be disclosed by the plaintiff in the benefits action.  However, while
    this appeal was pending, the parties proceeded with their motion under subrule
    (8).  The motion judge ordered the plaintiff to produce the videotape, but
    refused to order production of the IME.  Both sides have obtained leave to
    appeal from that order to the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    Divisional Court.  The parties included a copy of the motion judge’s endorsement
    in the appeal book.  Those reasons must now be assessed in the light of these
    reasons.  </p>

    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court in the normal course.  One or both parties may, however,
    wish to make a motion under s. 6(2) of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>.  That
    section would allow this court to hear the appeal from the motion judge as
    long as this appeal was still outstanding in this court.  There was some
    discussion at the time of oral argument concerning the possible application
    of s. 6(2).  I think the parties should have an opportunity to revisit their
    positions with respect to that section after reviewing these reasons.  </p>

    than dismissing the appeal immediately, I would release these reasons and
    allow the parties an opportunity to decide whether either or both wish to
    bring a motion under s. 6(2) of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>.  The parties
    should inform this court within seven days of the release of these reasons
    whether any such motion will be brought.  If the motion is to be brought,
    counsel may arrange a conference call with me to work out the details.  If
    neither party decides to bring a motion under s. 6(2), an order can issue
    dismissing the appeal.  </p>

    parties agreed that the successful party on the appeal was entitled to costs
    in the amount of $14,000, inclusive of disbursements and GST payable upon
    the completion of the action.  If no motion is brought under s. 6(2) and
    the appeal is dismissed, the plaintiff is entitled to costs in that amount.  If
    a motion is to be brought under s. 6(2), I would not make any order as to
    costs until the matter is fully dealt with in this court.  </p>
