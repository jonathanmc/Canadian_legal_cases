    appellant was in what appeared to be a very minor rear end collision.  Initially,
    according to her, she seemed to suffer only relatively insignificant injuries.  However,
    as time went on, the appellant contended that she developed disabling headaches
    and chronic pain that eventually left her virtually totally disabled.  She
    sued the driver of the other vehicle.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    defence took the position that the appellant’s disabilities and complaints
    were exaggerated and properly attributable to a myriad of other causes unrelated
    to the car accident.  As is common in cases of this kind, there was conflicting
    expert medical evidence and the outcome turned in large measure on the jury’s
    assessment of the reliability of the appellant’s evidence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the course of the appellant’s evidence in-chief, she testified that she had
    received “around $45,000” to settle her claim against her own insurer.  The
    appellant testified that she had used the money to pay her lawyer and for
    various medical and rehabilitation related expenses.  The defence suggested
    that some of the expenses claimed by the appellant had in fact been paid
    through that insurance settlement.  Both counsel agree that the evidence
    concerning the insurance settlement formed a very minor part of the evidence
    heard in this trial.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge charged the jury carefully with respect to each of the heads
    damage and set out the respective positions of the party.  No objections
    were taken to his initial charge at trial and none is taken on appeal.  </p>

    is customary in civil jury trials, the trial judge asked the jury to return
    a verdict by answering a series of questions.  The first question was directed
    at the cause of the plaintiff’s injuries.  All of the remaining questions
    were directed at the jury’s quantification of the various heads of damage.  The
    jury concluded that the accident had caused or materially contributed to “any
    injury of the plaintiff’s”.  They assessed damages as follows:</p>

    receiving the jury’s verdict, the trial judge immediately advised the jury
    that there was a conflict between the jury’s finding that the accident had
    caused or materially contributed to the plaintiff’s injury and their failure
    to award anything for general damages.  The trial judge instructed the jury
    that if the accident caused or contributed to the plaintiff’s injuries, it
    must follow that the appellant had suffered some general damages.  He asked
    the jury to reconsider its answer to the question dealing with general damages.  The
    jury responded to this instruction with a question:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>We the jury feel
    that yes there was an injury sustained from this accident, but it was already
    compensated by the insurance settlement.  This is why the answer to question
    2a [re general damages] was $0, and question #1 was “yes”.  Do we need to
    compensate her?</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge answered the jury’s question by explaining to them that the settlement
    with her own insurer had nothing to do with general damages but was for certain
    expenses incurred prior to trial.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    jury retired and returned with an award of $50,000 for general damages.  Their
    assessment under the other heads of damage were not changed.  In response
    to the trial judge’s question, the jury indicated that it had dealt only
    with the question of general damages.  The jury were polled and five of the
    six jurors confirmed all of the answers given to them in respect of all of
    the heads of damages.  The appellant was awarded a total of $81,000.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for the appellant in his factum advanced several arguments arising out of
    the events which began with the jury’s initial verdict and culminated in
    their eventual award of $81,000.  In oral argument, counsel distilled these
    arguments to a single submission.  He contends that when it became apparent
    to the trial judge that the jury had improperly taken the insurance settlement
    into consideration in fixing general damages, the trial judge should have
    specifically instructed the jury to reconsider not only their award of general
    damages, but also their award under the other heads of damage.  Counsel submits
    that if we are satisfied that the trial judge erred in failing to do so,
    we should assess the damages in this court.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    cannot accept counsel’s argument.  This was a jury that was very capable
    of speaking up and explaining what they did and why they did it.  The jury’s
    initial explanation for awarding no damages for pain and suffering related
    only to that head of damage.  The jury’s question did not suggest that it
    had used the insurance settlement in any way in determining the awards under
    the other heads of damage, most of which clearly had nothing to do with the
    matters addressed in the insurance settlement.  We note that the jury did
    not simply make a zero award under all heads of damage in their initial response
    thereby suggesting that they had decided that the $45,000 obtained from the
    appellant’s own insurer was enough to cover all damages suffered by the plaintiff.  The
    jury awarded $31,000 in their initial responses to the questions.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    the jury returned with a reassessment of general damages at $50,000, the
    trial judge asked the jury whether it had dealt with the other heads of damage.  As
    indicated above, the jury advised the judge that they had reassessed only
    the general damages.  We are confident that this jury would have reassessed
    the other heads of damage had they in any way used the insurance settlement
    in assessing those heads of damage.  At a minimum, this jury would have spoken
    up and made it clear to the judge, as they did with the general damage award,
    that they had taken the settlement into consideration when assessing the
    other heads of damage.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge could have told the jury that the insurance settlement had nothing
    to do with any part of the jury’s assessment of damages.  We are not, however,
    satisfied that his failure to do so in these circumstances resulted in reversible
    error.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for the appellant also argues that the jury’s assessment is so plainly unreasonable
    and unjust as to warrant appellate intervention.  Counsel does not challenge
    the “0” award for lost income, but argues that the other assessments are
    manifestly unreasonable.  This was a case where the evidence reasonably allowed
    for very divergent views of the nature, extent and cause of the appellant’s
    various injuries and disabilities.  As the trial judge accurately pointed
    out in his cost award, the appellant faced “incredible evidentiary problems” in
    her attempt to convince the jury that all of her alleged problems stemmed
    from what appeared to be a very minor car accident.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    jury’s verdict reflects a determination by them that the accident caused
    some, not insignificant, problems for the appellant but did not cause the
    catastrophic result that she claimed.  For example, the jury’s award considered
    in its entirety is consistent with a conclusion that the appellant suffered
    not insignificant relatively short term pain combined with a minimal long
    term impairment of her earning capacity.  This assessment was one among many
    that the jury could reasonably have made on this record.  We cannot interfere.  </p>
