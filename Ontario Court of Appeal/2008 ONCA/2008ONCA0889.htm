    defendants appeal a jury verdict awarding the plaintiff, Harold MacDonald,
    $343,560 for general damages, past and future income loss, and loss of home
    maintenance and handyman services.  Mr. MacDonald was injured in a car accident
    in July 1997.  Because of the accident, he suffers from chronic myofascial
    pain in his left shoulder and neck.  His claim was governed by the Bill 59
    regime, which under s. 267.5(5) of the <i>Insurance Act</i> precluded claims
    for non-pecuniary loss unless the claimant sustained permanent serious disfigurement
    or permanent serious impairment of an important physical, mental or psychological
    function.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that, as a result of the accident, Mr. MacDonald sustained
    a permanent serious impairment of an important physical function, and thus
    met the threshold under s. 267.5(5) of the <i>Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants raised numerous grounds of appeal in their factum.  In oral argument,
    they focused on three:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    trial judge erred in refusing leave to the defence to call two expert, a
    chiropractor and an occupational therapist;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    trial judge did not adequately instruct the jury on future income loss; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    jury’s award of $92,500 for general damages was inordinately high.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    did not find it necessary to call on the respondent on any of these grounds.  Here
    are our brief reasons for dismissing the appeal.</p>
  <h3>1)        Refusal of leave to call the two experts</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants did not serve expert reports as required by r. 53.03 of the <i>Rules
    of Civil Procedure</i>.  Instead, they sought leave under r. 53.08 to call
    the experts after Mr. MacDonald, two doctors and another witness had testified
    for the plaintiffs.  The trial judge refused leave, ruling that to permit
    the defence to call the experts at this stage of the trial would cause undue
    delay and non-compensable prejudice to Mr. MacDonald.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants submit that the trial judge erred in his ruling.  Their principal
    contention is that non-compliance with r. 53.03 was “technical” at best.  They
    say that the respondent was aware these experts might be called because their
    reports were in the accident benefits file listed on the schedule for business
    records in the amended notice of intention.  We disagree with this submission.  The
    two reports were not separately and expressly listed either in the business
    records schedule or, where they should have been listed, in the schedule
    for reports of medical practitioners.  Thus, we think it was open to the
    trial judge to find prejudice and undue delay.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    basis for that finding is well grounded in the trial judge’s reasons.  He
    pointed out that the contents of the two expert reports had not been put
    to Mr. MacDonald of his three witnesses.  Thus, if he were to grant the appellants’ motion,
    all four witnesses would have to be re-called, which would have the effect
    of unfairly highlighting the contents of the reports for the jury and of
    unfairly distorting the way Mr. MacDonald had chosen to present his case
    to the jury.  As the trial judge pointed out, had the motion been made at
    the onset of the trial, he may well have taken a different view.  Accordingly,
    we do not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h3>2)        Instructions on future income loss</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge correctly instructed the jury on the law governing future income
    loss claims.  The appellants’ real complaint is that the trial judge did
    not tell the jury about what they contend was the weak or non-existent evidence
    supporting a future loss of income claim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    decline to give effect to this contention.  No objection to the instructions
    on future income loss was made at trial.  The absence of an objection weighs
    heavily against giving effect to this argument on appeal.  Moreover, there
    was evidence supporting Mr. MacDonald’s claim.  Had the trial judge instructed
    the jury on the weaknesses of the claim, he would have been bound to highlight
    its strengths.  That the trial judge did neither did not cause a miscarriage
    of justice.  Accordingly, this ground of appeal must fail.</p>
  <h3>3)        The award of general damages</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants submit that an award of $92,500 for general damages is excessive
    and that an award in the range of $35,000 to $45,000 is appropriate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    acknowledge that $92,500 in generous.  But, in our view, it is not so generous
    that it warrants overturning the jury’s assessment.  We notice that the defence
    counsel (not Mr. Yaniszewski) declined to suggest a range, asserting that
    damages were “nominal”.  The appellants’ position on appeal is therefore
    inconsistent with their position at trial and we decline to give effect to
    it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the appeal is dismissed with costs to the respondent in the agreed-upon amount
    of $15,000, inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The respondents’ cross-appeal
      of costs</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      respondents seek leave to appeal the costs award of just under $200,000.  If
      leave is granted, they wish to argue that the trial judge made three errors
      in the costs award.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First,
      they say that the trial judge erred in refusing to award costs on a substantial
      indemnity basis from the date of their first offer to settle.  They acknowledge
      that their second offer expressly revoked their first offer, thus taking
      it outside of r. 49.10.  However, they argue that r. 49.13 ought to apply,
      given that the second offer “seamlessly” replaced the first and that both
      offers were substantially lower than the judgment they obtained.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We
      accept that it was open to the trial judge to have taken that view of the
      offers: see <i>Thomas v. Bell Helmets Inc.</i>, 1999 Can LII 9312 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) at paras. 52-53. However, we decline to give effect to this ground because
    the argument is being advanced for the first time on appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      second ground raised on the cross-appeal is that the trial judge disallowed
      approximately 200 of the 400 hours docketed for trial preparation by plaintiffs’ counsel
      on the basis of a misapprehension that the plaintiffs’
    lawyers were claiming for two duplicate sets of trial preparation time.  We
    accept this argument.  In para. 19 of the reasons, the trial judge expressly
    states this saying “In essence, the plaintiff is claiming for two sets of
    preparation costs”.  Indeed, the defendants themselves acknowledged in their
    costs submissions to the trial judge that there had been minimal duplication
    of trial preparation time by the plaintiffs.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge’s misapprehension that the respondents had prepared for trial
      twice underpins his determination that the preparation time was excessive.  We
      accept that a reduction of 28.5 hours for duplication is warranted.  In
      so doing, we accept the figure proposed by the defendants below in this
      regard to the trial judge.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As
      well, we acknowledge the trial judge’s determination that the amount claimed
      for trial preparation was excessive.  Thus, in addition to the reduction
      for duplication, we accept the defendants’
    position at trial that a further reduction of 25 per cent would meet the
    reasonable expectation of the parties.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      third ground on the cross-appeal relates to the trial judge’s disallowance
      of time spent at trial on two unsuccessful motions to strike the jury.  We
      see nothing in this ground.  The plaintiffs were unsuccessful in those
      motions and it was within the trial judge’s discretion to disallow costs
      for those motions, despite the fact that they had been reasonably brought.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Accordingly,
      leave to appeal costs is granted and the cross-appeal is allowed in part.  An
      order shall go in accordance with these reasons.  We trust that the parties
      can resolve the mathematical calculations in order to implement the order
      but, if not, they may return to the panel for its assistance in that regard.  We
      would fix costs of the cross-appeal at $2,500, all inclusive.</span></p>
