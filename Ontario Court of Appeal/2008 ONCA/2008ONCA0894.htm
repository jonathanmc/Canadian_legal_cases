    appellants, Firestar Capital Management Corporation, Firestar Investment
    Management Group, and Michael Ciavarella, appeal from the order of Spence
    J., dated December 17, 2007, dismissing a motion to set aside default judgments
    for $3.2 million obtained by the respondent, HSBC Securities (
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    ) Inc.  The default judgments arose from a claim commenced by HSBC for indebtedness
    related to purchases in brokerage accounts held by Ciavarella and Firestar
    Capital at HSBC and allegations of an unlawful stock manipulation scheme
    involving trading in shares of Pender International Inc., a public company.  Before
    this court, the appellants filed fresh evidence in an attempt to demonstrate
    that they have a triable defence.</p>

    October 2004, once trading in Pender shares began, Ciavarella opened an account
    at HSBC in the name of Firestar Capital.  Jason Ng, a relatively new investment
    advisor employed by HSBC, dealt with the necessary application forms. The
    documentation included a personal guarantee executed by Ciavarella in favour
    of HSBC for all indebtedness of Firestar Capital regarding the trading account.</p>

    had sole trading authority over the Firestar Capital trading account. However,
    in October and November 2004, Ng accepted instructions from Mitton to purchase
    a series of Pender shares in the Firestar Capital account.  After HSBC had
    advanced its own funds to the vendors of the Pender shares on behalf of Firestar
    Capital, the Firestar Capital cheques for the purchases failed to clear,
    leaving HSBC out of pocket approximately US $2.324 million.  The debt owed
    to HSBC in relation to these share purchases was the subject of HSBCs claim
    against the appellants.  In addition, HSBC claimed that it had not been paid
    for other purchases of Pender shares, totalling approximately US $301,000. </p>

    legal proceedings ensued.  Ciavarella and Mitton were charged under the <i>Criminal
    Code </i>with conspiracy to commit fraud, fraud and laundering the proceeds
    of crime.  Mitton pleaded guilty to some of the charges and is currently
    serving a lengthy jail sentence. Ciavarella is awaiting trial.  Proceedings
    initiated by the Ontario Securities Commission against Ciavarella and the
    Firestar companies, which included cease trade and financial account freeze
    orders against Ciavarella and his Firestar companies, are ongoing.  Additionally,
    the Investment Dealers Association of Canada brought regulatory proceedings
    against Ng.  In a decision released in July 2007, Ng was found guilty of
    conduct unbecoming or detrimental to the public interest by accepting the
    trade orders of Pender stock, thereby facilitating the manipulation of that
    stock. </p>

    August 9, 2007, Ciavarella notified HSBC counsel for the first time that
    he would bring a motion to set aside the default judgments against him and

      filed an affidavit, sworn September 6, 2007 in support of the motion to
      set aside the default judgments.  He attempted to explain the delay in
      responding to both the claim and the default judgments, stating that until
      his attendance at the examination in aid of execution on April 30, 2007,
      he was not aware that the HSBC claim had proceeded without notice to him.   He
      further stated that he was financially unable to retain counsel.  In addressing
      the defence to the action, Ciavarella said that he intended to purchase
      only 200,000 Pender shares and that any additional Pender share purchases
      were unauthorized.  He took the position that since the purchase of the
      impugned shares was not authorized, neither he nor the Firestar companies
      were liable in respect of the HSBC claim.</span></p>
  <h2>II.        REASONS OF THE MOTION JUDGE</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge dismissed Ciavarellas motion to set aside the default judgments
    for two main reasons.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    he held that the materials filed and the submissions made did not offer an
    adequate explanation for the delay from December 2006, when Ciavarella was
    served with the statement of claim, and August 2007 when he first responded
    to the default judgments.  While Ciavarella claimed that he did not know
    about the judgments until April 2007, the statement of claim contained a
    clear warning that a failure to defend could result in judgments being granted
    in his absence, without further notice.  Ciavarella also asserted that after
    he learned of the default judgments he could not afford a lawyer.  However,
    the motion judge noted that Ciavarella had lawyers representing him and his
    companies in his other matters 
    lawyers who could have been asked to send a letter to HSBC advising that
    a motion to set aside would be brought.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge concluded that the evidence relating to Ciavarellas delay demonstrated inattention
    and inaction  an inadequate explanation for the purpose of a motion to
    set aside a default judgment.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='"Times New Roman"'>Second,
      the motion judge held that the materials filed and the submissions made
      did not show a triable defence on the basis, advanced by the appellants,
      that the impugned trades were unauthorized.  He found that the evidence
      did not support Ciavarellas position that the trades were unauthorized.  In
      fact, there was significant evidence to the contrary including that:</span></p>

    motion judge is entitled to considerable deference in the exercise of his
    discretion.  His decision should not be set aside absent an error in law
    or principle, a palpable and overriding error of fact, or unless the decision
    is so clearly wrong as to amount to an injustice: see e.g. <i>Hill v. Forbes</i> (2007),

    appellants allege that the motion judge conflated the first two parts of
    the test, and in applying the third, engaged in an analysis of the credibility
    of the appellants defence, rather than determining whether an arguable defence
    was established.  In my view, the motion judges reasons demonstrate that
    he properly applied the three-part test. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    considering the circumstances of the default, and the delay in moving to
    set aside the default judgments, the motion judge considered and rejected
    the appellants position that Ciavarella was distracted by other matters
    and financially unable to retain a lawyer to represent him and his companies.  There
    was ample support in the record for his conclusion and I can see no reason
    to interfere.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ciavarella
    has clearly established that he is more than capable of managing his complicated
    affairs.  In addition to his extensive professional experience, Ciavarellas
    level of sophistication is evident from the materials filed in this proceeding
    that he prepared on his own behalf.  It was against this background that
    Ciavarella was served with and had the opportunity to read the statement
    of claim, which contained clear notice of the consequences of the defendants
    failure to respond.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    throughout the period of inaction after Ciavarella learned of the default
    judgments, he was represented by experienced lawyers who could have written
    a letter to HSBC advising that a motion would be brought to set aside the
    default judgments.  The motion judges conclusion that Ciavarellas legal
    and financial difficulties did not interfere with his ability to respond,
    in a timely manner, to the statement of claim, and to the judgments rendered
    in default, was well supported by the evidence before him.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    considering whether the appellants had raised an arguable defence  that
    the impugned trades were unauthorized  the motion judge stated:</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;'>Mr. Ciavarellas Affidavit
    stated [sic] that he did not authorize the trades is a self-serving statement.  It
    is not supported by other evidence, the evidence to the contrary demands
    a response but none is given in the evidence before the court.  On the basis
    of the record before the court, a court could not conclude that Mr. Ciavarellas
    statement was reliable. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants submit that the motion judges reasoning demonstrates that he
    erred by assessing credibility.  I disagree.  In my view, the motion judges
    reasons make it clear that he did exactly what he was supposed to do  he
    took a good hard look at the merits and assessed whether the moving parties
    had established an arguable defence.  As the motion judge observed, Ciavarellas
    September 2007 affidavit was self-serving and devoid of detailed evidence
    supporting his key assertion that the trades were unauthorized.  The appellants
    did not provide the motion judge with any independent evidence corroborating
    their position.  I see no reason to interfere with the motion judges conclusion
    that a self-serving affidavit does not create a triable issue in the absence
    of detailed facts and supporting evidence.  This is especially true where,
    as the motion judge noted, the assertions in the 2007 affidavit were inconsistent
    with Ciavarellas own previous evidence and the evidence of his conduct in
    relation to the trades at issue.  </p>

    appellants also advance an interests of justice argument.  They submit
    that the motion judge failed to consider that they would be significantly
    prejudiced if the judgments are not set aside, whereas there would be no
    prejudice to HSBC if the claim were to proceed to trial.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

      of Ontario Inc. v. 1565627 Ontario Ltd.</i> (2007), 87 O.R. (3d) 479, at
      para. 2, this court indicated that on a motion to set aside a default judgment,
      the motion judge will be guided by the principles established by the authorities
      but must ultimately determine whether the interests of justice favour granting
      the order.  The motion judge should consider the potential prejudice to
      the moving party if the motion were dismissed, the potential prejudice
      to the respondent if the motion were allowed, and the effect of any order
      on the overall integrity of the administration of justice.       </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

    as a whole, the motion judges reasons demonstrate that he was alive to whether
    the interests of justice favoured granting the order to set aside the default
    judgments.  He adverted to matters relevant to the interests of justice,
    such as his belief that Ciaravella was gaming the process, that Ciavarellas
    delay in responding to both the claim and the default judgments reflected
    only inattention and inaction, and that his affidavit contained self-serving evidence
    in an effort to establish a defence.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Given
    the motion judges unassailable conclusions that the appellants were unable
    to adequately explain the circumstances giving rise to the default or the
    delay once aware that judgments had been rendered in default, that they were
    unable to raise a triable defence on the merits, and further, that Ciavarella
    was effectively taking his chances with the process, it is not in the interests
    of justice to set aside the default judgments.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, the motion judge properly exercised his discretion in dismissing
    the motion to set aside the default judgments.  His reasons do not reveal
    an error in principle, or a palpable and overriding factual error, and his
    decision does not amount to an injustice.  </p>

    question remaining is whether the proposed fresh evidence should be received
    and if so, what impact it would have had on the disposition of the motion.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    proposed new evidence takes two forms.  First, there is evidence Ciavarella
    relies upon in response to HSBCs allegations that he had notice of the unauthorized
    share purchases.  It relates primarily to the fax number HSBC used to send
    the trade confirmations and the extent to which Ciavarella was able to use
    his internet access to review the status of his and the Firestar Capital
    accounts.  Ciavarella claims that this evidence was not before the motion
    judge because his lawyer, Maggisano, failed to follow his instructions to
    adduce it on the motion. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    there is the transcript of Ngs testimony at Ciavarellas preliminary inquiry
    indicating that Ng accepted trading instructions from Mitton, without properly
    signed trading authorization.  The appellants argue that this evidence was
    not in existence at the time the motion was argued.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants submit that the fresh evidence could have affected the motion
    judges determination given its relevance to the key issue whether the Pender
    share purchases were authorized and further, it would be unjust to permit
    the judgments to stand in the face of a meritorious defence centred on the
    fact that they did not authorize the impugned share purchases.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In

    the first and fourth components.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='"Times New Roman"'>The
      first form of proposed fresh evidence, relating to whether Ciavarella was
      notified of the Pender share purchases, </span>existed at the time the
      motion was heard.  There is nothing to indicate that it could not have
      been provided to the motion judge before he became <i>functus officio</i>,
      other than<span style='"Times New Roman"'> Ciaverellas </span>uncorroborated
      evidence that his lawyer failed to follow instructions.<span style='"Times New Roman"'>  Further,
      it does not address the other evidence relating to confirmation
     most significantly, the evidence that confirmations were mailed to Ciavarellas
    address one day after each transaction, and that the transactions were confirmed
    to Ciavarella by telephone calls from HSBC at the end of each trading day.  This
    proposed fresh evidence could not be expected to have affected the result
    on the motion.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, the second form of proposed fresh evidence, Ngs testimony at Ciavarellas
    preliminary inquiry,<span style='"Times New Roman"'> is not fresh evidence.  Although
    this evidence was not in the form of testimony at Ciavarellas preliminary
    inquiry until after the motion was heard, there is no suggestion that Ng
    was not accessible to the appellants earlier in the proceedings to give evidence
    about his interactions with them concerning the purchase of Pender shares. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

      significantly, this proposed fresh evidence relates only to whether Ciavarella
      gave Ng <i>written</i> authorization to take trading instructions from
      Mitton.  It does not contradict Ngs evidence that Ciavarella <i>orally</i> authorized
      him to take instructions from Mitton, which is the evidence upon which
      the motion judge relied.  </span>Accordingly, I am not convinced that this
      evidence would have affected the motion judges findings.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='"Times New Roman"'>The
      most significant problem the appellants face, which is not addressed by
      the proposed fresh evidence, is that their claim that they did not know
      about or authorize the impugned trades came late in the day.  The first
      opportunity Ciaverella had to complain that he did not know about or authorize
      the trades was on November 24, 2004.  Neither his correspondence that day,
      nor his 2005 affidavit in response to the OSC investigation, which put
      the trades in issue, makes any mention of this claim.  In fact, everything
      Ciaverella was saying, until he swore his September 2007 affidavit, was
      consistent with his having known about and authorized the share purchases. </span></p>
