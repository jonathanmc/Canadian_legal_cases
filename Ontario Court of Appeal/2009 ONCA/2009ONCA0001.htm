    Belvedere met Jeffrey Brittain on June 17, 2000.  Three days later, they
    commenced living together until Mr. Brittain’s untimely death in a farming
    accident on May 8, 2002.  During the course of the relationship, Mr. Brittain
    expressed his intention that on his death he would transfer his five Registered
    Retirement Savings Plans (“RRSPs”) to Ms. Belvedere, provided they were still
    living together.  In order to accomplish this objective, he asked Ms. Belvedere
    to sign a cohabitation agreement and he, in turn, would change his will.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately
    when Mr. Brittain died, no cohabitation agreement had been signed and his
    will had not been changed.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Belvedere commenced an action against the Canada Trust Company as the trustee
    of Mr. Brittain’s estate.  She claimed a broad spectrum of relief, including
    a claim for an interest in the assets of the estate by reason of a constructive
    or resulting trust and damages for unjust enrichment.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge issued a declaration that Ms. Belvedere was entitled to a constructive
    trust in Mr. Brittain’s RRSPs at the time of his death, to be satisfied by
    payment to Ms. Belvedere of $1,750,000.  Mr. Brittain’s estate appeals.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal.</p>
  <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
  <h2>(a)       The relationship</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Brittain was 53 years old in June 2000.  He had separated from his second
    wife, Rosemary Rich, in January of that year.  He had custody of his four
    year-old son.  Mr. Brittain was involved in the insurance business from which
    he had amassed considerable wealth.  He lived on a working farm in Princeton,
    Ontario with his son in a house which he shared with his elderly mother.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the time of his death, the assets in his estate were valued at approximately
    $6 million.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Shortly
    after Mr. Brittain separated from his second wife, he was introduced to Ms.
    Belvedere through a mutual friend, Angela Campbell.  Initially, there was
    simply telephone contact as Ms. Belvedere lived in Mississauga.  Then on
    June 17, 2000, Ms. Belvedere visited Mr. Brittain at his residence with Angela
    Campbell and her husband, George Campbell.  The next day, Mr. Brittain and
    his son visited Ms. Belvedere at her home in Mississauga.  They stayed the
    night.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Apparently
    there was instant mutual attraction and Mr. Brittain invited Ms. Belvedere
    to move to the Princeton farm with him and his son.  Ms. Belvedere accepted,
    and the couple lived together from June 20, 2000 until Mr. Brittain’s death
    in May 2002.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Belvedere was 45 years old when she moved in with Mr. Brittain.  She was
    unmarried and had no children.  She was a long-standing employee of Air Canada,
    but had been on sick leave since September 1999.  She owned a house and a
    car.  In September 2001, she sold her car to her niece for the outstanding
    balance owing to a finance company.  For a period of time, she rented out
    her house and then in March 2002, she sold it for $215,000.  The net proceeds
    of the sale, which closed after Mr. Brittain’s death, were approximately
    $70,000.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the time of Ms. Belvedere’s move from Mississauga, there were no promises
    made by Mr. Brittain concerning his RRSPs.  He did not propose marriage to
    her at that time.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Belvedere maintained her seniority as an Air Canada union employee throughout
    her relationship with Mr. Brittain.  She returned to work at Air Canada one
    day per week in October 2000.  After several months, Ms. Belvedere opted
    to take advantage of Air Canada’s policy of shift transfers, which allowed
    her to pay another employee to work her shift for her.  Although she suffered
    a net loss in pay, as found by the trial judge, the advantage to Ms. Belvedere
    was that she maintained her employment status, including seniority and entitlement
    to benefits.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    of June 2001, Ms. Belvedere did secretarial work in Mr. Brittain’s office
    four days a week.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Belvedere had expenses in relation to her car until she sold it and the expenses
    of carrying her house during part of the cohabitation.  These expenses were
    to some extent off-set by $400 per month rent from her roommate between June
    2000 and July 2001.  From July 2001 to May 2002, the house was fully rented
    at the rate of $1,250 a month, which covered all costs.  She also had some
    expenses related to her family’s condominium in Florida.  Ms. Belvedere testified
    that, although she was unable to provide the details, in terms of her earnings
    and expenses, she was “breaking even”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    their 23-month relationship, Mr. Brittain paid all Ms. Belvedere’s living
    expenses which included housing, food and the use of a car. 
    He provided her with gifts of jewellery, valued at $20,000, and purchased
    clothing for her.  In short, Mr. Brittain paid for anything Ms. Belvedere
    needed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    her part, Ms. Belvedere used her Air Canada travel privileges to take Mr.
    Brittain and his son on occasional trips to her family’s condominium in Florida
    and elsewhere including Mexico, Bermuda, Jamaica, Arizona, Hawaii, Boston
    and various destinations in Canada.  Mr. Brittain and Ms. Belvedere made
    it a habit to travel at least one week each month.  The Air Canada travel
    privileges and use of the condominium were valued at $30,000 by the trial
    judge.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    well, Ms. Belvedere, through her employment, was able to include Mr. Brittain
    and his son under the Air Canada health plan after the first year of their
    cohabitation.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    the relationship, Ms. Belvedere cleaned Mr. Brittain’s house and cooked for
    him and his son.  Prior to Ms. Belvedere’s arrival, Mr. Brittain paid a housekeeper
    $100 every two weeks to do the housecleaning.  The housekeeper was terminated
    when Ms. Belvedere suggested that she was no longer required.  Ms. Belvedere
    provided babysitting for Mr. Brittain’s son when the boy was not in daycare.  She
    also assisted with some chores around the farm.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Belvedere testified that while on vacation in Hawaii in February 2002, Mr.
    Brittain proposed marriage to her.  They agreed that the wedding would be
    held on July 13, 2002.  They also agreed that, except for a few close friends,
    the engagement and wedding date were to be kept secret until some undisclosed
    date.</p>
  <h2>(b)       The cohabitation agreement and the RRSPs</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    the course of the relationship, there were discussions concerning the appropriate
    provision for Ms. Belvedere in the event of Mr. Brittain’s death.  In September
    or October 2000, during a social visit with Angela Campbell and her husband,
    Mr. Brittain showed Ms. Belvedere a copy of a cohabitation agreement between
    himself and his second wife, Ms. Rich.  This agreement stipulated that in
    the event of Mr. Brittain’s death, provided they were still living together,
    Ms. Rich would receive Mr. Brittain’s RRSPs.  If they separated, Ms. Rich
    would receive nothing.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Brittain had made changes by hand to the Rich agreement and asked Ms. Belvedere
    to sign it.  Ms. Campbell apparently suggested to Mr. Brittain that he should
    have a new agreement drafted and also include in it a provision for Ms. Belvedere
    if they separated before Mr. Brittain’s death.  After further discussion,
    he agreed to have a new agreement drafted.  Mr. Brittain also agreed to pay
    $1,000 per month in the event of separation and upon his death, a lump sum
    calculated on the basis of $1,000 per month for each month of cohabitation.<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[1]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Brittain indicated that he would have his solicitor, Paul Amey, draft the
    appropriate cohabitation agreement.  It was agreed that when the cohabitation
    agreement was drafted, Ms. Belvedere would take it to her own solicitor for
    independent legal advice before signing.  The evidence at trial, which included
    Mr. Brittain’s personal notes, revealed that the cohabitation agreement was
    to be done before a will was prepared.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Brittain also consulted a business colleague, Stewart MacDonald, concerning
    the preparation of an estate plan, but no cohabitation agreement was ever
    produced.  Mr. Brittain’s last will, which makes no reference to Ms. Belvedere,
    was dated January 31, 2001.  This will was made during the time of the continuing
    discussions concerning the cohabitation agreement.  Mr. Brittain’s son was
    the main beneficiary under the will.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    further complicate matters, when Mr. Brittain met with his estate planner
    in November 2001, he referred to his last will as one dated March 18, 2000.  In
    addition, notes that Mr. Brittain made on the estate plan dated January 7,
    2002, made by Mr. Brittain, make no reference to a will dated January 31,
    2001.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    respect of the above evidence, the trial judge noted: “All of this makes
    it extremely hard to determine Brittain’s true intent even if able to determine
    what he said he intended.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Also,
    on January 15, 2002, Mr. Brittain changed the beneficiary on a Sun Life group
    insurance policy from Ms. Belvedere to his estate.  The value of this policy
    was $100,000.  The trial judge commented that that change was “not helpful” in
    determining Mr. Brittain’s specific intent.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Belvedere testified that she was aware that the January 31, 2001 will made
    no reference to her and that she was removed as the beneficiary from the
    Sun Life insurance policy.</p>
  <h2>THE REASONS OF THE TRIAL JUDGE</h2>
  <h2>(a)       The factual findings of the trial judge</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge concluded his review of the evidence of Mr. Brittain’s intention
    as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>As stated, all of the evidence is consistent with
    the conclusion that I make:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>In the event of his death, if cohabiting, Brittain
    intended to substantially benefit [Ms. Belve-dere].  The intention to benefit
    [Ms. Belvedere] was consistent with a benefit valued at $2 million, the approximate
    value of the RRSPs at the time of the preparation of the estate plan in January
    2002.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    respect of the characterization of the relationship between Ms. Belvedere
    and Mr. Brittain, the trial judge was of the view that, although the period
    of cohabitation was short (23 months), their commitment to each other was
    genuine and lasting.  He therefore concluded that the relatively short duration
    of the relationship was “a serious factor to be considered, but it is not
    determinative” of whether a constructive trust ought to be recognized.</p>
  <h2>(b)       The trial judge’s conclusion that Ms. Belvedere was entitled
    to a constructive trust in the RRSPs</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Relying
    on the judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Peter v. Beblow</i>,
    [1993] 1 S.C.R. 980, the trial judge considered the relevant factors for
    the establishment of a constructive trust: enrichment of the defendant, a
    corresponding deprivation of the plaintiff and the absence of any juristic
    reason for the enrichment.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that Mr. Brittain was significantly enriched by the various
    services and benefits provided by Ms. Belvedere as follows: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I find [Ms. Belvedere] performed domestic engineering
    services/duties, including housekeeping, meals, laundry, gardening, vegetable
    gardening, lawn mowing, some modest amount of snow removal, stone picking,
    loading of wood to be transported, child care in all of its aspects for Kenny,
    making available health benefits through Air Canada, making available through
    Air Canada benefits of rights to air flights and accommodation for father
    and son with minimal flight costs and other travel requirements obtainable

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    respect of a corresponding deprivation experienced by Ms. Belvedere, the
    trial judge considered the following:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Except for working Fridays for approximately one
    year, [Ms. Belvedere] has given up active work with Air Canada.  Through
    the use of shift selling, she has maintained her status and seniority with
    Air Canada.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Brittain encouraged her to sell her new motor vehicle,
    sell her recently acquired home, sell and/or dispose of her furniture.  In
    selling Air Canada shifts, she was able to maintain status and seniority,
    but she did so at a financial cost.  The reference has been to selling shifts,
    but in application [Ms. Belvedere] pays the purchaser to take her shift.  She
    paid out more per hour in that regard than she was receiving as a paid employee
    of Brittain.  As indicated above, [Ms. Belvedere] has had a disproportionate
    emotional response and/or breakdown arising out of Brittain’s untimely death.  She
    has not worked since and she remains unable to work as to the time of trial.  Although
    there is no medical evidence before me, I make what I believe to be a reasonable
    conclusion that the time when she will be able to return to work cannot be
    determined.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    making the above observations, the trial judge concluded that Ms. Belvedere “suffered
    deprivation exceeding the lifestyle enjoyed.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    respect of the absence of juristic reason, the trial judge held that even
    if Ms. Belvedere’s lifestyle had arguably improved as a result of cohabiting
    with Mr. Brittain, this did not constitute a juristic reason for the enrichment.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge concluded his analysis by observing that the “common theme throughout
    the entirety of the evidence” was that Ms. Belvedere would be taken care
    of, and that there was no dispute that Mr. Brittain had intended for her
    to receive his RRSPs as a spousal rollover if he died during the course of
    their relationship.  The trial judge held that Ms. Belvedere was entitled
    to a constructive trust in the RRSPs at the time of Mr. Brittain’s death.  In
    lieu of the fact that taxes had been paid and the RRSPs no longer existed,
    he fixed an award in Ms. Belvedere’s favour in the amount of $1,750,000.</p>

  <h2>ANALYSIS</h2>
  <h2>(i)        Did the trial judge err in finding that Mr. Brittain was unjustly
    enriched?</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Pettkus
      v. Becker</i>, [1980] 2 S.C.R. 834 at p. 848, the Supreme Court of Canada
      set out a three part test for a finding of unjust enrichment:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>an
    enrichment enjoyed by the defendant;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>a
    corresponding deprivation suffered by the plaintiff; and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(3)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    absence of a juristic reason for the enrichment.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for the appellant submits that the trial judge erred in finding that Ms.
    Belvedere had suffered any deprivation and that he failed to balance the
    benefits exchanged between Ms. Belvedere and Mr. Brittain.  He further submits
    that there was no unjust enrichment in this case because the benefits provided
    by Mr. Brittain were greater than the benefits provided by Ms. Belvedere.  Alternatively,
    the net benefit to Mr. Brittain was <i>de minimus</i>.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    particular, counsel for the appellant argues that the Air Canada benefits
    (travel and health insurance) were available to Ms. Belvedere through her
    employment regardless of her cohabitation with Mr. Brittain and were of nominal
    cost to her.  During the relationship, Ms. Belvedere maintained her seniority
    status with Air Canada and she did not have to encroach upon her assets.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to the benefits conferred by Ms. Belvedere, the trial judge found
    that the airline passes and use of the Belvedere condominium had an estimated
    value of $30,000.  There was evidence of income reported on Ms. Belvedere’s
    tax return for her services as a housekeeper and for daycare services related
    to Mr. Brittain’s son - $4,800 and $3,287 respectively.  However, these appear
    to be notional figures.  No money was in fact transferred to Ms. Belvedere.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for the appellant argues that the corresponding benefits received by Ms.
    Belvedere from Mr. Brittain (room and board, use of a vehicle at no cost,
    expensive gifts, clothing and monthly vacations) far outweigh the benefits
    conferred on Mr. Brittain.  Counsel submits that if the trial judge had attempted
    to balance the value of the services rendered and received, he would have
    realized that his conclusion that Ms. Belvedere “suffered deprivation exceeding
    the lifestyle enjoyed” was patently unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    take from the trial judge’s reasons that he found four categories of deprivation
    experienced by Ms. Belvedere:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She
    gave up active work with Air Canada.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(ii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She
    sold her car for a low price at Mr. Brittain’s suggestion.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(iii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She
    sold her house for less than she thought it was worth and disposed of her
    furniture.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(iv)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She
    was not compensated for her domestic labour, apart from notional income reported
    on her income tax return which presumably benefited Mr. Brittain.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the categories of deprivation as found by the trial judge are not
    sufficient to establish a claim for unjust enrichment.  Although Ms. Belvedere
    may have suffered a small loss to transfer her Air Canada shifts, this practice
    allowed her to maintain her benefits and seniority with Air Canada.  I also
    note that Ms. Belvedere was on leave from her job at the time she began cohabiting
    with Mr. Brittain, and so she could not be said to have given up
    “active work” with Air Canada as a result of commencing that relationship.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    well, while Ms. Belvedere arguably gave up something of value in selling
    her car and her house, she did not experience a financial loss from having
    done so (on the contrary, she made a profit on the sale of her house), and
    in any event, there was no evidence that Mr. Brittain was enriched by these
    transactions.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    regard to Ms. Belvedere’s provision of domestic services, it is clear that
    such services are capable of forming the basis for a claim in unjust enrichment:
    see <i>Pettkus v. Becker</i> at p. 849 and <i>Sorochan v. Sorochan</i>, [1986]
    2 S.C.R. 38 at pp. 44-5.  That said, it is equally clear that the conferring
    of a benefit does not, by itself, constitute unjust enrichment: see <i>Lovsin
    v. Hodgins Estate</i>, (2008), 39 E.T.R. (3d) 170 (Ont. C.A.) at para. 7. 
    Rather, what is required, and what the trial judge failed to do in this case,
    is to balance the benefits conferred and received by the parties to determine
    whether the claimant’s contribution is sufficient to entitle her to compensation.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    it stands, the trial judge’s conclusion that Ms. Belvedere “suffered deprivation
    exceeding the lifestyle she enjoyed” is not supported by the evidence.  While
    it is clear that Mr. Brittain benefited from Ms. Belvedere’s care and companionship
    in the ways discussed above, it is equally clear that she, too, benefited
    significantly from the relationship.  On Ms. Belvedere’s own evidence she
    was “breaking even” financially during their relationship.  She added that
    in terms of her happiness, “it went up 500 percent”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the trial judge erred in finding that Ms. Belvedere’s
    “disproportionate emotional response” to Mr. Brittain’s death provided a
    legal basis for a claim in unjust enrichment.</p>
  <h2>(ii)      Did the trial judge err in finding a constructive trust?</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    my conclusion that the trial judge erred in finding that Mr. Brittain had
    been unjustly enriched, it follows that he erred in finding a constructive
    trust in Ms. Belvedere’s favour.  However, even if unjust enrichment had
    been made out in this case, there are two reasons why a constructive trust
    would not have been an appropriate remedy. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    a constructive trust is available as a remedy for unjust enrichment only
    where monetary damages are inadequate: see <i>Peter v. Beblow</i> at p. 997.  In
    this case, had unjust enrichment been established, monetary damages would
    clearly have been an adequate remedy.  At the time of his death, Mr. Brittain’s
    estate was valued at approximately $6 million.  There were more than adequate
    funds to compensate Ms. Belvedere for her claim of unjust enrichment.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    in addition to the above requirement, there must be a link between the contribution
    that founds the action and the property in which the constructive trust is
    claimed: <i>Peter v. Beblow </i>at p. 988; see also <i>Sorochan </i>at p.
    50.  In this case, Ms. Belvedere did not contribute, directly or indirectly,
    to Mr. Brittain’s RRSPs, and whatever potential interest she might arguably
    have had would, in any event, be limited to Mr. Brittain’s last two payments
    of $13,500 per year during the time of the cohabitation.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for Ms. Belvedere submits that the required link need not always take the
    form of a contribution to the actual acquisition of the property.  In these
    circumstances, she contends that the link between the contribution and the
    asset could be the promise to transfer the RRSPs to Ms. Belvedere in return
    for her contribution to Mr. Brittain’s life.  I do not agree with this submission.  And
    even if the promise of the RRSPs was sufficient to establish such a link,
    which I do not accept, the submission ignores the issue of whether a monetary
    award would be a suitable remedy.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    I agree with counsel for the appellant that the trial judge erred in finding
    that intent was relevant to the establishment of a constructive trust.  In <i>Rathwell
    v. Rathwell</i>, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 436, Dickson J. wrote at pp. 454-5: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The court will assess the contributions made by
    each spouse and make a fair, equitable distribution having regard to the
    respective contributions.  The relief is part of the equitable jurisdiction
    of the court and <u>does not depend on evidence of intention</u>.  [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    in my view, the trial judge failed to take into account that Mr. Brittain’s
    intention to transfer the RRSPs was conditional upon Ms. Belvedere signing
    a cohabitation agreement and Mr. Brittain changing his will. 
    This evidence was never challenged.  Indeed, it was the evidence of Ms. Belvedere.  For
    reasons never adequately explained in the record at trial, no cohabitation
    agreement was ever produced and Mr. Brittain did not change his will.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Brittain could easily have made the transfer by naming Ms. Belvedere as a
    beneficiary in the RRSPs or by designating Ms. Belvedere as a beneficiary
    under his will.  He did neither.</p>
  <h2>(iii)     Did the trial judge err in valuing the award at $1,750,000?</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    have already found that the trial judge erred in finding unjust enrichment
    and imposing a constructive trust.  However, even if a claim for unjust enrichment,
    payable in monetary damages, had been made out, in my view the amount awarded
    to Ms. Belvedere was patently unreasonable.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where
    damages are the remedy for unjust enrichment, the trial judge ought to proceed
    on a “value received” approach: see <i>Bell v. Bailey</i>, (2001), 203 D.L.R.
    (4<sup>th</sup>) 589 (Ont. C.A.) at para. 38.  In this case, the services
    Ms. Belvedere provided that arguably merit compensation were domestic labour,
    Air Canada travel and health benefits, and use of her family’s Florida condominium.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    considering the services provided by Ms. Belvedere, the following factors
    need to be placed on the other side of the scale:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    benefits Ms. Belvedere received from Mr. Brittain – Ms. Belvedere testified
    that “he took care of everything … he bought me anything I wanted”;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(ii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Brittain shared child care responsibilities as a custodial father to his
    son; </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(iii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Brittain’s son attended day care five days a week, except in the summer months; </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(iv)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Belvedere and Mr. Brittain vacationed at least one week every month
    – sometimes it was two weeks.  Ms. Belvedere testified that she did not even
    bother to take her wallet with her on vacation; and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(v)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Air Canada benefits were available to Ms. Belvedere through her employment
    at no cost to her, and Mr. Brittain picked up whatever extra costs there
    were in respect of the Air Canada travel passes and related benefits.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    the various services and benefits provided by Ms. Belvedere are viewed in
    their totality and balanced with the benefits received by her from Mr. Brittain,
    it is not possible to attribute a value to them of $1,750,000. 
    Counsel for the appellant submitted that the trial judge effectively awarded
    damages at a rate equivalent to $2,500 per day of cohabitation.  While this
    may not be the appropriate way of looking at the matter, it does place a
    different perspective on the trial judge’s award.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    have no difficulty in concluding that even if damages for unjust enrichment
    were available in this case, the amount awarded was patently unreasonable.  </p>
  <h2>(iv)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Should
    the trial judge have considered the alternative remedies of resulting trust
    and proprietary estoppel?</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    my conclusion that there was no unjust enrichment, it is probably unnecessary
    to consider the alternative remedies.  However, resulting trust and proprietary
    estoppel were put to us by counsel for Ms. Belvedere as alternative approaches
    to the case in the event that we found the trial judge erred in applying
    the doctrine of constructive trust.  I will therefore consider them briefly.</p>
  <h2>(a)       Resulting Trust</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for Ms. Belvedere submits that the trial judge’s award of $1,750,000 may
    be justified by the application of the doctrine of resulting trust.  She
    cites <i>Rathwell</i> in support of this proposition.  I do not accept her
    submission.  In <i>Rathwell</i>, the court restricted the application of
    the doctrine to those circumstances where the claimant actually contributed
    to the acquisition or improvement of the asset over which the resulting trust
    is claimed.  Dickson J. said at p. 451:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>If at the dissolution of a marriage one spouse alone
    holds title to property, it is relevant for the court to ask whether or not
    there was a common intention, or agreement, that the other spouse was to
    take a beneficial interest in the property … <u>It is relevant and necessary
    for the courts to look to the facts and circumstances surrounding the acquisition,
    or improvement, of the property.  If the wife without title has contributed,
    directly or indirectly, in money or money’s worth, to acquisition or improvement,
    the doctrine of resulting trusts is engaged.  An interest in the property
    is presumed to result to the one advancing the purchase moneys, or part of
    the purchase moneys</u><i>.</i> [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    discussed above, Ms. Belvedere made no such contribution to the acquisition
    of or improvement of the RRSPs.  </p>
  <h2>(b)       Proprietary Estoppel</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the trial judge referred to promissory estoppel and counsel for Ms. Belvedere
    referred to both promissory estoppel and proprietary estoppel, the argument
    before us was restricted to proprietary estoppel.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Eberts
      v. Carleton Condominium Corp. No. 396</i> (2000), 136 O.A.C. 317 at p.
      323, Finlayson J.A., speaking for the court, described proprietary estoppel
      as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>… The basic tenets of proprietary estoppel are described
    in McGee, <i>Snell’s Equity</i>, 13 ed. (2000) at pp. 727-28:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>Without attempting to provide a precise or comprehensive
    definition, it is possible to summarize the essential elements of proprietary
    estoppel as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>(i)  An equity arises where:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>            (a)
      the owner of land (O) induces, encourages or allows the claimant (C) to
    believe that he has or will enjoy some right or benefit over O’s property;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>(b)   in reliance upon this belief, C acts to
    his detriment to the knowledge of O; and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>(c)   O then seeks to take unconscionable advantage
    of C by denying him the right or benefit which he expected to receive …</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for Ms. Belvedere asserts that, failing the application of the doctrines
    of constructive trust or resulting trust, Ms. Belvedere should be entitled
    to invoke the doctrine of proprietary estoppel in order to give legal effect
    to Mr. Brittain’s expressed intention.  I disagree.</p>

    if the doctrine of proprietary estoppel extends to chattels, and there is
    some controversy on this point, I am satisfied that Ms. Belvedere’s claim
    does not meet the requirement of detrimental reliance referred to by <i>Snell</i> and
    cited with approval by Finlayson J.A. in <i>Eberts</i>.  There is no evidence
    that Ms. Belvedere relied to her detriment on Mr. Brittain’s promise of a
    future interest in the RRSPs when she moved to the Princeton farm.  Even
    if it could be said that she remained on the farm because the promise had
    been made, it cannot be said that she remained on the farm for the next 17
    or 18 months to her detriment.  The above analysis in respect of unjust enrichment
    would suggest otherwise.</p>

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the trial judge and dismiss
    the action.</p>
  <h2>COSTS</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would fix the costs in favour of the appellant on a partial indemnity scale
    in the amount of $25,000 including disbursements and GST.  If the appellant
    seeks costs of the trial, we can be spoken to and directions will be given.</p>

    to the $1,000 per month for on-going support.</p>
