    Burley seeks to set aside the order of Justice M.G.J. Quigley dated November
    19, 2007, dismissing his motion to vary spousal support, terminate daycare
    expenses and reapportion s. 7 payments, all of which arise pursuant to an
    earlier consent order granted by Justice Tulloch.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Burleys were married on June 22, 1996 and separated on January 18, 2004.  They
    divorced in August, 2005.  They have two children, Abigail and William, presently
    9 and 6 years old, respectively.  The appellant is a firefighter employed
    by the Toronto Fire Services.  At the time of the motion before Quigley J.,
    the respondent was a student at

    some protracted litigation, the parties entered into Minutes of Settlement
    at a Settlement Conference that took place before Justice Tulloch.  They
    resolved all issues in dispute regarding custody, access, child and spousal
    support, and equalization of net family property.  The agreement, which was
    embodied in a formal order dated March 9, 2006 (the “2006 Consent Order”),
    included the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>shared
    custody of the children, who would continue to have their primary residence
    with their mother, with liberal access to the appellant as set out in a monthly
    residency schedule;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>payment
    by the appellant to the respondent of:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(i)     child support in the amount of $897
    per month, based on the appellant’s then declared income of $67,000; </p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(ii)    spousal support in the amount of $1321
    per month, to be reviewed in three years; and</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(iii)  daycare expenses of $732.17 (76% of
    the s. 7 expenses under federal guidelines).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant has never made these payments in full, notwithstanding his sworn
    statement in his Change of Information Form filed in support of the variation
    in April, 2007, that “I am paying spousal support to the Applicant in the
    amount of $1,321.00 per month and have been paying this amount since April
    1, 2006”.  He has a long history of non-compliance with support orders in
    the proceedings.  At the time of the Settlement Conference he was $60,000
    in arrears, a deficiency he satisfied by conveying his half interest in the
    matrimonial home to the respondent.  He appears to be short, on average,
    approximately $770 per month in payment of his obligations under the 2006
    Consent Order.  At the time of the motion to vary in September, 2007, his
    arrears had accumulated to $11,155.65.  By March 3, 2008 – the last figures
    available
    – they were $15,928.85.  While acknowledging that the appellant was financially
    pressed, the motion judge viewed the history and continuing pattern of arrears
    quite negatively.  Since filing his notice of appeal, the appellant has made
    a voluntary assignment in bankruptcy, although the bankruptcy will not discharge
    his court ordered child and support obligations: the<i> Bankruptcy and Insolvency
    Act</i> R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3, as amended, s. 178(1)(c). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the Settlement Conference many things were discussed as the parties worked
    their way toward an agreement.  The appellant argues that the daycare expenses
    were only to continue for another year because it was anticipated that William
    would be out of daycare by that time.  He further contends that his agreement
    to pay spousal support was conditional upon the respondent’s representation
    that she expected to be in full-time attendance at school for the next 3½ years,
    completing her B.A. and pursuing a law degree – she had applied to law school
    but had not yet been accepted – and that she would not be working. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Shortly
    after the Settlement Conference, the respondent began working part-time during
    the summer at a men’s wear store owned by her father in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Oakville.  She earned $23,444.85 for the year 2006.  In February 2007 – partly
    because her father had become ill and partly (she maintains) because the
    appellant’s failure to comply with his support obligations had required her
    to put her education plans on hold – she began working full- time at the
    store.  At the time the variation motion was heard, she was earning income
    at the rate of $4,166 per month ($49,992 per annum), according to her updated
    Financial Statement.  The appellant’s declared annual income by that time
    had increased to $75,838, according to his 2006 income tax return.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    was an issue whether the appellant – who worked seven 24-hour shifts a month
    as a firefighter – was earning additional undeclared income from a sideline
    home renovation business he conducted.  The motion judge was not able to
    resolve this issue, but he was troubled by the fact that the appellant had
    not disclosed the income he declared on a mortgage application which resulted
    in his being approved for an approximately $400,000 mortgage and by the fact
    that the appellant “claimed to be unable to make use of his very substantial
    amount of free time for further income producing pursuits.”  He found that
    the appellant had not made full and frank disclosure.  The motion judge declined,
    nonetheless, to impute additional income to the appellant for the purposes
    of the motion then before him.  But he concluded that “it is necessary to
    get to the bottom of the issue of the actual amount of income being earned
    by Mr. Burley”, and granted leave to the respondent “to bring a further motion
    solely to have the issue of income quantification addressed”.  Having declined
    to impute further income to the appellant, the motion judge also declined
    to impute income to the respondent beyond the $23,000 amount (her part-time
    income) shown on her 2006 T-1 tax return.  He ordered that the s. 7 expenses
    be apportioned on a $76,000/$23,000 ratio.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant put forward an array of arguments on the appeal.  However, they
    may be distilled down to four central assertions.  The appellant argues that
    the motion judge erred in:</p>
  <p class="Doubleindent-quote">a)    failing to find a material change in the
    circumstances of the parties;</p>
  <p class="Doubleindent-quote">b)    assessing the respondent’s income at $23,000
    for the purposes of determining her proportionate obligation to contribute
    to s. 7 expenses and in failing to make other required adjustments in that
    calculation;</p>
  <p class="Doubleindent-quote">c)    characterizing the correspondence and methods
    of communication used by the appellant as “harassing”
    and “threatening”, giving rise to a need for a restraining order; and</p>
  <p class="Doubleindent-quote">d)    ordering costs on a substantial indemnity
    basis.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Did the Motion Judge Err in
      Failing to Find a Material Change in the Circumstances of the Parties?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s principal ground of appeal is that the motion judge erred in
    failing to find a material change in the circumstances of the parties justifying
    a variation of the 2006 Consent Order.  He says this for the following reasons.  First,
    and foremost, he relies on the fact that the respondent is now earning income
    as a member of the work force, whereas at the time of the Settlement Conference
    she was a full-time university student planning on continuing her education
    and entering law school.  Second, he argues that the motion judge failed
    to take into account that there was now a shared parenting arrangement in
    place
    – pursuant to a separate order of the court – that gave him more time with
    the children and that would enable him to provide the daycare services that
    were to have been, but were not, terminated a year after the 2006 Consent
    Order.  Finally, he contends that the respondent received certain tax benefits
    in 2006 which constituted a change in circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    17(1) of the <i>Divorce Act</i>, R.S.C., 1985, C.3, as amended, permits the
    court to vary a support order where there has been a change in circumstances.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  The jurisprudence is clear that courts are reluctant
    to interfere with support orders and will not do so unless the reasons disclose
    an error in principle or a significant misapprehension of the evidence, or
    unless the order is clearly wrong.  Because of the fact-based and discretionary
    nature of such an order, judges are to be given considerable deference by
    appellate courts when such decisions are reviewed.  Their discretion is to
    be exercised, however, in accordance with the four objectives set out in
    s. 17(7) – which are designed to reflect the principle that the economic
    consequences of marriage and of separation and divorce are to be equitably
    shared between the former spouses – namely that the variation order should:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>recognize
    any economic advantages or disadvantages to the former spouse arising from
    the marriage or its breakdown;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>apportion
    between the former spouses any financial consequences arising from the care
    of any child of the marriage over and above any obligation for the support
    of any child of the marriage;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>relieve
    any economic hardship of the former spouses arising from the breakdown of
    the marriage; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>d)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>in
    so far as practicable, promote the economic self-sufficiency of each former
    spouse within a reasonable period of time.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>See <i>Hickey
      v. Hickey</i>, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 518, at paras. 10-11.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    the change in circumstances must be material and not trivial or insignificant: <i>Hickey</i>,
    at paras. 14 and 20-22; <i>Willick v. Willick</i>, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 670.  In <i>Willick</i>,
    at p. 688, Sopinka J. said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In deciding whether the conditions for variation
    exist, it is common ground that the change must be a material change of circumstances.  This
    means a change, such that, if known at the time, would likely have resulted
    in different terms.  The corollary to this is that <i>if the matter which
    is relied on as constituting a change was known at the relevant time it cannot
    be relied on as the basis for variation</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,
    the motion judge concluded there had been no material change in circumstances
    that could bring about a reduction in the spousal support payable to the
    respondent – at least for the three years ending on March 9, 2009 – in spite
    of the alteration in the respondent’s working situation.  He founded this
    conclusion on two bases.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    he rejected the appellant’s submission that the respondent had “represented” during
    the Settlement Conference that she would not work as a precondition to his
    paying the amount of spousal support to which he had agreed.  Instead, after
    reviewing the transcript of the meeting with Justice Tulloch, the motion
    judge found that
    “what was contemplated in addition to his obligation to pay child support
    to [the respondent] as the custodial parent of their two children was a three
    year period during which Mr. Burley would provide spousal support to Ms.
    Burley to permit her to get back on her own economic feet, and to permit
    her to get through second year of law school.”  He rejected as well the appellant’s
    contention that it was never contemplated or foreseeable that the respondent
    would need to take on employment.  Rather – the motion judge concluded – it
    was inevitable that the respondent would have to take on some employment
    because it could not reasonably have been expected that she could support
    herself and the two children on the amount she was to receive from the appellant.  The
    need to supplement her income was even more “obvious” should the appellant – as
    he did – fail to comply with his support obligations.  As the motion judge
    observed in his reasons (at para. 12):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In the face of Mr. Burley’s continuing breach of
    his obligations under the 2006 Consent Order, his suggestion that the burden
    imposed on Ms. Burley by those circumstances should now result in the termination
    of her spousal support is inappropriate and without merit, and even more
    surprising is his claim that she ought to be required to provide a rebate
    to him for the limited payments he has made.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    record amply supports the motion judge’s findings and conclusions, and I
    can find no basis for interfering with his decision in this regard.  This
    is particularly so because the support arrangements are open to be reviewed
    in March 2009 by virtue of the terms of the 2006 Consent Order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second – and
    following from the foregoing – the motion judge found that “there has been
    no material change in Mr. Burley’s continuing failure to make all of the
    payments to Ms. Burley that he has agreed to make at various times.”  He
    noted that at the time of the Settlement Conference arrears had accumulated
    in excess of $60,000.  Tulloch J. had attempted to deal with this situation
    by encouraging an agreement “that would permit the parties to move forward
    and permit Mr. Burley to get out from under the burden of those arrears but
    also establish a new framework for the payment of support going forward that
    Mr. Burley could and indeed would meet.”  Hence the agreement to satisfy
    past arrears by the transfer of the appellant’s half interest in the matrimonial
    home to Ms. Burley.  However, the appellant fell into arrears under the 2006
    Consent Order almost immediately. While the motion judge appears to have
    mistakenly stated that arrears had accumulated to “some $17,000”
    by the time he heard the motion, they had risen to almost $12,000 by then.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is well-recognized that a court has discretion not to entertain an application
    by a payor spouse who is in continuous default: <i>Dickie v. Dickie, </i>[2007]
    1 S.C.R. 346, at paras. 4 and 6.  The motion judge declined to exercise that
    discretion in this case.  However, in these circumstances, I see no error
    in his reasoning that “Mr. Burley’s continuing non-compliance with [the 2006
    Consent Order] must necessarily impact on his right to ask the court to grant
    the relief he seeks.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge was alive to the appellant’s claim that because of the shared
    parenting arrangement and his availability, he could provide the daycare
    required.  He rejected it, however.  He said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[25] With respect to daycare costs, I accept Ms.
    Burley’s assertion that it continues to be in the best interests of the children
    to continue in daycare as recommended by the parties’
    previous Parenting Coordinator/Mediator, Ms. Coco Johnson.  The claim of
    Mr. Burley that he is available and can provide all the daycare that the
    children require is rejected.  While he does have a “flexible” work schedule
    with the Toronto Fire Department, this neither guarantees that he will be
    available to provide daycare when required, either on a scheduled or last
    minute basis.  More importantly, however, in my view Mr. Burley has been
    as casual in his provision of time to care for the children as he has been
    in meeting his financial obligations to Ms. Burley, and it is unrealistic
    at this time to have any expectation that Mr. Burley could provide the reliable
    level of daycare for the children that they require.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge’s decision that daycare should continue in the best interests
    of the children, and not be replaced by leaving the children in the appellant’s
    care for these purposes, was open to him on the record and should not be
    interfered with.  It follows that the shared parenting arrangement cannot
    be said to give rise to a material change in circumstances for variation
    purposes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the motion judge did not specifically consider the assertion that the respondent
    had received certain tax benefits and other deductions in this context, I
    do not think they can be said to give rise to a material change in the circumstances
    either.  First, they must have been reasonably anticipated at the time of
    the 2006 Consent Order.  Second, any benefit obtained will have been more
    or less offset by the appellant’s arrears in spousal support payments.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would not give effect to the “material change” ground of appeal.</p>
  <h3>Did the Motion Judge Err in Assessing the Respondent’s Income at $23,000
    for Purposes of Determining Her Proportionate Obligation to Contribute to
    Section 7 Expenses and in Failing to Make Other Required Adjustments?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent’s T-1 General return for 2006 showed that she had earned $23,444.85
    during that year.  This reflected her income while working part-time in her
    father’s store when she was still attending
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">
    Wilfrid
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Laurier
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    University.  By the time of the motion to vary, however, she was working
    full-time in the store and was earning an annual income of approximately
    $50,000.  Nonetheless, the motion judge determined the parties’ proportionate
    shares of section 7 expenses for the children based upon a $23,000 income
    for the respondent and a $76,000 income for the appellant.  The appellant
    submits that he erred in doing so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the circumstances of this case, I do not agree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    26.1(2) of the <i>Divorce Act</i> provides that the federal child support
    guidelines (“the Guidelines”) are “based on the principle that spouses have
    a joint financial obligation to maintain the children of the marriage in
    accordance with their relative abilities to contribute to the performance
    of that obligation.”  In terms of a spouse’s proportionate share of s. 7
    expenses under the Guidelines, the “guiding principle” is “that the expense
    is shared by the spouses in proportion to their respective incomes”: Guidelines,
    s. 7(2).  In determining spousal income, the starting point is that “a spouse’s
    annual income is determined using the sources of income set out under the
    heading ‘Total income’
    in the T1 General form issued by the Canada Revenue Agency and is adjusted
    in accordance with Schedule III”: Guidelines, ss. 15(1) and 16.  At the same
    time, however, s. 2(3) of the Guidelines states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Where, for the purposes of these Guidelines, any
    amount is determined on the basis of specified information, the most current
    information must be used.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The
    appellant argues that, while the respondent’s 2006 T1 form showed earnings
    of $23,000, the best information – “the most current information” – before
    the court demonstrated that she was earning full-time income at the rate
    of approximately $50,000 per year.  The motion judge was required to apply
    this income, he says.  In addition, he submits that the motion judge failed
    to make two required adjustments in arriving at the spouses’ proportionate
    shares of s. 7 expenses: (i) he did not deduct spousal support paid to the
    respondent in adjusting the appellant’s income, as required by Schedule III,
    s. 3 of the Guidelines; and (ii) he failed to take into account the income
    tax benefit the respondent enjoyed from deducting child care expenses from
    her income for tax purposes: Guidelines, s. 7(3).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    determining support for purposes of the Guidelines, the court is to do so
    on the basis of the information before it: <i>Schaeffer v. Schaeffer</i>,
    2001 SKQB 121 (CanLII).  However, the court is not required to turn a blind
    eye when it is satisfied it has not been given an accurate picture of one
    party’s income.  That was the case here.  Normally, the motion judge would
    have been required to apply – and undoubtedly would have applied – the most
    current and reliable information before him.  In this case, however, he had
    reason to believe that the appellant had not made full and frank disclosure,
    whereas the respondent had.  He was therefore satisfied that he did not have
    a true picture of the appellant’s income.  It was for that reason that he
    gave the respondent leave to apply again to have the appellant’s true income
    determined.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge did not accept the appellant’s assurances that he was no longer
    engaged in his sideline home renovation business.  He was concerned that
    the appellant had refused to divulge the amount of income he had claimed
    on his mortgage application.  He decided on a compromise in the circumstances.  On
    the one hand, he would not impute income to the appellant beyond the $76,000
    reported on his 2006 tax return.  On the other hand, he would not impute
    income to the respondent, either, beyond the $23,000 reported on her 2006
    return, which was the most recent tax return and is consistent with s. 16
    of the Guidelines. “[F]or the purposes <i>of temporarily fixing</i> their
    proportionate obligations to contribute to shared expense relating to their
    children”, he concluded that he would allocate the sharing of s. 7 expenses
    in proportion to those incomes (emphasis added).  He did so pending a further
    motion by the respondent – if so advised – “to have the issue of income quantification
    addressed.”  He therefore ordered the expenses to be shared on a 77%/23%
    ratio, rounding up the appellant’s share by one percentage point for ease
    of reckoning.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    issue of tax-benefit offsets and adjustments to income for purposes of s.
    7 calculations is subsumed as well in this approach for temporarily fixing
    the parents’ respective shares of these costs.  As I have already noted,
    the appellant’s continued default in making his spousal support payments,
    combined with the motion judge’s finding that he failed to make full income
    disclosure, more or less offset any tax benefits or other adjustments that
    might otherwise have been made in respect of the parties’ incomes under the
    Guidelines.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    the circumstances, I am not persuaded that the motion judge erred in his
    approach to apportioning s. 7 expenses.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant raised a number of other alleged errors in written argument.  Only
    two of them need be mentioned.</p>
  <h3>Did the Motion Judge Err by Characterizing the Correspondence and Methods
    of Communication Used by the Appellant as “Harassing” and “Threatening” Giving
    Rise to the Need for a Restraining Order?</h3>
 
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the appellant attacked the motion judge’s characterization of his correspondence
    and methods of communicating with the respondent as “harassing” or “threatening”,
    giving rise to the need for a restraining order.  The motion judge found
    that “Mr. Burley’s continuous harassment of [Ms. Burley] by e-mail, telephone
    messaging, and personal attendances at her home and at her parents’
    home for reasons other than those related to their children” exceeded the
    communications he was entitled to engage in for purposes of his relationship
    with the children.  He observed that it would be preferable if the parties
    set up “a regime of regular weekly or bi-weekly scheduled contact … to permit
    them to exchange necessary communications relating to their children, but
    without the level of frequency that appears to have become the norm in this
    case and that has become a source of annoyance to Ms. Burley and her family.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I read the motion judge’s reasons and his order, he did not make a restraining
    order.  He urged the parties to agree on an arrangement along the lines he
    suggested and provided, if they could not, that they could arrange an appointment
    before him and he would “issue an appropriate order at that time.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    record supports his findings as to the nature and extent of the appellant’s
    conduct, and his disposition of the issue was an exercise in good sense in
    the circumstances.</p>
  <h3>Did the Motion Judge Err in Awarding Costs on a Substantial Indemnity Basis?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the appellant criticizes the motion judge’s order for fixing costs on a substantial
    indemnity basis.  The costs of a proceeding, and the scale of those costs,
    are matters within the court’s discretion, however.  Rule 24(5)(a) of the <i>Family
    Law Rules</i> permits the court to take into account a party’s behaviour
    in relation to the issues from the time they arose.  In light of the appellant’s
    pattern of default, I see no error in the motion judge’s decision to fix
    costs on a substantial indemnity basis.</p>
  <h3>DISPOSITION</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the foregoing reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    submitted their respective costs outlines, together with offers to settle
    that were exchanged prior to the hearing of the appeal.  The offers to settle
    were commendable attempts to resolve all outstanding issues between the parties
    but they are of little guidance in fixing costs because it is difficult to
    compare them with the issues determined on appeal.  In my view, this is not
    a case for substantial indemnity costs on the appeal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    parties’ claims for costs are similar.  The respondent is entitled to the
    costs of the appeal, fixed in the total amount of $17,643.15, including disbursements
    and GST.</p>
