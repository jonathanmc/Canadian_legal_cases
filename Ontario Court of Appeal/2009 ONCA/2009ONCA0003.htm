  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>    This
    is one of the worst cases of civil contempt to come before this court.  In
    1993, Jay Chiang acknowledged that he owed the respondents, Korea Data Systems
    Co. Ltd. and Korea Data Systems (USA) Inc. (“KDS”), over $8 million.  Since
    that time, he has not paid any money to KDS.  Instead, over the past 15 years
    he and his wife, Christina Chiang, have engaged in a concerted course of
    conduct to frustrate KDS’s efforts to collect its debt.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Chiangs’ conduct has included transferring millions of dollars to their parents
    in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    California and
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Taiwan</st1:country-region>
    ; receiving money back from their parents when needed to maintain their lavish
    lifestyle in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Toronto; and continually breaching court orders requiring them to disclose
    the whereabouts of their assets.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    July, 2003, the Chiangs consented to a finding and a declaratory order that
    they were in contempt of six previous orders of the Superior Court.  Under
    the terms of this consent order, the Chiangs were given an opportunity to
    purge their contempt by complying with a series of undertakings, each of
    which required disclosure of financial information.  Failing compliance,
    they were each to be incarcerated for seven days, and faced the prospect
    of further sanctions for continued non-compliance. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    a trial in 2005, Farley J. found that the Chiangs had answered some undertakings,
    but had not fully complied.  He gave them a further 90 days to do so.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    2007, after a seven-day trial, Lax J. concluded that the Chiangs still had
    not fulfilled their undertakings and therefore, remained in contempt of the
    previous court orders.  She sentenced Jay Chiang to imprisonment for one
    year and Christina Chiang to imprisonment for eight months.  When Ontario’s
    Parole and Earned Release Board granted Jay Chiang parole, the trial judge
    quashed the order of the Board and issued a replacement warrant of committal
    to ensure that Jay Chiang serve his entire sentence in custody.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Chiangs appeal all orders of the trial judge.  They submit that the trial
    judge misunderstood the nature of her inquiry and erroneously placed the
    burden on them to show that they had purged their contempt.  They submit
    that they have used all reasonable means to answer their undertakings to
    disclose the whereabouts of their assets but that their family refuses to
    cooperate with them.  They also submit that the trial judge erred in imposing
    the sentences she did either because the July, 2003 consent order precluded
    her from imposing sentences of greater than seven days or because sentences
    of one year and eight months are excessive.  Finally, the Chiangs submit
    that the Parole Board had jurisdiction to grant parole and that the trial
    judge had no jurisdiction to issue a replacement warrant of committal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>KDS
    submits that this court should not even entertain the Chiangs’ appeal until
    they have purged their contempt.  This appeal therefore, raises the following
    six issues:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-US>(1)       Should this court hear the Chiangs’ appeal?</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-US>(2)       Did the trial judge misunderstand the nature of the proceedings
      before her and misapply the onus of proof?</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-US>(3)       </span>Did the trial judge err in finding that the Chiangs
    had not fulfilled their undertakings?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(4)       Did the trial judge err in sentencing
    Mr. Chiang to one year imprisonment and Mrs. Chiang to eight months imprisonment?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(5)       Did the trial judge err in concluding
    that the Parole Board did not have jurisdiction to grant parole to Jay Chiang?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(6)       Did the trial judge err in issuing a

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>B.        CIVIL CONTEMPT OF
      COURT </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  To
    give context to the issues on this appeal, we briefly review the law of contempt
    of court.  The parties agree on the main principles.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Our
    law has distinguished between civil and criminal contempt of court.  A person
    who breaches a court order, other than an order for payment of money, commits
    civil contempt of court: see rule 60.11(1) of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>,
    R.R.O 1990, Reg. 194.  The contempt here is breach of orders requiring financial
    disclosure.  Where the breach is accompanied by an element of public defiance
    or public depreciation of the court’s authority, the contempt becomes criminal:
    see <i>United Nurses of
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Alberta v.
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Alberta (Attorney General)</i>, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 901.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    distinction between civil and criminal contempt is not always clear cut.  Both
    have a common root: only by having the ability to exercise the power of contempt
    can judges maintain respect for our courts and for the rule of law.  Moreover,
    recent case law has recognized that even in purely private litigation, the
    breach of a court order and the resulting sanction for contempt invariably
    reflect public disrespect for the authority of the court: see <i>Vidéotron
    Ltée v. Industries Microlec Produits Électroniques Inc.</i>, [1992] 2 S.C.R.
    1065 and <i>Pro Swing Inc. v. Elta Golf Inc.,</i> [2006] 2 S.C.R. 612.  Nonetheless,
    the distinction persists and the case before us is undoubtedly a case of
    civil contempt of court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    civil contempt, the court’s emphasis is less about punishment and more about
    coercion – attempting to obtain compliance with the court’s order.  Still,
    civil contempt bears the imprint of the criminal law.  Civil contempt must
    be made out to the criminal standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt.  And,
    a person found in civil contempt of court may be committed to jail or face
    any other sanction available for a criminal offence, such as a fine or community
    service: see <i>Pro Swing</i>, at paras. 34-35.</p>

      refused to pay for them.  In 1993, to settle the dispute, Jay and Julius
      Chiang personally agreed to pay KDS $8.5 million.  But they did not do
      so.  Their refusal to pay KDS spawned litigation both in

    $390,000 in securities and $240,000 US to his mother-in-law, $310,000 to

      essence, the Chiangs say the trial judge failed to recognize that their
      contempt ended with the consent order in July, 2003.  Instead, she conducted
      an inquiry into whether the Chiangs were still in contempt of the 2003
      order.  That inquiry, however, according to the Chiangs, should have required
      KDS to establish a fresh contempt to the accepted standard of proof beyond
      a reasonable doubt.  Yet, the trial judge placed the onus on the Chiangs
      to show on a balance of probabilities that they had purged their contempt.  In
      support of this submission, the Chiangs rely on the judgment of the Alberta
      Court of Appeal in <i>Re Braun</i> (2006), 262 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>)
      611.</span></p>

      do not accept the Chiangs’ submission.  The trial judge embarked on an
      inquiry to determine two interconnected matters: first, whether the Chiangs
      had answered their undertakings, thus purging the contempt they agreed,
      in 2003, that they had committed; and second, if they had not purged their
      contempt, what sanctions were warranted under the terms of the July 2003
      order.  There could have been no confusion about the nature of the trial
      judge’s inquiry.  The parties agreed to it.  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      Chiangs’ submission really amounts to a misunderstanding of the 2003 order
      in which they consented to a declaration and finding beyond a reasonable
      doubt that they were in contempt of six previous court orders and to the
      implication of appropriate sentences.  In the hearing before the trial
      judge the Chiangs were given an opportunity to purge their contempt by
      demonstrating compliance with their undertakings.  Until they did so, they
      remained in contempt of the earlier court order, and subject to additional
      sanctions in accordance with its terms.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We
      accept that <i>Re Braun</i> appears to reject the idea that a civil contempt
      may warrant successive orders imposing incremental penal sanctions.  In
      that case, Ms. Braun was repeatedly sentenced to periods of incarceration
      for civil contempt arising from her failure to provide an affidavit and
      attend examinations for discovery as ordered by the court.  The Alberta
      Court of Appeal found these repeated penal sanctions to be wrong.  Berger
      J.A., writing for the panel, held that the continued failure to comply
      amounted to one contempt, which cannot be the subject of repeated periods
      of incarceration.  In effect, Ms. Braun’s contempt crystallized at the
      moment of her non-compliance.  Further penal sanctions would be warranted
      only if a fresh contempt order was obtained.  Berger J.A. did, however,
      allow for further non-penal sanctions if the contempt continued after the
      period of imprisonment, and “if the unpurged contempt affects the fair
      adjudication of the suit”.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    are reluctant to endorse the reasoning in <em>Re Braun</em> for two reasons.  First,
    its reasoning seems at odds with the coercive purpose of civil contempt.&nbsp; To
    permit only one penal sanction for the ongoing breach of an order deprives
    the court of the ability to impose measured, but incremental, sanctions to
    obtain compliance with that order. In other words, if the court can impose
    only one period of incarceration for a civil contempt, then it cannot address,
    in any meaningful way, a contemnor's continuing defiance. If repeated penal
    sanctions are permitted, the court can always address a concern that these
    sanctions may become oppressive. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second,
      and equally important, Ontario’s <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i> appear
      to provide more flexibility in sentencing for civil contempt than Alberta’s <i>Rules
      of Court</i>, Alta. Reg. 390/68.  In
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario, rule 60.11(5)(a) permits the court to impose a sentence of imprisonment “for
    such a period and on such terms as are just”.  This flexibility is incorporated
    into rule 60.11(5)(b), which provides that a contemnor may “be imprisoned
    if the person fails to comply with a term of the order”.  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>By
      contrast, in

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Alberta, rule 704(1) provides that a person in civil contempt is liable to “imprisonment
    until he has purged his contempt” or to “imprisonment for not more than 2
    years”.  These provisions may restrict the sentencing power of the court
    to a single term of imprisonment for civil contempt.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    we need not decide whether to apply <em>Re Braun</em> because on this record
    it is distinguishable. Unlike the orders in question in <em>Re Braun</em>,
    the July 16, 2003 order expressly provides for a further period of incarceration
    if the Chiangs continue to refuse to comply with their undertakings. Thus,
    the order itself gives the court the authority to impose an additional penal
    sanction if&nbsp;one is warranted.</p>

    the concern addressed in <em>Re Braun </em><em><span

    in our view, nothing in <em>Re Braun</em> suggests that KDS was required
    to establish a new contempt at the hearing before the trial judge – or that
    the trial judge was hearing a fresh motion for contempt. As she correctly
    noted at para. 33 of her reasons, she was conducting an inquiry into the
    appropriate sanction. A vital consideration on the appropriate sanction was
    whether the Chiangs had purged their contempt by answering their undertakings.</p>

      finding of contempt must be established beyond a reasonable doubt.  That
      finding had already been made in 2003.  The question the trial judge had
      to determine was who had the onus to show compliance with the undertakings,
      and to what standard of proof.  In answering that question the trial judge
      analogized to sentencing in criminal proceedings.  She treated purging
      one’s contempt by showing compliance with an undertaking as equivalent
      to proving a mitigating factor on sentence.  As an accused in a sentencing
      proceeding bears the onus of establishing a mitigating factor on a balance
      of probabilities, she held that the Chiangs, too, had to show on a balance
      of probabilities they had purged their contempt.  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge recognized that little authority existed on this question.  However,
      she drew support from the reasons of Cullity J. in <i>Ryan v. Maljkovich</i>,
      [2001] O.J. No. 1268 (S.C.) and from s. 724(3) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  She
      wrote, at paras. 37-40:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Justice Cullity found that
      on its motion, the plaintiff had the onus of proving the defendant’s contempt
      beyond a reasonable doubt.  With respect to the defendant’s cross-motion,
      however, he stated:</span></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>For the purpose of purging the contempt pursuant
    to paragraph 8 of the judgment of Juriansz J., the defendant must have shown
    that he has complied with – among other things – the orders made by the learned
    judge with respect to an itemized list of assets and the transfer of available
    funds from abroad.  No authorities were cited on the question of the onus
    or standard of proof for this purpose but compliance must, I believe, be
    demonstrated by the defendant on at least a balance of probabilities.  [Footnote
    omitted.]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Because purging contempt is a mitigating factor,
    the onus and standard of proof used for mitigating factors under the sentencing
    provisions of the <i>Criminal Code</i> can be of some guidance.  This court
    has drawn from sentencing principles found in the <i>Criminal Code</i> when
    sentencing for civil contempt.  For example, in <i>Sussex Group Ltd. v. 3933938
    Canada Inc.</i>, Mr. Justice Cumming relied on the provisions under the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> that govern the imposition of conditional sentences to fashion an
    appropriate remedy under Rule 60.11(5)(f).   [Footnotes omitted.]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Section 724(3) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> provides
    for the resolution of “disputed facts” in a sentencing hearing.  Of particular
    relevance are subsections (b) and (d):</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>724(3) Where there is a dispute with respect
    to any fact that is relevant to the determination of a sentence …</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(b) the party wishing to rely on a relevant
    fact, including a fact contained in a presentence report, has the burden
    of proving it …</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(d) subject to paragraph (e), the court must
    be satisfied on a balance of probabilities of the existence of the disputed
    fact before relying on it in determining the sentence; and</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(e) the prosecutor must establish, by proof
    beyond a reasonable doubt, the existence of any aggravating fact or any previous
    conviction by the offender.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In addition to the clear language of section 724(3),
    judicial consideration of the above provisions confirms that a defendant
    has the onus to prove mitigating factors on a balance of probabilities.  Further,
    it seems wrong that contemnors could require the victims of their contempt
    to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that they have not complied with their
    undertakings.  This would not only require the plaintiffs to prove a negative,
    but it would tend to discourage contemnors from complying with their undertakings.  [Footnote

    that were in issue at the trial, and therefore had not purged their contempt.  The
    Chiangs submit that she erred in this finding.  Alternatively, they seek
    leave to introduce fresh evidence to show that they have now complied with

    the time of the hearing before the trial judge, the Chiangs still had not
    fulfilled six of their original seventeen undertakings.  These, however,
    were the critical undertakings because they focused on the two most important
    aspects of the Chiangs’ unexplained conduct: the disappearance of approximately
    $4.6 million from the telecom business that Jay Chiang controlled, and the
    whereabouts of between $8 million to $10 million that the Chiangs had sent
    to their family members in

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Chiang described the telecom business as a business that “moves voice traffic” between
    North America and the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Far East, and sells that capacity to telephone companies.  It was operated
    through two companies.  The trial judge found that Jay Chiang was
    “the controlling mind and effective owner of the companies.”  In 2000, his
    interest in the telecom business was worth between $7.1 million and $12.1
    million.  The Chiangs do not challenge these findings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Undertaking

    in connection with the telecom business:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Provide to the plaintiffs full disclosure in regard
    to the telecom business (as defined in the Mendlowitz affidavit affirmed
    June 12, 2002), including:</p>

    owned, and all other documents;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b)       Tracing the whereabouts,
    from the date of removal up until today, of all money removed out of the
    ordinary course of the telecom business, including the $2.12 million USD
    removed from the Asia Pacific Gateway account, consisting of the transfer
    of $720,000 USD to Y.C. Chiang on November 9, 1999, $900,000 USD to Tsai
    Chen Cheng Yueh on June 30, 2000 and $500,000 USD to Suzie Wu on April 7,

    the <i>Anton Pillar</i> order permitting KDS to search the Chiangs’ house,
    KDS discovered that Jay Chiang had been operating his telecom business since
    approximately 1996.  The trial judge extensively reviewed the Chiangs’ supposed
    efforts to comply with undertaking 14.  She concluded that they had not complied.  In
    support of that conclusion, she made these strong findings, which we quote
    verbatim:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.

style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Chiangs’ responses and production of documents with respect to the telecom
    business and alleged efforts in that regard are completely inadequate.  They
    are nothing more than an appearance of compliance and are not <i>bona fide</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    second part of this undertaking, 14(b), required the tracing of the whereabouts
    of all money removed out of the ordinary course of the telecom business [over
    $6.7 million] … With one exception, it is not disputed that no information
    has been provided as to what happened with any of these sums.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span

    became of it.  He did not do this.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Perhaps
    the most egregious example [of non-compliance] is the telecom business.  Mr.
    Chiang was able to make an apparently successful multi-million dollar business
    disappear overnight by transferring its considerable assets into accounts
    in the names of family members and related parties.  I believe that they
    continue to hold these assets somewhere for the benefit of Jay and Christina
    Chiang.</p>

    support their obviously lavish lifestyle.  Undertakings 7 and 13 provide
    that the Chiangs must:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Co-operate fully to provide absolute and complete
    detail and documentation of all assets in the names of family members and
    related entitles that the undersigned know about, whether the undersigned

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    undertakings must be read in conjunction with para. 4 of the consent order
    of July 16, 2003 and undertaking 17, each of which required the Chiangs to “use
    all reasonable means necessary to compel their family members to assist them” in
    complying with their undertakings.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>4.         THIS COURT ORDERS THAT Jay Chiang and
    Christina Chiang are to use all reasonable means necessary to compel their

    Christina Chiang in complying with the attached undertakings.  This Court
    requests the assistance of all courts with jurisdiction over Jay Chiang and
    Christina Chiang and their family members and related entities to assist
    Jay Chiang and Christina Chiang in complying with their obligations hereunder.  This
    Court stands ready to reciprocate in full.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>17.       The undersigned acknowledged that this
    Court has expressed its expectation that our family members will provide
    their full co-operation in assisting us in complying with the above undertakings.  We
    intend to use all reasonable means necessary to compel our family members

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Chiangs contend that they have complied with undertakings 7 and 13 to the
    best of their ability – in effect they have used their best efforts – but
    that their family refuses to cooperate with them.  The trial judge flatly
    rejected this contention.  At para. 148 of her reasons she said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Throughout this lengthy proceeding, Mr. and Mrs.
    Chiang have selectively disclosed information so as to give the appearance
    of compliance with the undertakings and then relied on the supposed lack
    of family cooperation to explain their inability to go further.  They have
    not provided any credible or admissible evidence to support this position.  Their
    assertion that family members refuse to cooperate is designed to conceal
    their dishonest conduct.  It is clear that they control and direct the actions
    of their family and the accounts in the names of family members and others
    and could disclose the whereabouts of the millions of dollars if they so
    chose.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Chiangs submit that the trial judge’s rejection of their position reflects
    two legal errors: first, the trial judge misinterpreted the Chiangs’ obligation
    under the term of the July 16, 2003 order by turning an obligation to use
    reasonable means into an unequivocal obligation to disclose; second, the
    trial judge wrongly equated her rejection of the Chiangs’ evidence with proof
    of their control over the members of their family.  We do not accept either
    submission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the Chiangs’ first submission we agree with the trial judge.  As she pointed
    out, the context in which the Chiangs gave the undertaking shows that they
    unequivocally agreed to disclose their assets and, in doing so, fully expected
    their family to cooperate.  In the words of the trial judge, the “excuses
    of the past will no longer be accepted”.  Failing all else, the Chiangs were
    obliged to take court proceedings to compel members of their family to assist
    them, which they have never done.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    the nature of an undertaking supports the trial judge’s view of the Chiangs’ obligation.  Typically,
    an undertaking is a promise given by a party or his counsel to the court
    in the course of legal proceedings as a condition of obtaining a concession
    from the court or the opposite party.  Here the Chiangs gave these undertakings
    in order to avoid imprisonment or another sanction for their admitted contempt.  When
    a party gives an undertaking to the court, that party implicitly represents
    to the court that it is able to fulfill its undertaking.  Both the court
    and the opposite party are entitled to rely on that implicit representation:
    see <i>642947 Ontario Ltd. v. Fleischer</i> (2001), 56 O.R. (3d) 417 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    this representation gains added force when the undertaking obliges the party
    giving it to obtain information from close family members.  As Doherty J.A.
    said on the second stay motion before him:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The appellant continues to operate as though he
    has no control over his family members, particularly his parents.  He wants
    the court to accept that premise.  I do not.  Lax J. made very strong factual
    findings to the contrary.  In my view, steps to obtain the necessary information
    which may support a finding of compliance if a party was at arms’ length
    cannot do so in a case like his where [there] is a close family personal
    and financial connection.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    entirely agree with Doherty J.A.’s observations.  Especially in the context
    of the admittedly close relationship between the Chiangs and their family,
    these undertakings were not best efforts undertakings; they were undertakings
    that unequivocally required the Chiangs to declare the whereabouts of the
    assets they sent to their family members in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    California and
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Chiangs’ relationship with their family, especially their parents, undermines
    their second submission: that the trial judge turned her rejection of their
    evidence into positive proof that they had control over their family.  Had
    the trial judge done that, she may well have been in error: see <i>R. v.
    Coutts</i> (1998), 126 C.C.C. (3d) 545 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place

      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), leave to appeal to S.C.C. dismissed, [1998] S.C.C.A. No. 450.  However,
    in our view, she did not do so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s conclusion that the Chiangs directly controlled the actions
    of their family is supported by a large body of evidence.  All of this evidence
    is unchallenged, and all of it has at its core the very close relationship
    that exists between the Chiangs and their family.  This body of evidence
    includes the following:</p>

    relationship with their parents.  Indeed, over the two year period leading

    son-in-law to fund their living and legal expenses.  The Chiangs’ parents
    paid over $300,000 for the education of the Chiang children.  Jay Chiang’s

    we have said, the critical undertakings relate to the disappearance of the

    Hong Kong law firm.  KDS already had the documents in this file.  Moreover,
    most if not all of the documents were before Doherty J.A. on the second stay
    motion.  He found that the production of these documents did not amount to
    meaningful compliance with the Chiangs’ undertaking 14 “to provide a full
    disclosure in regard to the telecom business”.  We agree.  These documents
    would not have affected the result at trial.</p>

    their proposed evidence, the Chiangs seek to show efforts to compel their
    family members to disclose the whereabouts of the assets sent to them.  Yet
    the evidence shows that their efforts are pitiful or non-existent.  Since
    the order of the trial judge the Chiangs have not examined a single family
    member.  They took perfunctory steps to examine one member of the family
    and then abandoned the effort.  Undoubtedly most of the information about
    the whereabouts of the assets in the hands of the family members lies within
    the Chiangs’ own knowledge.  Tellingly, however, neither Jay nor Christina
    Chiang has filed an affidavit in support of the fresh evidence motion.  </p>

  <h3>Issue 4: Did the trial judge err in sentencing Mr. Chiang to one year imprisonment
    and Mrs. Chiang to eight months imprisonment?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    submission has two branches: the Chiangs contend that the trial judge was
    not entitled to exceed the sentence of seven days imprisonment the parties
    agreed to in the consent order of Farley J. dated July 16, 2003.  Alternatively,
    the Chiangs contend that even if the trial judge was entitled to impose sentences
    greater than seven days, the sentences that she did impose – one year for
    Mr. Chiang and eight months for Mrs. Chiang – are excessive.  We will deal
    with the Chiangs’ second contention first.</p>
  <h3>(1)       If the trial judge was entitled to impose sentences greater than
    seven days, are the sentences that she imposed excessive?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge concluded that she was not confined to the sanction the parties
    agreed to in 2003.  Instead, she concluded that she was entitled to impose
    a sanction appropriate to the circumstances existing at the time of the hearing
    before her.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Assuming
    that she was right in that conclusion, we see no reviewable error in the
    sentences the trial judge did impose.  Indeed, although sentencing is an
    exercise of judicial discretion and, therefore, a sentence imposed by the
    trial judge is entitled to deference from an appellate court, we need not
    rely on the principle of deference.  But for the order of July 16, 2003,
    these sentences of one year for Mr. Chiang and eight months for Mrs. Chiang
    are entirely fit.  In saying this, we can do no better than quote from the
    reasons of the trial judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge recognized that a sentence for civil contempt like any sentence “must
    be proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility
    of the offender.”  The Chiangs are in their forties.  Their conduct is not
    the product of “youthful exuberance”.  They bear full responsibility for
    what they have done.  And, in the trial judge’s view, the gravity of the
    Chiangs’ contempt has been “significant”.  She summarized her view of their
    conduct at para. 38 of her reasons on sentence:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Mr. and Mrs. Chiang have repeatedly breached and
    frustrated the court orders.  They have consistently undermined the objectives
    of the order in order to shield their assets.  Their contempt is blatant,
    deliberate, wilful, and as I will come to, unrepentant.  The gravity of their
    conduct is compounded by the repeated acts of contempt and the large number
    of orders breached, which have had serious adverse and prejudicial consequences
    for the plaintiffs and has impaired the dignity and integrity of the justice
    system.  The gravity of their offence is significant.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>We agree with this paragraph of
    her reasons. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge also recognized that both an apology and a guilty plea can be
    mitigating factors on sentence.  However, she considered neither to be a
    mitigating factor in this case.  Again, we agree with her.  She correctly
    characterized the Chiangs’ apology as “hollow and insincere”, and she fairly
    viewed their 2003 consent to a finding of contempt not as an act of contrition
    but as purely “tactical”.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[42]     In my view, this is a case where the consent
    to the finding of contempt cannot be seen as an act of contrition and must
    be seen as one where the plaintiffs acquiesced due to the overwhelming evidence
    of their dishonesty that demonstrated, among other things, that they had
    lied during examinations, sworn false affidavits, transferred large sums
    of money from their accounts, provided no meaningful disclosure, dissipated
    assets by gambling, by unauthorized use of credit cards for travel, and by
    removal of the contents of safety deposit boxes.  They were clearly in contravention
    of the six court orders.  The finding of contempt was inevitable and their
    consent was purely tactical.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Weighed
    against the absence of any mitigating factors, the trial judge listed an
    array of aggravating factors:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[45]     I have already discussed some of the aggravating
    factors in this case in considering the gravity of the offence.  They include
    the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a)       There was a deliberate course of conduct
    over a lengthy period of time.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b)       There were numerous breaches of six court
    orders.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(c)       The Chiangs were found in contempt of
    fresh orders made while the contempt motion was pending.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(d)       The Chiangs have benefited financially
    from their contempt and have caused extreme prejudice to the plaintiffs.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(e)       The Chiangs have shown disrespect to
    the court by lying to it, offering an insincere apology, and giving only
    the appearance of complying with the courts’
    orders.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(f)        The Chiangs have been given numerous
    opportunities and a lengthy period of time to demonstrate their obedience
    to court orders, but continue to act in breach of the courts’ orders.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(g)       The Chiangs have continued with a lifestyle
    of relative luxury and comfort in spite of and in defiance of orders that
    restrict the use of their assets.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Each
    of these aggravating factors is fully supported by the record.  Together
    they demonstrate, in the trial judge’s words, “a long and woeful record of
    deliberate disobedience to the court”.  The Chiangs’ disobedience
    – their wilful disobedience – has left the court and KDS without any explanation
    for what happened to the $4.6 million gone from the telecom business or the
    $8 million to $10 million siphoned off to family members.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Custodial
    sentences for civil contempt are rare.  Lengthy custodial sentence are even
    rarer.  Canadian courts have tended to punish contempt of court leniently.  Ordinarily
    the mere conviction for contempt together with a modest fine suffices to
    obtain compliance and protect the court’s authority.  Ordinarily incarceration
    is a sanction of last resort: see Robert J. Sharpe, <i>Injunctions and Specific
    Performance</i>, 3d. ed. (
    <st1:City w:st="on">

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the trial judge’s view, however, the Chiangs’
    contempt was not deserving of leniency.  Both to denounce their actions and
    to deter others by showing that the court will not tolerate this kind of
    conduct, the trial judge concluded that lengthy periods of incarceration
    were required.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[48]     This is not a case deserving of leniency.  There
    are no mitigating factors.  There has been no genuine apology and no compliance.  The
    contempt has not been purged.  The conduct of Mr. and Mrs. Chiang must have
    concrete consequences in order to ‘repair the depreciation of the authority
    of the court’ and to send a message to litigants and the public that this
    kind of conduct will not be tolerated.  Undertakings given to a court are
    to be fulfilled; apologies tendered to a court are to be genuinely remorseful;
    court orders are to be obeyed in every respect.  Mr. and Mrs. Chiang have
    made a mockery of the system of justice.  The prospect of a short period
    of incarceration did not deter them in 2003.  The strong and denouncing language
    of the court and the prospect of a lengthier period of incarceration did
    not deter them in 2005.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But
    for the terms of the July 16, 2003 consent order and the 2005 proceeding
    before Farley J., we would agree with the trial judge and with the sentences
    that she imposed.</p>
  <h3>(2)       Was the trial judge entitled to impose sentences greater than
    seven days?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge delivered three excellent and persuasive sets of reasons.  We
    entirely agree with all of her reasons, save on this one issue.  Our disagreement
    has its roots in the terms of the July 16, 2003 order and the court’s failure
    to amend that order in 2005.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    July 16, 2003 order was a consent order.  In para. 1 of that order the court
    found both Jay and Christina Chiang in contempt of six previous court orders.  In
    para. 2 the court ordered that the Chiangs be given the opportunity to purge
    their contempt by apologizing to the court and fulfilling the undertakings
    they gave.  Paragraph 3 of the consent order addressed the court’s sanction
    if the Chiangs failed to fulfill their undertakings.  Its terms are instructive.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3.         THIS COURT ORDERS THAT</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a)       failing the fulfillment of each of the
    undertakings within 90 days hereof, each of Jay Chiang and Christina Chiang
    shall be incarcerated for a period of seven days, to be served consecutively,
    beginning with Jay Chiang, followed by Christina Chiang.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b)       If there is a finding that the undertakings
    have not been fulfilled, then after the above incarceration, Jay Chiang and
    Christina Chiang will have a further period of time in which to purge their
    continuing contempt (the length of such additional time to be then determined
    at a further hearing).</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(c)       If this Court then finds that Jay Chiang
    and/or Christina Chiang have still not purged their contempt by the conclusion
    of the additional time referred to in paragraph 3(b) above, then they may
    be incarcerated for a further period or time, if same is then warranted,
    as determined at that further hearing. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    short, para. 3 contemplates that failing compliance within 90 days, the Chiangs
    will each be incarcerated for seven days.  Only if they have first served
    a seven-day sentence and still have not complied with their undertakings,
    will they face a longer period of incarceration.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Chiangs did not fulfill their undertakings within 90 days.  Indeed, on May
    13, 2005, nearly two years after the consent order, Farley J. found that
    the Chiangs still largely had not purged their contempt.  Yet, he did not,
    as contemplated by para. 3(a) of the July 16, 2003 order, incarcerate the
    Chiangs for seven days.  Instead, he gave them a further 90 days to comply.  In
    doing so he did warn them that they could not expect similar treatment in
    the future and that he would deal with their continued failure to fulfill
    their undertakings “severely”.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>With respect to the sincerity of apologies, I trust
    that the apology was sincere but the proof of that will be in the eating
    of the pudding, not in their words.  And if I determine later that there
    is no effective compliance with purging of the contempt or the fulfillment
    of the undertakings in any way then I would have to assume that the apologies
    were insincere, hollow, and in fact making a mockery of the system of justice.  And
    therefore would have to be severely dealt with.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Still,
    Farley J. did not amend the terms of the July 16, 2003 order or issue a new
    order signalling to the Chiangs that they could face a period of incarceration
    greater than seven days.  In saying this we intend no criticism of Farley
    J.  He was trying to coerce compliance, and hoped that he could do so by
    giving the Chiangs both more time and a strong warning.  Regrettably, his
    “carrot and stick” approach failed to achieve its purpose.  Thus, another
    two years later, when the hearing came on before the trial judge, the Chiangs
    still had not purged their contempt.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge quite properly concluded that the Chiangs’ continued refusal
    to fulfill their undertakings merited jail sentences.  But, in sentencing
    the Chiangs to imprisonment for the first time, the trial judge was faced
    with the argument that she was limited by para. 3(a) of the July 16, 2003
    order to a seven-day sentence.  She rejected this argument.  In the trial
    judge’s view, in 2005, by his “carrot and stick” approach, Farley J. effectively
    varied the 2003 consent order.  She wrote at para. 11 of her reasons on sentence:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The underlying premise of the 2003 order, which
    was carefully crafted, was: (a) to encourage the Chiangs through fulfillment
    of the undertakings to purge their contempt; and (b) to coerce them through
    the prospect of incarceration if they did not.  In submissions, Mr. Blumenfeld
    characterized what Mr. Justice Farley did in 2005 as a “carrot and stick” approach.  This
    is an apt characterization.  He extended the time for the Chiangs to answer
    the undertakings by a further 90 days but he also gave the Chiangs a stern
    warning in the event of continued non-compliance.  In effect, he varied paragraph
    3 of the order by balancing the 90-day extension with a potentially more
    serious period of incarceration than the initial seven days in the order,
    thereby reopening the remedy that the court could grant in a future hearing.  This
    was quite clearly Mr. Justice Farley’s intent ….</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    the trial judge said that having obtained a further extension to answer their
    undertakings, the Chiangs could not claim that she was limited by the terms
    of the 2003 order.  Rule 60.11(5)(a) of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i> gave
    her the discretion to imprison a contemnor “for such period and on such terms
    as are just”.  Thus, she concluded that “[t]he court is not deprived now
    of the ability to impose a sanction that is appropriate to the circumstances” of
    the case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Respectfully,
    we do not agree.  In our opinion the trial judge was bound by the terms of
    the order the parties agreed to and the court approved on July 16, 2003.  As
    we have said, that order was made on consent.  KDS agreed, and the court
    agreed, that the first sentence of imprisonment the Chiangs would serve for
    failing to fulfill their undertakings would be seven days.  Although Farley
    J. could have varied that term in 2005, he did not do so.  We do not view
    his stern warning of severe consequences to amount to a variation of the
    consent order.  He did not imprison the Chiangs at that time, even though
    their non-compliance had extended well beyond 90 days, indeed for nearly
    two years.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Put
    differently, we think it appropriate to ask whether in 2007 the Chiangs were
    on fair notice that for their continued non-compliance they faced a term
    of imprisonment greater than seven days.  We do not think that they were.  Paragraph
    (c) of the July 16, 2003 order contemplated a sentence beyond seven days
    only after the Chiangs had first served a seven-day sentence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    we set aside the sentence imposed by the trial judge and substitute a sentence
    of seven days imprisonment for each of Jay Chiang and Christina Chiang.  In
    addition, Jay Chiang is entitled to a declaration that he has served this
    sentence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Chiangs, however, should not view our order in any sense as a victory.  Their
    undertakings remain unfulfilled.  Their contempt of court remains shocking
    and disgraceful.  They remain under the supervision of the court.  The terms
    of para. 3(a) of the July 16, 2003 have now been satisfied for Jay Chiang.  Should
    the Chiangs’ contempt continue, the Superior Court is free to impose on him
    whatever sentence it considers fit.</p>
  <h3>Issue 5: Did the trial judge err in concluding that the Parole Board did
    not have jurisdiction to grant parole to Jay Chiang?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    will address this issue together with issue 6, because the two issues are
    interrelated.</p>
  <h3>Issue 6: Did the trial judge err in issuing a replacement warrant of committal?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    two issues arise because in July 2007, the Ontario Earned Release and Parole
    Board granted parole to Jay Chiang.  Parole was to begin on September 13,
    2007, four months after the trial judge had sentenced Jay Chiang to one year
    imprisonment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>KDS
    immediately brought an application before the trial judge seeking two things:
    an order quashing the decision of the Parole Board for lack of jurisdiction,
    and a replacement warrant of committal specifying that on his release from
    custody Jay Chiang was to return to court to appear before the trial judge.  The
    trial judge both granted the order and issued a replacement warrant.  The
    Chiangs submit that she erred in doing so.  They also submit that the trial
    judge’s decision even to hear KDS’s application raised a reasonable apprehension
    of bias.  The allegation of bias is groundless and we do not propose to consider
    it further.  </p>
  <h3>(1)       Did the Parole Board have jurisdiction to grant parole to Jay
    Chiang?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Parole Board is created under the <i>Ministry of Correctional Services Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. M.22 (MCSA).  Its decisions are protected by a strong privative
    clause in s. 36 of the MCSA:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Board has exclusive jurisdiction to examine
    into, hear and determine all matters and questions arising under this Part
    and as to any matter or thing in respect of which any power, authority or
    discretion is conferred upon the Board, and the action or decision of the
    Board thereon is final and conclusive and is not open to question or review
    in any court and no proceedings by or before the Board shall be restrained
    by injunction, prohibition or other process or proceeding in any court or
    be removable by application under judicial review or otherwise into any court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless,
    where the Board acts without jurisdiction, its decisions are reviewable.  That,
    in our opinion, is the case here.  In fairness to the Board, we point out
    that when it released Mr. Chiang on parole it did not have the trial judge’s
    reasons on sentence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Parole
    for inmates – those serving a sentence in custody – is statutorily authorized
    under the federal <i>Corrections and Conditional Release Act</i>, S.C. 1992,
    c. 20 (CCRA) and the MCSA.  Under these complementary statutory regimes,
    a provincial parole board has no jurisdiction to grant parole to a person
    serving a custodial sentence for civil contempt of court if the sentence
    includes a requirement that the offender return to court.</p>
  <h3>(a)       The federal regime</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    112(1) of the CCRA gives provincial parole board legislative authority to
    grant parole. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>… a provincial parole board for a province shall
    exercise jurisdiction in accordance with this Part in respect of the parole
    of offenders serving sentences in provincial correctional facilities in that
    province …</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Ontario Earned Release and Parole Board is a
    “provincial parole board”, and Jay Chiang was serving his sentence in a provincial
    correctional facility.  However, to be eligible for parole, he must be an “offender”,
    and
    “offender” is a defined term.  Section 99(1) of the CCRA states in part:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>“offender” means</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a) a person … who is under a sentence imposed
    before or after the coming into force of this section …</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(ii) on conviction for criminal or civil contempt
    of court if the sentence does not include a requirement that the offender
    return to that court …</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[112]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    because Jay Chiang was convicted of civil contempt of court, under the federal
    statutory regime he would not be eligible for parole if his sentence included
    a requirement that he return to the Superior Court.  The original warrant
    of committal under which he was sent to custody did not include this requirement.
    Its absence precipitated KDS’s application for a replacement warrant of committal,
    which the trial judge issued.  We will discuss the trial judge’s authority
    to do so after discussing the provincial regime for granting parole.  </p>
  <h3>(b)       The provincial regime</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[113]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    provincial regime achieves the same result as the federal regime, although
    by a different route.  Section 35 of the MCSA authorizes the Parole Board
    to grant parole:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Subject to the regulations, the Board may order
    the release from custody on parole of any inmate convicted of an offence
    under any Act of the Legislature, any Act of the Parliament of Canada, or
    against a municipal by-law upon such conditions as the Board may determine.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[114]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Jay
    Chiang is an “inmate”.  However, to be eligible for parole under this section
    he must be convicted of an “offence” under a provincial or federal statute.  Even
    if civil contempt of court can be considered an “offence” under s. 35 – a
    point we need not decide – it is not a statutory offence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Chiangs submit that civil contempt is an offence under s. 96(1) of
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario’s <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>: “[c]ourts shall administer concurrently
    all rules of equity and the common law.”  We do not agree.  Section 96 does
    not create an offence.  Indeed, civil contempt of court is not codified in
    any statute.  It is a common law offence: see <i>Untied Nurses of Alberta</i>.  Thus,
    although civil contempt bears the imprint of the criminal law, it remains
    outside the ambit of s. 35 of the MCSA.  Accordingly, Jay Chiang is not eligible
    for parole under the provincial statute.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[116]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    the federal and provincial regimes recognize that civil contemnors remain
    under the jurisdiction of the court, not the Parole Board.  The court, not
    the Board, shall determine when a person convicted of civil contempt of court
    is eligible for release from custody: see <i>Turkawski v. 738675 Alberta
    Ltd.</i>, 2006 ABQB 360 (CanLII) (Alta. Q.B.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Removing
    the Board’s jurisdiction to grant parole for civil contempt of court has
    a sound rationale.  It lies in the purposes of sentencing for civil contempt.  One
    purpose is admittedly punishment for a breach of a court order.  But the
    main purpose is coercive: to promote compliance with the court’s orders.  As
    Doherty J.A. said in his endorsement on the first stay motion, “[u]nlike
    a criminal case in which incarceration is imposed exclusively as a punishment
    for prior criminal conduct, Mr. Chiang’s incarceration serves both as a punishment
    and as an incentive to purge his ongoing contempt.”  Parole is at odds with
    this coercive or incentive-based purpose of sentencing for civil contempt:
    see Sharpe, <i>Injunctions and Specific Performance</i> at para. 6.100.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[118]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    statutory regimes, which leave jurisdiction over a civil contemnor with the
    court, dovetail with the wide discretion given the court under rule 60.11
    of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>.  Under rule 60.11(5)(a) “where a
    finding of contempt is made, the judge may order the person in contempt,
    (a) be imprisoned for such period and on such terms as are just”.  And under
    rule 60.11(8) “a judge may discharge, set aside, vary or give directions
    in respect of an order under subrule (5)”.  These rules give to the court
    an ongoing supervisory role over a civil contemnor together with the discretion
    to vary or even discharge a contempt order if the contemnor purges the contempt.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[119]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    legislative provisions that remove the Parole Board’s jurisdiction to grant
    parole to a civil contemnor may be usefully contrasted with the provisions
    conferring on the Board jurisdiction to grant temporary absence permits.  Both
    under s. 7.3(1) of the federal<i> Prison and Reformatories Act</i>, R.S.C.
    1985, c. P-20 and s. 27(1) of the MCSA, any inmate is eligible for a temporary
    absence permit.  Unlike eligibility for parole, eligibility for a temporary
    absence permit is not qualified in any way.  Jay Chiang was therefore eligible
    for a temporary absence permit and was given one to enable him to work.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[120]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the trial judge was correct in concluding that the Board lacked jurisdiction
    to grant Jay Chiang parole.  Because of the definition of “offender” in s.
    99(1) of the CCRA, that conclusion depended, at least in part, on her requiring
    Jay Chiang to return before the court after serving his sentence.  That requirement
    did not appear in the original warrant of committal.  The trial judge added
    it in the replacement warrant that she issued.  The Chiangs submit that she
    erred in doing so.  </p>
  <h3><span>  </span>(2)     Did the trial judge err in issuing a replacement
    warrant of committal?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[121]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    May, 2007, the trial judge signed the original warrant committing Jay Chiang
    to custody.  She used the form typically used for criminal warrants of committal.  That
    form does not contain a provision that the contemnor be brought back before
    the court on release.  The replacement warrant that the trial judge issued
    in September, 2007 ordered all correctional officers “to return Jay Chiang
    to this court to appear before the Honourable Madam Justice Lax upon his
    release from custody”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[122]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Chiangs submit that the trial judge had no jurisdiction to issue a replacement
    warrant.  They contend that by September, 2007 she was <i>functus officio</i> – that
    is, she had performed her function – and that the new warrant improperly
    interfered with the intervening decision of the Parole Board.  KDS submits
    that the trial judge did have jurisdiction to issue a replacement warrant,
    and that she properly exercised her jurisdiction so that the warrant of committal
    would conform to her original intention in sentencing Jay Chiang to one year
    in custody.  We agree with KDS’s submission.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[123]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    issuance of a warrant is an administrative act.  The issuing judge can amend
    the warrant after it has been issued to ensure that it reflects the judge’s
    original intention: see <i>Ewing v. Mission Institution </i>(1994), 92 C.C.C.
    (3d) 484 (B.C.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) and <i>R. v. Malicia</i> (2006), 82 O.R. (3d) 772 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), per MacPherson J.A.  That is all that happened here.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[124]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    her reasons on sentence, the trial judge rejected Mr. Chiang’s request that
    he serve his sentence in the community.  Instead, she sentenced him to one
    year in custody, and importantly for this ground of appeal, directed that
    upon his release he and his wife be brought before her with a view to deciding
    whether Mrs. Chiang should be released earlier.  Obviously, the trial judge
    intended that Mr. Chiang serve his entire sentence in custody, and that once
    he had served his sentence, she would determine whether to make a further
    order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[125]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    accept that it would be inappropriate for a judge to issue a new or replacement
    warrant in order to change the sentence the judge had imposed.  However,
    the replacement warrant issued by the trial judge in this case did not change
    her original sentence, but gave effect to it.  Accordingly, we decline to
    give effect to these grounds of appeal.</p>
