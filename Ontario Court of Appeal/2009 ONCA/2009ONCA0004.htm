    February 19, 2005,<span class=MsoFootnoteReference> </span>the complainant,
    P.L., attended a party at a hotel in celebration of the birthday of her close
    friend, J.H.  In the early morning hours, the complainant left the party
    with Lawrence Garon and another man, Jeff Storrey.  They ended up in her
    hotel room where, according to the complainant, she was sexually assaulted.  The
    allegations include a beer bottles being forced into her vagina causing
    a tear to her cervix.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

    police were called to the scene and the complainant was taken to hospital.  Both
    men were charged with sexual assault, sexual assault with a weapon, and sexual
    assault causing bodily harm.  Garon pleaded not guilty and elected a trial
    before a judge and jury. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

    primary issue at trial was whether the sexual activity was consensual.  It
    was the defence position that P.L. had engaged in consensual sex with the
    two men and then complained of sexual assault to avoid embarrassment after
    being discovered by J.H. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    jury found Garon guilty on all counts.  Counts one and two were stayed pursuant
    to the rule in <i>Kienapple</i>.  Garon was convicted of sexual assault causing
    bodily harm and sentenced to a term of imprisonment of two years less a day,
    followed by 12 months probation. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

    appeals against his conviction on a number of grounds, all alleging that
    the trial judges final instructions to the jury were inadequate.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

    my view, the trial judge failed to properly instruct the jury. 
    For the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal, quash the conviction,
    and direct a new trial.</p>
  <h2>II.        FACTS</h2>
  <h2><i><span style='font-weight:normal'>P.L., the appellant and Storrey go
        to P.L.s hotel room</span></i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    birthday party took place at a hotel in Dryden, Ontario where P.L. and J.H.
    were both employed.  The two young women rented a room at the hotel, room
    202, so they would not have to worry about driving home after the party.  Shortly
    before midnight, P.L., J.H. and several other partygoers left the birthday
    celebration to go to a bar at a nearby hotel.  While they were at the bar,
    the appellant arrived with some friends, including Storrey.  The complainant
    was already acquainted with the appellant through J.H.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    about 2:00 a.m. the complainant and J.H. returned to the meeting room at
    their hotel where the party had been held.  They were joined by several others,
    including the appellant and Storrey.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    complainant testified that the appellant put his arm around her waist and
    invited her to join him and Storrey in a threesome.  The complainant refused
    but the appellant persisted.  She testified that the appellant put his arm
    on her forearm and led her from the meeting room and across the hotel lobby,
    while Storrey followed. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    front desk clerk testified that he saw two men either pulling or helping
    P.L. through the lobby to the stairs.  Each man had one of her arms and she
    was pulling against them.  The complainants manner was described as being semi-limp.  The
    front desk clerk testified that he thought P.L. and the two men were drunk
    and were just joking around.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>P.L.s
    evidence was that the appellant led her to the stairwell and pulled her up
    the stairs by her arm.  She pulled back a couple of times but did not feel
    that she was in any danger.  At the landing between the first two floors
    the appellant grabbed her across the chest from behind and pulled her up
    the stairs.  She said she began to offer more resistance because she was
    getting more worried.    At some point, she protested, saying, Let me go.  Im
    not going with you.  In cross-examination, the complainant explained that
    she did not scream or yell because she did not want to cause a scene if it
    was unnecessary.   It was early in the morning, and she did not want to wake
    up the guests and risk losing her job.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>P.L.
    testified that upon reaching the second floor the appellant pulled her down
    the hall to room 202.  The appellant told her to give him the keys.  When

    her vagina and that one of his hands remained on her chest to hold her down.  She
    may have said a second time that J.H. was coming and the appellant then got
    up and bolted the door.  The complainant pulled up her pants, went into the

    was hesitant to complain because the appellant was well-regarded by J.H.s
    family and had provided J.H.s father with financial assistance. Unable to

    as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The Crowns position is that she did not consent
    to having a beer bottle thrust up her vagina.  The Defences position is
    that, after considering all of the evidence you should have a reasonable
    doubt on that issue.  The accused does not have to prove that [P.L.] consented
    to this sexual activity.  It is up to Crown counsel to satisfy you beyond
    a reasonable doubt that [P.L.] did not consent to this conduct.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Now ordinarily I would embark on a review of all
    of the evidence.  Youve heard the evidence.  Its been a relatively short
    trial.  Its fresh in your minds.  Both counsel have covered it.  Theres

    strongly objected to the charge on the basis that the jury was not adequately
    advised of the defence position.  However, the trial judge refused to re-charge
    the jury noting that both counsel had fully reviewed the evidence and set
    out the positions of the prosecution and defence in their closing submissions.</p>

    appellant repeats his objection before this court, arguing that the trial
    judge erred by failing to review the important parts of the evidence as it
    related to the defence position.  The Crown argues that, while brief, the
    trial judges summary was sufficient to identify what facts and issues were
    relevant to the jury.</p>

      v. The Queen</i>, [1952] 2 S.C.R. 495, at p. 499, the Supreme Court of
      Canada made it clear that the trial judge must fairly and adequately outline
      the parties positions.  Except in rare cases where it is clearly unnecessary
      to do so, the trial judge must review the substantial parts of the evidence
      and give the jury the theory of the defence so that the jury may appreciate
      the value and effect of that evidence.  Counsels closing arguments cannot
      relieve the trial judge of this obligation: see e.g. <i>R. v. MacKinnon</i> (1999),

    do not accept that this was one of those rare cases where the trial judge
    was justified in refusing to outline the parties positions in the charge
    to the jury.  The trial spanned two-weeks during which extensive evidence
    was presented relevant to the central issue of consent.  The jury also faced
    the added complication of having to understand the legal complexities of
    party liability and assess the evidence relevant to that issue.  </p>

    thrust of the defence position was that the complainants evidence was not
    worthy of belief.  There were numerous challenges to her trustworthiness.  For
    example, there were a number of instances where the complainants testimony
    at trial was inconsistent with what she had told police about the alleged
    assault.  Further, although the complainant testified that she was taken
    to her hotel room against her will, she did not yell for help.  She testified
    that she did not tell the appellant that she was staying in room 202. 
    However, the complainant was unable explain how he knew that this was the
    room she had rented.  The complainant maintained that she strongly resisted
    going into the room with the two men, but there was no evidence of a struggle
    in the room.  Additionally, the complainant did not immediately complain
    of the alleged sexual assault to J.H. when she let her into the hotel room,
    even though J.H. was her best friend.  She explained that she was reluctant
    to complain because she was concerned that a complaint about the appellant
    might cause problems for J.H.s family, given that he had assisted them financially. 
    J.H.s father denied that the appellant had ever assisted him financially.  The
    defence alleged that these factors, among others, called the complainants
    credibility into question.  </p>

    judge must review all facts upon which the defence relies.  The test is fairness
    - this courts inquiry is whether the instructions fairly and accurately
    outlined the positions of the parties and alerted the jury to the evidence
    relevant to those positions.  </p>

    was the duty of the trial judge to lay the defence theory before the jury

    the truthfulness of the complainant. What the trial judge did here 
    merely telling the jury that the evidence was fresh in their minds and had
    been reviewed by both counsel  fell far short of meeting that obligation.
    In fact, the trial judges jury instructions were almost identical to the
    instructions that this court found insufficient in <i>R. v. Yadollahi</i> (1987),

    you should bring to bear your common everyday experience in such matters,
    simply exercise good common sense.  You may believe all of the evidence given

    In determining whether to believe a witness, you should consider such things

    and manner while testifying before you; his or her power of recollection;
    any interest, bias or prejudice he or she may have; <i>any inconsistencies

    jury as to the significance of prior inconsistent statements to the issue

    prior inconsistent statements, the trial judge had to do more than merely
    advise, in general terms, that inconsistencies are relevant in the assessment
    of credibility.  The Crown submits that while the instructions in this regard

    must not use the prior inconsistent statements, not adopted as true under
    oath at trial, as evidence of what actually happened.  The failure to give
    this limiting instruction is of particular concern given that the conduct

    be adequately explained.  Uninstructed, the risk of impermissible use remains.</p>

style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>  In <i>R.
      v. Mannion</i>, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 272, the Supreme Court of Canada made it
      clear that failure to warn a jury that an inconsistent statement may be
      used only on the issue of credibility unless the witness has adopted the
      statement as true, is a reversible error.      </p>
  <h2>(3)       The instructions concerning the limited use of evidence of recent
    complaint</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Generally,
    prior consistent statements are inadmissible as self-serving evidence.  In
    this case, the appellant concedes that the fact that P.L. complained to her
    friends, the police, and the hospital personnel about what happened in the
    hotel room, and the timing of those complaints, was admissible to respond
    to the defence counsels suggestion that she would have complained at an
    earlier opportunity if the events had transpired as she had described.  However,
    the appellant argues that the trial judge erred by failing to instruct the
    jury that the evidence of recent complaint could only be used to rebut the
    allegation that P.L. would have complained at an earlier opportunity, and
    that it must not be used as proof of the offences charged.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown contends that a limiting instruction was not necessary in this case
    given that the Crown, in argument, did not invite the jury to rely on the
    complaints for the truth of their contents, and further, the defence wished
    to elicit some of these complaints in order to challenge the complainants
    credibility.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    this court has held that the usual limiting instruction regarding a prior
    consistent statement may not be necessary where the defence itself relies
    upon the prior statement, where it was clear to the jury that the statement
    was not offered as proof of the underlying facts, or where the concern about
    self-corroboration is simply not present (<i>R. v. Demetrius</i> (2003),
    179 C.C.C. (3d) 26, at paras. 21-22), I am of the view that an instruction
    was necessary in the circumstances of this case.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    the Crown did not suggest to the jury that the statements were offered as
    proof of the underlying facts, no one suggested that such an inference was
    impermissible.  Further, given that the defence was an all-out attack on
    the complainants credibility, there was a serious concern that the jury
    may have used the evidence as a form of self-corroboration.  In the circumstances,
    the trial judge was obliged to advise the jury of both the permitted and
    prohibited use that could be made of the prior complaints.    </p>
  <h2>(4)       The instructions concerning the requisite intent for party liability</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the charge to the jury the trial judge said the following:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>One person may be guilty of an offence committed
    by another.  We say that he is a party to the others offence.  A classic
    example is the driver in a hold-up, the person behind the wheel of the car.  The
    other person goes into the shop and does the holding up, but the driver is
    a party to the offence.  Section 21 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> says Everyone
    is a party to an offence who (a) actually commits it or (b) does or omits
    to do anything <i>for the purpose</i> of aiding any other person to commit
    it or (c) abets any person in committing it.  Subsection 2 says where two
    or more persons form an intention in common to carry out an unlawful purpose
    and to assist each other therein and any one of them in carrying out the
    common purpose commits an offence each of them who knew or ought to have
    known that the commission of the offence would be a probable consequence
    of carrying out the common purpose is a party to the offence.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>There is no doubt that the complainant was touched
    sexually by the insertion of the beer bottle into her vagina.  She may also
    have been subjected to fingers in her vagina and to kissing on her breasts.  There
    were only two persons present.  The complainant says that it was Mr. Garon
    who put his fingers in her vagina, kissed her breast and inserted the beer
    bottle into her vagina.  Now, either he did this or he did not do this.  If
    he did not insert the beer bottle, then Mr. Storrey must have inserted the
    beer bottle, because the beer bottle was inserted.  In that case, you should
    consider whether Mr. Garon was a party to the action of Mr. Storrey in inserting
    the beer bottle.  That is, if you conclude that it was not Mr. Garon, but
    was Mr. Storrey. [Emphasis added.] </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>During
    deliberations the jury asked two questions, including the following:  Does
    Mr. Garon have to commit the second and third offence or can he be convicted
    as a party to the offence of another?</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    response, the trial judge stated:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The second question that you pose is, Does Mr.
    Garon have to commit the second or third offence  I presume you mean personally  or
    can he be convicted as a party to the offence of another on these charges?  You
    didnt say on these charges but I assume thats what you mean.  The answer
    simply is yes.  You will look at these other charges, that is the sexual
    assault with a weapon or sexual assault causing bodily harm and if you conclude
    that it was Storrey that caused, that committed those offences, then Mr.
    Garon can only be convicted if he falls within the parameters of section
    21 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, which I have given you in your charge.  Briefly,
    simply, that hes only liable for Storreys offences if he did something
    to assist Storrey in committing those offences.  So he may have assisted,
    lets say, Storrey to commit the sexual assault of the bottle or whatnot
    and I want to warn you, were not talking about Storreys offence of oral
    sex.  That is not before you.  That has nothing to do with this case. 
    Whats before you in this case is the fondling, the alleged fondling of the
    vagina, the alleged kissing of the breasts and the bottle up the vagina.  So
    if, in fact, even if you found that Storrey committed the sexual assault
    and that Mr. Garon assisted him or was a party to his commission of that
    offence, that does not necessarily make Mr. Garon a party to sexual assault
    with a weapon or sexual assault causing bodily harm.  Youll have to look
    at those separately.  Each charge is separate in this regard.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judges failure to properly explain the <i>mens
    rea</i> for party liability and relate the evidence to the issue cannot be
    excused as harmless error.  The Crown argues that the definition provided
    by the trial judge in the jury charge adequately explained that the appellant
    could only be found guilty as a party if he acted for the purpose of aiding
    Storrey in the commission of the sexual assault with a weapon, or sexual
    assault causing bodily harm.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    jury question suggests that the jury may not have been satisfied that the
    appellant was the principal in relation to the charges of sexual assault
    with a weapon and sexual assault causing bodily harm.  This glimpse into
    the jurys thinking opens the door to the possibility that they were confronting
    the problem of the appellants potential liability under s. 21(1)(b) of the <i>Code.</i>  In
    light of the evidence of the appellants consumption of alcohol and that
    there was some evidence underlying the jurys question about party liability,
    it would have been preferable to provide the jury with further instructions
    regarding the <i>mens rea</i> for party liability.  </p>

style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Having
    said this, it is difficult to see how the appellant could have been convicted
    as a party on this record.  As such, I do not find the deficiency in this
    aspect of the jury instructions to constitute a reversible error.    </p>

    In order to determine whether the Crown had proven beyond a reasonable doubt
    the essential elements of sexual assault with a weapon, the jury had to assess
    the credibility of the complainants testimony that she did not consent to
    that particular sexual act.<b> </b>In my view, that assessment was necessary

    summarizing the defence theory, instructing on the use to be made of prior
    inconsistent statements, and failing to provide a limiting instruction about
    the use the jury could make of evidence of recent complaint.  On the facts

    have had the benefit of reading my colleagues reasons in this matter.  While
    I agree that the trial judges charge is deficient in certain respects, I
    have concluded that, with one exception, none of these inadequacies constitutes
    an error of law.  However, in all of the circumstances, I would apply the

    do not need to review the facts of this case, as they have been fully articulated
    in my colleague&rsquo;s well-written reasons. Suffice it to say, this was
    a very strong Crown case. The appellant did not testify in his own defence
    to provide a narrative of events different from that given by the complainant.
    The complainant suffered a serious laceration and bruising injury to her
    cervix, of a kind that the examining physician had never before seen in over
    2,500 pelvic examinations, caused by the strong and rapid thrusting of a
    beer bottle into her vagina. The complainant was clearly traumatized after
    the event. At the scene, the police found the complainant crying and visibly
    upset. When she was taken to hospital, the nurse noted that she appeared &ldquo;shockey&rdquo; and
    very pale, was cold to the touch, and was extremely quiet.</p>
  <h4>Analysis</h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    will address the five issues raised on appeal in the same order as they were
    addressed by my colleague.  Before doing so, however, I wish to make two
    observations. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    I note that, with respect to all but one of the concerns with the trial judges
    charge to the jury addressed by my colleague, no objection was made by defence
    counsel to the charge at trial.  As noted by Moldaver J.A., writing for this
    court, in <i>R. v. Phillips</i> (2001), 154 C.C.C. (3d) 345, at p. 359, the
    failure to object is an indication that counsel was satisfied that the jury
    fully appreciated their role and it serves as a yardstick against which
    to measure the contrary position now advanced for the first time on appeal. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    in my view, several of the appellants bases for challenging the complainants
    credibility have limited significance in the circumstances of this case.  For
    example, although the complainants credibility was called into question
    by defence counsel because there was no sign of struggle in the hotel room
    (other than the pool of blood on the bed) and because she did not yell for
    help nor did she immediately complain of being sexually assaulted, this challenge
    is, to a large degree, premised on the stereotypical assumption that there
    is a normal reaction by victims of sexual assault. 
    This has long ago been discounted by Canadian courts and, in fact, juries
    should generally be cautioned about making such assumptions: see <i>R. v.
    D.(D.)</i>, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 275.</p>
  <h3>1.         Did the trial judge err in refusing to review the evidence and

    issue consists of two separate, albeit inter-related, components: first,
    whether the trial judge failed to adequately advise the jury of the defence
    position; and, second, whether the trial judge should have reviewed the evidence
    presented at trial, including the evidence that cast doubt on the complainants
    credibility, in his charge to the jury.</p>

    the conclusion of his submissions at trial on behalf of the appellant, defence
    counsel summarized the defence position as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In closing then, my respectful submission to you
    is, that based on the evidence youve heard, certainly the evidence of [P.L.]
    and the evidence of the identification officer, the evidence of those witnesses
    called by the defence, in my respectful submission, you just do not find
    yourself in a position of being sure what took place, so as to be able to
    come to a conclusion of guilt on any of these charges.  I suggest to you
    that simply isnt possible on the evidence that youve heard.  I ask you
    to give Mr. Garon the benefit of that doubt and find him not guilty as charged.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    its submissions, the Crown noted that the events unfolded in a hotel room
    that the complainant was sharing with her best friend and involved two men,
    one she did not know and the other she only knew vaguely through a friend.  The
    Crown then focused on the sheer improbability that the complainant, in these
    circumstances, would have consented to having her underwear torn off and
    a beer bottle repeatedly thrust into her vagina.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    his charge to the jury, the trial judge characterized the issue to be determined
    by the jury and the respective positions of the parties as follows: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The issue is whether she consented to the sexual
    activity that forms the basis of this charge.  In particular, did she consent
    to having a beer bottle thrust up her vagina.  The Crowns position is that
    she did not consent to having a beer bottle thrust up her vagina.  The Defences
    position is that, after considering all of the evidence you should have a
    reasonable doubt on that issue.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    the jury retired, defence counsel objected to the charge and requested that
    the trial judge put the defences position in different terms.  Specifically,
    defence counsel asked for its position to be put to the jury as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[T]he quality of [P.L.s] evidence with all of
    the inherent inconsistencies and other frailties Ive pointed out, are such
    that they should have a reasonable doubt.  Thats the defence position.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is clear from this extract from defence counsels closing submissions that
    defence counsel, through its objection to the trial judges charge, wanted
    the trial judge to put its position to the jury with a slightly different
    emphasis, namely, on the complainants inconsistent evidence.  The defences
    attempt to refine its position may well have been a response to the way in
    which the Crown had framed its closing submissions.  In my view, the way
    that the trial judge expressed the defence position was not unfair.  It was,
    however, incomplete and, in light of the aforementioned request by defence
    counsel, the trial judge should have reframed the defence position in the
    manner articulated by defence counsel and, in one or two paragraphs, he ought
    to have related both the defence and Crown positions to the submissions they
    made regarding the complainants credibility.  His failure to do so was an
    error.</p>
  <h3>b)  In his charge to the jury, should the trial judge have undertaken a
    review of the evidence presented at trial, including the evidence which cast
    doubt on the complainants credibility?</h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge failed to adequately review the evidence
    heard at trial and that such evidence was not so straightforward as to relieve
    the trial judge of his duty both to review it and to relate it to the issues
    and to the defence position. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    I have explained, the trial judges failure to reframe the defence position
    and briefly relate the defence and Crown positions to the evidence, in my
    view, constitutes an error.  I do not, however, consider that the failure
    to carry out a broader review of the evidence constitutes an error.  While
    the trial judge did not undertake a stand-alone review of the evidence, he
    did deal with key portions of the evidence in various parts of his charge.  Importantly,
    defence counsel did not object to the trial judges review of the evidence
    nor to his failure to direct the jury to evidence that might cast doubt on
    the complainants truthfulness.  While a somewhat more extensive review of

    I do not consider that his failure to do so constitutes an error.</p>

    duty of the trial judge in a charge is to decant and simplify: <i>R. v.
    Jacquard</i>, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 314, at p. 325.  This was a straightforward
    case.  Accordingly, the charge was adequate to convey to the jury what were
    largely uncontested facts in relation both to the various legal elements
    of the offence of sexual assault and to causation.  Moreover, the trial judge
    described the nature of the complainants injuries and referred to the evidence
    that was led in respect of the appellants good character and the use that
    could be made by the jury of that evidence. </p>

    appeal, the appellant submits that the trial judges failure to relate the
    evidence of inconsistencies in the complaints evidence to the appellants
    position that the jury should be left with a reasonable doubt constitutes
    a reversible error.  The appellant relies on <i>R. v. MacKinnon</i> (1999),
    43 O.R. (3d) 378 (C.A.), to support his argument that it was simply not enough
    for the trial judge to convey to the jury that the evidence, including the
    alleged inconsistencies, had been reviewed at length by defence counsel in
    his closing submissions. </p>

    disagree.  The adequacy of jury instructions in each case depends on the
    specific facts of that case and, accordingly, this court must take a functional
    approach to assessing the adequacy of a trial judges jury charge.  The present
    case is different from <i>MacKinnon</i> in a number of key respects.  In <i>MacKinnon</i>,
    not only was the trial lengthy, but the accused also testified in his own
    defence and denied involvement in the alleged offence.  Further, defence
    counsel objected to the trial judges failure to relate the evidence to the
    defence position and this objection was disregarded by the trial judge.  The
    present case is more analogous to <i>R. v. Ambrose and Hutchison</i>, [1977]
    2 S.C.R. 717, where, at pp. 725  726, Spence J., for a unanimous court,
    stated that: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>If counsel for the defence based the theory of
    the defence upon discrepancies in 1371 printed pages of evidence given by
    Crown witnesses then it was his duty in his address to outline those discrepancies.  The
    learned trial Judge was of the opinion that counsel for the defence had done
    so most adequately and was, therefore, I think, properly of the opinion that
    it was neither necessary nor desirable that he should repeat the outline
    of those discrepancies in his chargeTo have burdened the jury with a recital
    of discrepancies which had already been outlined in the very long and most
    complete address of counsel for the accused would not have served any useful
    purpose and might well have so confused the jury as to detract from their
    efficient discharge of their sworn duty.</p>

    my view, the above comment equally applies to the present case, where defence
    counsel devoted virtually all of the 55 pages of his closing submissions
    to the alleged inconsistencies in the complainants evidence. 
    Further, had the trial judge repeated these alleged inconsistencies in his
    charge to the jury, which, importantly, was given on the same day shortly
    after defence counsels closing submissions, he would then have had to balance
    this review with a review of the evidence referred to by the Crown in support
    of the complainants credibility: see <i>R. v. Batte</i> (2000), 49 O.R.
    (3d) 321,<span

    the present case, the trial was relatively short and the case was neither
    legally nor factually difficult.  Submissions by both defence and Crown counsel
    were made on the same day as the charge and both focused on the issue of
    the complainants credibility.  The only real issue for the jury was the
    application of the proper standard of proof, keeping in mind that the legal
    burden rested with the Crown.  In my view, this was adequately explained
    by the trial judge.</p>
  <h3 style='text-align:justify;'>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did
    the trial err in failing to instruct the jury about the relevance and permitted

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge instructed the jury that, in assessing the credibility of each
    witness, they should take into account, among other things,
    any inconsistencies in his or her testimony.  The trial judge repeated
    this instruction when he later recharged the jury on this issue.  No objection
    was made at trial to this aspect of the charge or the recharge. Given that
    both Crown and defence counsel devoted most of their submissions to addressing
    the alleged inconsistencies in the complainants evidence and the significance
    thereof, I presume that the trial judge and both counsel concluded that the
    jury was acutely aware of the need to consider them in their credibility
    assessment and, accordingly, that no further direction was required from
    the trial judge.  Therefore, on the facts of this case, I do not consider
    that the charge was deficient in this regard. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

    colleague has raised the concern that a limiting instruction ought to have
    been given by the trial judge with respect to the use that could be made
    of prior inconsistent statements.  I do not consider that such an instruction
    was necessary in the circumstances of this case, for a number of reasons.  First,
    the Crown did not ask the jury to rely on the complainants prior inconsistent
    statements.  The prior inconsistent statements were elicited and relied on
    by the defence in an attempt to impeach the complainants credibility.  Second,
    the complainant largely acknowledged her prior inconsistent statements in
    cross-examination and, accordingly, it was only her explanation of the inconsistencies
    that was in issue.  Finally, in my view, a limiting instruction would have
    risked confusing the jury and would have been of dubious benefit.</p>
  <h3>3.      Did the trial judge err in failing to instruct the jury in respect
    of the limited use that could be made of evidence of recent complaint?</h3>

style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant argues that the trial judge erred in failing to instruct the jury
    that evidence of recent complaint could not be used as proof of the offence
    charged.  I do not consider that such an instruction was necessary.  This
    evidence was admissible in order to rebut the defence allegation of recent
    complaint, and the Crown did not invite the jury to rely upon the statements
    for the truth of their contents.  Further, to some extent, these  statements
    were actually relied on by the defence in an attempt to impeach the complainants
    credibility.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    need for a limiting instruction in respect of evidence of recent complaint
    depends on the facts of each case.  In my view, such an instruction was unnecessary
    in this case and, further, its inclusion in the charge ran the risk of confusing
    the jury.  Moreover, a limiting the instruction would, to some extent, also
    have highlighted to the jury just how quickly after the incident and consistently
    the complainant complained of being sexually assaulted, which would only
    have served to assist the Crown to the detriment of the defence.</p>
  <h3>4.      Did the trial judge err in failing to give proper instructions
    to the jury concerning the requisite intent for party liability?</h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    agree with my colleague that the trial judges instruction in this regard
    did not constitute a reversible error. </p>
  <h3>5.      If the trial judge did err by giving inadequate instructions to
    the jury, should the curative proviso be applied?</h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Despite
    the error in the charge, I would nonetheless maintain the conviction because,
    in my view, there was no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice in this
    case.  I reach this conclusion for two reasons. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    I view the errors to be harmless and, on the facts of the case, they would
    have had no impact on the verdict.  When the charge and the submissions of
    counsel are considered together, it is clear to me that the jury was left
    with a proper understanding of both the relevant evidence and the law and
    knew the task with which they had been charged, despite the alleged deficiencies
    in the jury charge raised by the appellant.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)"'>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    this was a very strong Crown case.  Corroboratory evidence was led to support
    the complainants evidence that she was forced up to the hotel room and that
    she was in a visible state of distress following the assault.  It is undisputed
    that the appellant was present when a beer bottle was repeatedly inserted
    into the complainants vagina with considerable force and that the complainant
    suffered a significant injury as a result.  It is simply implausible on the
    facts of this case that the complainant consented to a person virtually unknown
    to her tearing off her underwear and using a beer bottle in this fashion
    while she lay in a room that she shared with her best friend in the hotel
    at which they both worked.  The appellant did not testify and, absent a different
    narrative of events, there is simply no reasonable possibility that, but
    for the inadequacies in the trial judges charge, the jury would or could
    have reached a different verdict.</p>
