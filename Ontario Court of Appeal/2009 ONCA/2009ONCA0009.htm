  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    a decision dated December 3, 2008, this court allowed the appeal and awarded
    costs of the appeal and of the lower court motion to the appellants in the
    amounts of $30,000 and $40,000, respectively.  By letter dated December 9,
    2008, the respondents asked to be permitted to make submissions on the costs
    award saying that the panel had not received submissions from counsel as
    to the appropriateness of costs of the lower court proceeding.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    begin by noting that, in accordance with the court’s practice direction,
    the time to make submissions respecting costs is at the time of the hearing: <i>Practice
    Direction Concerning Civil Appeals in the Court of Appeal </i>(October 7,
    2003).  Indeed, in the present matter, counsel provided costs outlines to
    the panel and addressed certain aspects of that matter.  For example, respondents’ counsel
    took issue with the appellants’ entitlement to costs of the lower court motions
    on the basis that the appellants had not appealed that award.  Further, respondents’ counsel
    also made submissions on the quantum of costs sought by the appellants, as
    it was her view that the amount of time spent by counsel for the appellants
    was excessive.  Counsel for the appellants contended that costs should follow
    the event and, if they were successful, asked to be awarded costs of the
    proceedings below.  Nonetheless, to accommodate the contention of respondents’ counsel
    that she had not been heard on the matter, the panel accepted further submissions.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    respect of the costs awarded for the proceedings below, contrary to the submission
    of the respondents, we do not view the motion judge as refusing to award
    costs to any party solely due to a dearth of law on the subject or because
    of the novelty of the matters in issue.  In our view, despite the respondents’ success
    on the motion, the motion judge chose to exercise his discretion and make
    no award of costs after a consideration of all the circumstances, including:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>(a) the impecuniosity of the appellants;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>(b) the tragic circumstances of the case; and</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>(c) the novelty and importance of the issues raised on the motion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    general, costs follow the event.  The appellants were successful on the appeal,
    and, as a result, also on the lower court motion.  The general principle
    when an appeal is allowed is that the order for costs below is set aside
    and the costs below and of the appeal are awarded to the successful appellant:
    see <i>Hunt v. TD Securities Inc.</i> (2003), 43 C.P.C. (5th) 211 (C.A.),
    at para. 2.  Further, where the substantive disposition is different from
    that of the decision under appeal, leave to appeal costs is not necessary:
    see <i>Dines v.
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Harvey A. Helliwell Investments Ltd.</i>, [1992] O.J. No. 2107 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite
    the novelty of the issues that were decided, we see no reason to depart from
    the general principle.  As the appeal was successful, the circumstances and
    considerations have changed.  The appellants were entirely successful on
    the appeal with the result that they are now permitted to continue their
    actions against the new defendants.  As such, they are entitled to their
    costs both of the motion below and of the appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    wish to comment on an additional matter.  The request to make additional
    submissions focussed on costs of the motion below.  It would have been appropriate
    and preferable had counsels’ submissions been limited to that matter.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the decision to award the appellants costs of the motion and the appeal fixed
    at $40,000 and $30,000, respectively, is affirmed.</p>
