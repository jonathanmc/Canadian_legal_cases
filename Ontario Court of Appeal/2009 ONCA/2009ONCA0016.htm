  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>I. Overview</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The main issue
    on this appeal involves the test to be applied in relation to a request for
    costs against the Ontario Review Board (the “ORB”).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      On December
    18, 2006, the ORB adjourned Mr. Leyshon-Hughes’s annual review hearing of its
    own motion, without hearing any evidence, for the stated purpose of permitting
    the parties to obtain additional evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      In May 2007,
    Mr. Leyshon-Hughes (the “respondent”) applied successfully for an order
    quashing the adjournment order and for a further order directing the ORB to
    convene a new panel to conduct his annual review. After making these orders, de
    Sousa J. ordered the ORB to pay the respondent’s costs of the application, costs
    submissions and aborted annual review hearing. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The issues
    on this appeal relate solely to the costs award. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The ORB
    appeals from the costs order, claiming that the application judge: i) lacked
    jurisdiction to award costs of the aborted annual review hearing; ii) applied
    the wrong test in deciding that costs should be awarded; iii) failed to
    consider relevant factors; iv) reached an unreasonable conclusion; and v)
    misinterpreted and misapplied the decision in <i>R. v. Curragh</i>, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 537. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      In addition
    to contesting the ORB’s submissions, the respondent contends that leave to
    appeal is required and should not be granted on the facts of this case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      For the
    reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal, set aside the costs order and
    substitute an order that there be no order as to costs of the proceedings below
    or before the ORB.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>II.
    Background</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>            i)
    Events leading up to the aborted 2006 annual review hearing</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      On September
    15, 1986, the respondent was found not guilty of first degree murder by reason
    of insanity. The respondent was 15 years old when the index offence took place.
    The victim was a 25-year-old woman who had befriended him and who on occasion
    provided him with a place to stay. Following such an occasion, the respondent
    stabbed the victim 21 times, left her apartment and forged some cheques, and
    then returned to the apartment and engaged in sexual activity with the corpse.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      Senior
    forensic psychiatrists testified at the respondent’s trial that his mental
    state, which they attributed to neonatal brain damage amplified by a
    personality disorder, rendered him incapable of appreciating the nature and
    quality of his acts. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following the verdict, the respondent was detained in
    the maximum security Oak Ridge Division of the Penetanguishene Mental Health
    Centre and became subject to the jurisdiction of the ORB under Part XX.1 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. While detained at
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Oak Ridge, the respondent
    scored 34 on a psychopathy assessment (PCL-R), placing him in a small sub
    group, 100% of which were likely to re-offend violently within seven years. He
    was diagnosed with Personality Disorder, Antisocial and Narcissistic.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On July 8, 1992, the respondent was transferred to the
    medium secure unit of the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Kingston
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Psychiatric Hospital. By 1998
    he had reached a therapeutic impasse--there was no treatment and no treatment
    plan. During his 1999 annual review hearing, the respondent was sent for an
    independent assessment by Dr. John Bradford at the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">
    Royal
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Ottawa
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Hospital. Upon Dr.
    Bradford undertaking to serve as his attending psychiatrist, the respondent was
    transferred to the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Royal
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Ottawa
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Hospital.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Bradford formulated a new diagnosis of Personality
    Deterioration due to Organic Brain Injury. Based on this diagnosis, he excluded
    the previous diagnosis of Personality Disorder and prescribed medication to
    treat the underlying condition, with the result that the respondent began to
    improve. Dr. Bradford’s psychopathy assessment yielded a score of 14; another
    expert’s assessment, which he adopted, yielded a score of 18.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following his transfer to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Ottawa, the respondent made dramatic progress.
    He furthered his education, began living in the community and was able to
    achieve full-time employment. However, despite this progress, as of 2006, the
    respondent remained subject to a conditional discharge order. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The events surrounding the respondent’s 2005 annual
    review bear some relevance to events at the aborted 2006 annual review hearing.
    The respondent was not represented at his 2005 annual hearing. Following the
    hearing but prior to the release of the ORB’s reasons, the Alternate
    Chairperson of the 2005 annual hearing (also the Alternate Chairperson of the
    2006 annual hearing) contacted Dr. Bradford and indicated that he intended to
    review some of the matters raised at the 1999 annual hearing. Dr. Bradford
    informed the respondent of this development. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In its reasons for disposition relating to the 2005
    annual review hearing, the ORB indicated that Dr. Bradford’s evidence, standing
    alone, would have left it with little choice but to grant an absolute discharge
    to the respondent. However, the panel indicated that it had reviewed documents
    dating back to the respondent’s 1999 hearing, including documentation relating
    to the controversy around the respondent’s risk assessments and his release
    into the community when he was transferred to the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">
    Royal
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Ottawa
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Hospital. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In light of this information and a finding that there were
    outstanding questions about the circumstances surrounding the index offence,
    the panel indicated that, in the absence of the continuing support of the
    hospital team, they were not satisfied that the respondent would not succumb to
    “impulsive acts” and “outbursts of aggression”. The panel found that the
    respondent continued to pose a significant threat “based on his history and the
    nature of his psychiatric condition” and continued the conditional discharge
    order with the suggestion that the respondent be represented at the next annual
    review and that counsel have available the ORB’s 1999 reasons for disposition.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Prior to the December 18, 2006 annual review hearing,
    two pre-hearing teleconferences took place. At the initial pre-hearing teleconference,
    Crown counsel indicated he would be asking at the hearing that the respondent’s
    conditional discharge status continue. Crown counsel also stated that he was
    considering asking the ORB to order an independent assessment. In response, Dr.
    Bradford indicated he would expand his 2006 report to respond to the concerns
    raised about the index offence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the second pre-hearing teleconference, Crown counsel
    said it was unlikely that he would request an independent assessment. He
    confirmed this position in writing after receiving Dr. Bradford’s final report.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The ORB member who conducted the pre-hearing
    teleconferences did not participate in the December 18, 2006 annual review
    hearing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>            ii)
    The 2006 Annual Review Hearing</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Prior to commencing the December 18, 2006 annual
    hearing, the ORB panel held an in-camera meeting. Following the meeting, the
    panel indicated it wanted to get another opinion, suggested that the hearing be
    adjourned to permit the parties to do so, and asked for submissions on its
    suggestion. During the course of these submissions, counsel for the respondent
    asked the Alternate Chairperson to recuse himself based on a reasonable
    apprehension of bias. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ultimately, the Alternate Chairperson declined to
    recuse himself and the panel adjourned the hearing for up to six months to
    enable the parties to obtain further evidence. The Alternate Chairperson gave oral
    reasons for this decision, which were accompanied by a handwritten endorsement
    and a promise of more detailed reasons to follow.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge described the oral reasons as
    follows:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="headingNUMBER" style="line-height:normal;">Briefly,
      those reasons expressed the panel’s “concern or discomfort about the
      completeness of the evidence it would like to hear and the fact that the only
      expert medical evidence that it will hear is from Dr. Bradford.” Of equal
      concern to the Board was that Dr. Bradford seemed to be “dismissive of other
      experts’ conclusions and test results without concomitant reconciliation of
      their’s with his own to the satisfaction of the Board.” The Board could not
      ignore the legitimate medical controversy.</p>
    <p class="headingNUMBER" style="line-height:normal;">The
      Board went on to conclude … that it “is suggested, and it would be preferred if
      [the respondent’s] medical history be subject to a qualitative review by
      another expert, less close to [the respondent’s] circumstances and who is not
      part of the diagnostic disagreement and who can simply provide a fresh
      perspective.” While recognizing that it did not have the power to order an
      assessment under s. 672.12(1) [of the Criminal Code], it stated that its
      inquisitorial duties dictated that it seek a broader medical perspective in
      [the respondent’s] case. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The oral reasons concluded as follows:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="headingNUMBER" style="line-height:normal;">In
      anticipation that Dr. Bradford’s evidence reflects the hospital report--which
      we should mark as Exhibit 1 today--and his evidence in prior hearings, this
      Board simply isn’t satisfied that it can have the in-depth analysis that it
      needs to evaluate the accused’s risk.</p>
    <p class="headingNUMBER" style="line-height:normal;">Without
      it this Panel could likely not come to an informed decision about [the
      respondent’s] risk. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The handwritten endorsement indicated the adjournment
    was “to allow the parties to obtain additional evidence, suggested by the Board
    to consist of an independent overview of the accused’s entire history, his
    diagnosis &amp; risk, treatment, and the medical controversy which surrounded these
    factors at the time of the accused’s transfer to Dr. Bradford’s care.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On January 23, 2007, the ORB released its promised
    additional reasons for the adjournment, which also contained a list of nine
    issues for review by any expert chosen by the parties to provide additional
    evidence. As part of that list, the ORB suggested that the expert be asked
    about the possibility of a trial withdrawal of the respondent’s medication to
    “support or refute the organic diagnoses.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>            iii)
    The Respondent’s Application and Request for Costs</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following the ORB’s December 18, 2006 decision to
    adjourn his annual review hearing, the respondent brought an application for <i>habeas corpus</i> with <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i> in aid. The respondent withdrew his request for <i>habeas corpus</i> at the outset of the hearing but proceeded with his
    requests for <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his initial application, the respondent requested
    costs against the Crown. At the opening of the hearing, he withdrew that
    request and substituted a request for costs against the ORB.</p>

    The ORB’s Request to Intervene on the Application</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The ORB was not initially a party to the application. The
    respondent consented to the ORB intervening to address its jurisdiction to make
    the order in issue as well as its practice and procedure in relation to such an
    order but resisted its request to intervene on substantive issues. The
    application judge dismissed the ORB’s motion to intervene in relation to the
    substantive issues. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>            v)
    The Application Judge’s Reasons concerning the Merits of the Application</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge granted the respondent’s request
    for an order for <i>certiorari</i> with <i>mandamus</i> in aid. She concluded that the
    ORB had no statutory jurisdiction to adjourn the respondent’s annual review
    hearing for a period of more than 30 days without the respondent’s consent. In
    addition, although she found, at para. 88, that the ORB “has the statutory
    authority to embark on such a broad scope of inquiry with respect to a NCR
    accused’s past and present medical diagnosis and treatment”, she concluded that
    the ORB made jurisdictional errors by making a premature decision concerning
    the sufficiency of the evidence and by failing to allow the respondent to
    exercise all of his procedural rights concerning the presentation and testing of
    evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Concerning the suggestion that the respondent submit to
    a trial withdrawal of his medications, the application judge said, “there is a
    basis for concluding that the ORB  was
    attempting to do indirectly what it knew it could not do directly.” Finally,
    the application judge concluded that the ORB lost jurisdiction by demonstrating
    a reasonable apprehension of bias in that it had “pre-judged both the evidence
    and the conclusions to be drawn from evidence prior to hearing all of the
    evidence and prior to giving the parties the opportunity of testing the
    evidence.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>III. The
    Application Judge’s Reasons on Costs</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Early in her reasons on costs, the application judge
    noted that “the inherent jurisdiction of this Court to award costs in favour of
    and against any party and the Intervener was not contested and in fact was
    positively acknowledged.” Soon thereafter, she commented on the usual rule that
    costs follow the event unless there is some reason for the court not to
    exercise its discretion in that way. She concluded that because the ORB is a
    “unique tribunal” with a “significant public mandate”, success could not be the
    determinative factor in awarding costs in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge accepted the respondent’s
    submission that the jurisprudence dealing with costs against the Crown has no
    application to this case and stated, “[o]f more relevance is the jurisprudence
    dealing with costs awards made by courts against administrative tribunals or
    quasi-judicial tribunals and interveners.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although she found that the ORB overreached on its
    intervener motion, the application judge rejected the respondent’s request for
    costs of that motion, holding that some participation by the ORB was necessary
    and taking account of the fact that it may have been the first time the ORB was
    involved in litigation relating to the substantive issues. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge granted the respondent costs on a
    partial indemnity basis with respect to the application, the aborted annual
    review hearing and the costs submissions. In doing so, the application judge
    accepted the ORB’s submission that “in matters where administrative or
    quasi-judicial tribunals are concerned costs do not necessarily follow the
    event.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, she said, “the jurisprudence is equally clear
    that the Court reserves the right to exercise its discretion to award costs
    against a tribunal in the face of tribunal misconduct to the detriment of an
    individual before it or where the tribunal has conducted itself in such a way
    as to call for strong disapproval.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge found both factors applicable in
    this case. She said the ORB exceeded its jurisdiction by “denying [the
    respondent] procedural fairness and natural justice and by having an
    apprehension of bias.” She found prejudice to the respondent in the form of the
    costs of the aborted annual review hearing, the application and the new annual
    review hearing that would be required. She said, “[s]uch a result cannot be
    condoned nor remain without a concrete remedy. It justifies, if not calls out
    for, the application of the compensatory function of a costs award.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, although she rejected the respondent’s request
    for full indemnity costs, likening this case to <i>Curragh</i>, the application judge concluded a partial indemnity costs
    order was appropriate. She said:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="headingNUMBER" style="line-height:normal;">While
      the details of the facts differ, I find the circumstances of this case very
      comparable to the circumstances found in the case of <i>R. v. Curragh Inc.</i> [citation omitted] where the Supreme Court of
      Canada in concluding that the Court acted with an obvious apprehension of bias
      towards the accused stated as follows: </p>
    <p class="headingNUMBER" style="line-height:normal;">…The
      appellants have suffered and will continue to suffer from the grievous
      financial burden of legal costs. Ordinarily this is something which must be
      accepted by those charged with criminal offences. Yet, in this case the delays
      and much of the legal costs incurred arise from systemic problems that were
      beyond the control of the appellants. They were to a large extent occasioned by
      the words and actions of the trial judge which gave rise to an apprehension of
      bias. This was followed by his refusal to grant the motion for recusal. In
      these unique circumstances the appellants should recover their reasonable legal
      costs of the proceedings to date. As well they should be paid the reasonable
      legal costs incurred in the new trial for which they cannot in any way be held
      responsible.</p>
    <p class="headingNUMBER" style="line-height:normal;">Counsel
      for [the respondent] has requested that costs be awarded on a solicitor-client
      scale which effectively amounts to full indemnity of costs. The threshold test
      for an award of such scale of costs is a high one set by the Supreme Court of
      Canada in <i>Baker v. Canada (Minister of
        Citizenship and Immigration</i>) [citation omitted]. It is the level of costs
      awarded where the conduct in question is found to be “reprehensible, scandalous
      or outrageous” on the part of one of the parties.</p>
    <p class="headingNUMBER" style="line-height:normal;">Taken
      in isolation, the conduct of the Ontario Review Board may be considered in such
      a way. However, one must put the issues before the Court and the Ontario Review
      Board hearing in its proper context. <i>This
        was the first time this question has arisen for the
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      <st1:State
 w:st="on">
      Ontario Review Board.</i> As I indicated in
      my reasons of May 31, 2007, the jurisprudence indicates that the duty of
      procedural fairness when it comes to tribunals is not absolute but must
      necessarily be flexible and variable depending on the purpose and an
      appreciation of the governing statute in question. [Citations omitted.] <i>While it acted erroneously and while it was
        misguided in its actions, the
      <st1:State w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Ontario
      Review Board did not act maliciously. In light of that finding I am not
      prepared to find that the Board has crossed that high threshold of misconduct
      which would justify an award of costs on a full indemnity basis. </i>This does
      not however, exonerate it from paying any costs to [the respondent] for the
      prejudice suffered by him. [Emphasis added.]</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent submits that leave to appeal is required
    under s. 676.1 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.
    Section 676.1 is in Part XXI of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>, dealing with appeals involving indictable offences. It states:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="headingNUMBER" style="line-height:normal;">676.1
      A party who is ordered to pay costs may, with leave of the court of appeal or a
      judge of a court of appeal, appeal the order or the amount of costs ordered. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Relying on the discretionary nature of a costs order,
    the respondent contends there is no basis for granting leave. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The ORB contends that since the underlying proceeding
    was an application for an extraordinary remedy, Part XXVI of the <i>Criminal Code</i> applies, and leave to
    appeal is not therefore required. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, leave to appeal is required. Section
    784(1), contained in Part XXVI of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>, provides a right of appeal to the court of appeal from decisions
    granting or refusing relief sought by way of extraordinary remedy. Section
    784(2) states:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="headingNUMBER" style="line-height:normal;">784(2)
      Except as provided in this section, Part XXI applies, with such modifications
      as the circumstances require, to appeals under this section. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I see nothing in s. 784 that in any way ousts or limits
    the application of s. 676.1 in relation to an appeal from a costs order made on
    an application for an extraordinary remedy. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, as I have concluded that the application judge
    applied the wrong test in ordering costs in this matter, I would grant leave to
    appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>            <b>ii)
    The Test for Making a Costs Order against the ORB in this Proceeding</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Apart from an issue raised in this court about whether
    a costs order can properly be made generally against an intervener tribunal for
    the costs of the proceeding in front of the tribunal, the ORB did not contest
    the application judge’s jurisdiction to make a costs order against it. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Assuming, without deciding, that the application judge
    had jurisdiction to make a costs order against the ORB in this proceeding, in
    my opinion the application judge erred by applying the wrong test for awarding
    costs. Given the nature and function of the ORB and the nature of this proceeding,
    the application judge ought to have applied a test that is at least as
    stringent as the test that applies for making a costs order against the Crown.
    I say that for four reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the ORB is a specialized statutory tribunal
    created under Part XX.1 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> and must act in the public interest, not unlike the Crown. The
    principles that have guided the awarding of costs against the Crown should
    apply to cost awards against the ORB.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As noted in <i>Winko
    v. British Columbia (Forensic Psychiatric Institute)</i>, [1999] 2 S.C.R. 625,
    under Part XX.1 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>,
    review boards bear the responsibility for the ongoing assessment and management
    of persons found to have committed criminal offences for which they are held not
    criminally responsible. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under s. 672.54 of the Criminal Code, review boards
    have a duty to protect the public from significant threats to their safety but,
    at the same time, to impose the least onerous and least restrictive disposition
    on NCR accused. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As described in <i>Winko</i>,
    s. 672.54 “is remarkable among provisions in the Canadian <i>Criminal Code</i> in that it does not place burdens of proof on either
    party. It is not adversarial in the usual sense”. Rather, it creates a regime that
    is inquisitorial, and it is the review boards that bear the ultimate
    responsibility for gathering and reviewing all available evidence and for protecting
    the interests of the public as well as the interests of the NCR accused: see <i>Winko</i> at paras. 29-55 and 60-62.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This court reviewed the rationale for the principles
    involved in making costs orders against the Crown in <i>R. v. Ciarniello</i> (2006), 81 O.R. (3d) 561. As noted at para. 31 of
    that decision, ““… whether the criminal defendant is successful or unsuccessful
    on the merits of the case, he or she is generally not entitled to costs.” It is
    only where the accused can show “a marked and unacceptable departure from the
    reasonable standards expected of the prosecution” that a costs order will be
    made”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After noting that “[r]outine costs awards are a feature
    of civil, not criminal proceedings”, Sharpe J.A. explained the rationale for
    the principles involved in making costs orders against the Crown at para. 33:</p>
  <p>Different considerations apply to criminal proceedings. <i>Criminal proceedings are brought in the
    public interest</i>, not by one party to vindicate his or her private interests
    as against another. As Devlin L.J. explained in <i>Berry v. British Transport Commission</i>, [1962] 1 Q.B. 306, [1961] 3
    All E.R. 65 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ),
    at p. 327 Q.B.: &quot;A plaintiff brings an action for his own ends and to
    benefit himself; it is therefore just that if he loses he should pay the costs. <i>A prosecutor brings proceedings in the
    public interest, and so should be treated more tenderly</i>.&quot; Costs are
    not usually deployed in criminal law to influence the conduct of litigation.
    The threat of conviction and loss of liberty provides an adequate incentive to
    the accused to defend the case. <i>As the
    Crown acts in the public interest when conducting criminal prosecutions, it is
    said that its discretion should not be influenced or fettered by the threat of
    a costs award…</i> [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given the crucial role of the ORB in protecting the
    public from significant threats to its safety and also in protecting and
    preserving the dignity and liberty interests of NCR accused, I view it as being
    equally important that, in the absence of egregious misconduct constituting a
    marked departure and unacceptable departure from the reasonable standards
    expected of a review board, the discretion of the ORB “should not be influenced
    or fettered” by the threat of a costs order. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, unlike the proceedings before other tribunals
    against which costs orders may have been made on other occasions, the
    proceedings before the ORB and before the application judge were conducted
    under the <i>Criminal Code</i>. There is no
    provision in the <i>Criminal Code</i> for making
    a costs order against the ORB. Although the respondent made some submissions before
    the application judge relating to s. 24(1) of the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>, the application judge made
    no findings in that regard and did not invoke any <i>Charter</i> jurisdiction to award costs that may exist. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, to the extent that jurisdiction exists to
    make a costs order against the ORB in this proceeding, it must be found within
    the inherent jurisdiction of the Superior Court to award costs in criminal
    matters. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, apart from the remedial powers under s. 24(1) of
    the <i>Charter</i>, the jurisdiction for
    awarding costs in criminal matters is extremely narrow and the threshold is very
    high. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As noted in <i>R. v. Chapman</i> (2006), 78 O.R. (3d) 778
    (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>

    <st1:country-region

    ),
    L'Heureux-Dubé J.A. described that jurisdiction as follows, at pp. 449 and 451: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p style="text-autospace:none"><span
style='font-size:12.0pt'><span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'><span> </span></span></span>[TRANSLATION] <i>A superior court has the power to maintain its authority and to control
      its procedure so as to put justice in order and efficiently.</i> That this
      implies sometimes ordering one of the parties and even lawyers to pay the costs
      of a proceeding in cases of the abuse or of the frivolity of proceedings, of
      misconduct or dishonesty or of taken for some other ulterior motive, is a
      recognized principle. <i>But the conditions
        for the exercise of this inherent power must exist.</i></p>
    <p>. . . </p>
    <p style="text-autospace:

    <p style="text-autospace:
none"><i>On the one hand, the Judge cannot authorize himself to do indirectly

      costs with respect to extraordinary remedies in criminal matters. <i>In the absence of reprehensible conduct by
        the appellants, or a serious affront to the authority of the Court or of a

        present debate is in no way justified.</i> [Emphasis added.]<u></u></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  Fourth, I see
    no basis for treating this matter as if it is somehow akin to a civil matter in
    which Superior Courts may exercise a much broader inherent discretionary jurisdiction
    in awarding costs. Although NCR accused are found not criminally responsible,
    they are subject to the jurisdiction of the ORB because they committed an act
    that was contrary to the <i>Criminal Code</i>.
    The ongoing assessment and management of NCR accused is dealt with under Part
    XX.1 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> and forms a
    part of the criminal justice system. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover, proceedings under Part XX.1 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> are not similar to civil
    proceedings. As already noted, they have an important public interest component
    that must outweigh factors that may mandate an award of costs in civil cases. As
    explained by Sharpe J.A. in <i>Ciarniello</i>,
    costs awards in civil cases serve several purposes that are generally either
    not applicable in criminal cases or at least not at the forefront in terms of
    making costs awards. At paras. 32 and 33, Sharpe J.A. said the following: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="headingNUMBER" style="line-height:normal;">Routine costs awards in favour of the winning
      party are a feature of civil, not criminal proceedings. Costs awards in civil
      litigation serve several purposes. Costs in civil cases are awarded on the
      compensatory principle that it is just to allow the successful civil litigant
      at least partial indemnity for the costs of the action. Costs sanctions are
      also an important tool at the disposal of civil courts to control proceedings
      and to discourage unreasonable or inappropriate behaviour. Especially when
      fortified with offer to settle rules that penalize unreasonable litigation, the
      threat of an adverse costs award serves to discourage unnecessary or frivolous
      litigation and encourages parties to settle their disputes.</p>
    <p class="headingNUMBER" style="line-height:normal;">Different considerations apply to criminal
      proceedings… Costs are not usually deployed in criminal law to influence the
      conduct of litigation. The threat of conviction and loss of liberty provides an
      adequate incentive to the accused to defend the case. As the Crown acts in the
      public interest when conducting criminal prosecutions, it is said that its
      discretion should not be influenced or fettered by the threat of a costs award.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly, to the extent that the application
    judge had jurisdiction to award costs against the ORB, that jurisdiction must
    surely reside within and be circumscribed by the Superior Court’s inherent
    jurisdiction to award costs in criminal law matters. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>            iii)
    Application of the Test to the Facts of this Case</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Assuming that a costs order can be made against the
    ORB, the circumstances of this case do not meet the high threshold necessary
    for making such an award. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge rejected the respondent’s request
    for full indemnity costs because this was the first time the ORB had dealt with
    the present issues relating to its inquisitorial role and because she was
    satisfied that although the ORB “acted erroneously and… was misguided… [it] did
    not act maliciously.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my opinion, the application judge’s findings that
    this was the first time the ORB had to deal with the issues relating to the
    exercise of its inquisitorial role and that the ORB did not act maliciously
    negate the propriety of a costs award in this case. Such findings simply do not
    reflect “marked and unacceptable departure from the reasonable standards”
    expected of a review board. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, these findings stand in sharp contrast to the
    facts in <i>Curragh</i>, in which the trial
    judge presiding over a criminal trial telephoned a senior member of the
    Attorney General’s staff and recommended that the Crown attorney involved in
    the trial be removed. Although the Supreme Court of Canada did not identify the
    source of its jurisdiction to award costs payable by the Crown in that case, such
    conduct is patently a “marked and unacceptable departure” from the norm. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whatever standard may be applicable in making an award
    of costs against other administrative or quasi-judicial tribunals, just as the
    application judge’s findings did not support an award of substantial indemnity
    costs, they do not meet the high threshold that would be necessary to support a
    costs award against the ORB based on the inherent jurisdiction of the Superior
    Court to award costs in criminal cases. </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based on the foregoing reasons, I would grant leave to
    appeal, allow the appeal, set aside the application judge’s award of costs and
    substitute an order that there be no costs of the application. There will be no
    order as to costs of this appeal.</p>
