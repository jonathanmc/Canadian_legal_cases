    judge erred in vacating an order prohibiting the removal of the appellant’s
    children from
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario.  The order was made as an incident to granting
    the appellant’s unopposed custody application.  The appeal court judge held that the order was not made in relation to a
    family law <i>lis</i> but was made to effect
    a stay of the order directing the removal of the appellant and her eldest
    daughter by immigration authorities.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons below, I would hold that the appeal
    court judge did not err in vacating the non-removal order.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant is a citizen of
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      St. Lucia</st1:country-region>
    .  She moved with her daughter, Jewel, also a
    citizen of
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">St. Lucia</st1:country-region>
    , to
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario in the summer of
    2003.  Following their arrival, the
    appellant made a refugee claim on behalf of herself and Jewel in relation to
    threats by an abusive ex-boyfriend and the alleged failure of the state to
    protect her and her daughter from domestic violence.  The claim was denied on November 14,
    2003.  The Refugee Protection Division member
    found the appellant credible and believed her history but concluded that she
    had failed to rebut the presumption of state protection.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant applied for leave to appeal and for
    judicial review of the decision.  Her
    application was denied on March 24, 2004.  The appellant says that she was then incorrectly advised to wait for a
    pre-removal risk assessment (“PRRA”).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the meantime, the appellant became involved with the
    respondent F.A.  The two had a child
    together named Fianna.  The appellant and
    F.A. lived together in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario
    from approximately January 2004 to sometime in 2005 when they separated.  F.A. is on good terms with the appellant and
    has seen Fianna on a weekly basis since the parties separated.  He has married another woman and does not want
    custody of Fianna but wishes to continue to have frequent and regular access
    with her.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In November of 2005, Jewel and Fianna were removed from
    the appellant’s care by the Children’s Aid Society of Toronto (the “Society”). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On August 1, 2006, the appellant’s PRRA assessment
    application was denied.  The immigration
    officer affirmed the Board’s earlier finding at her refugee hearing that the
    existence of state protection negated the necessity for international
    protection.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant and Jewel were scheduled to be removed
    from
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    on September 17, 2006.  However, the
    removal order was deferred pending the resolution of the child protection
    proceedings at the request of the appellant and the Society.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In October 2006, the appellant applied on behalf of
    herself and Jewel to remain in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    on humanitarian and compassionate (“H&amp;C”) grounds.  The appellant says that the delay in filing
    the application was due to incorrect advice received by an immigration official
    in 2004.  The respondents say they have
    no knowledge of any such advice being given. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The H&amp;C application was based primarily on the best
    interests of the children. Specifically, the appellant argued that: (1) the
    children would be exposed to domestic violence or would witness violence against
    the appellant by her ex-boyfriend if they were sent back to St. Lucia; (2)
    Jewel needed to remain in Canada to get adequate treatment for a learning disability
    which is unavailable in St. Lucia; and, (3) Fianna is a Canadian citizen who
    has lived in Canada all her life; she would be deprived of a relationship with
    her father who is unable to care for her permanently and would suffer greatly
    from separation from her mother and sister.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On January 11, 2007, the Ontario Court of Justice made
    a final order terminating the Society’s supervision of the appellant’s care of
    the children. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On February 1, 2007 the appellant received a Direction
    to Report to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Pearson
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Airport for deportation on
    February 26.  At this time, the H&amp;C
    application had not been considered. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On February 15, 2007, the appellant’s counsel requested
    that the removal order be deferred pending a full consideration of the children’s
    best interests as set out in the pending H&amp;C application.  This request was rejected.  The enforcement officer noted that Jewel would
    be able to obtain whatever educational support there was available in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">St. Lucia</st1:country-region>
    ,
    however inferior it would be according to Canadian standards.  Furthermore, he observed that Jewel’s learning
    disability was permanent and would likely require an indefinite deferral of
    removal which could only be granted in very exceptional cases.  The officer also noted that the matter had
    been deferred pending the child protection proceedings and that no further
    impediments to deportation existed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On February 23, 2007, the appellant brought an
    application before Scully J. in the Ontario Court of Justice for custody of her
    two children and a non-removal order.  She
    admitted that the reason for the request was to obtain a court order that would
    trigger the   statutory stay of the
    removal order under s. 50(a) of the <i>Immigration
    and Refugee Protection Act</i>, 2001, c. 27, I-2.5 (“<i>IRPA</i>”).  That section
    provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>50.
    A removal order is stayed:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a) if a decision that was made in a judicial
    proceeding – at which the Minister shall be given the opportunity to make
    submissions – would be directly contravened by the enforcement of the removal
    order;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Ministers were given short notice and an
    opportunity to intervene.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE MOTION JUDGE’S DECISION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge granted the appellant’s application
    for custody and the non-removal order.  He
    further ordered: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2.         As
    an incident of custody, both children shall remain in the direct physical care
    and control of the mother, [J.H.] pending further order of this Court</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3.         Neither
    child, Jewel or Fianna, is to be removed from the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">
    Province of
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">

    pending further order of this Court</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge reasoned that while other courts may
    at times take the best interests of children into consideration, they are not
    mandated to do so.  He observed that the
    only courts that must make such a decision are the Superior Court and the Court
    of Justice pursuant to the provisions of the <i>Children’s Law Reform Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.12<i> </i>(“<i>CLRA</i>”).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge accepted the Society’s conclusion that
    the appellant was a mother who could be trusted with the care of her
    children.  He found that it would not be
    in Fianna’s best interests to be separated from her mother and sister.  He also accepted the appellant’s contention
    that since Fianna’s father would not be willing or able to take custody of her,
    she would be deprived of a relationship with her father in the absence of a
    non-removal order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to Jewel, the motion judge expressed
    concern that if she were removed from
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario
    she would be at risk of serious harm if exposed to domestic violence or if she
    witnessed violence committed against her mother.  He accepted the appellant’s contention that it
    would not be in Jewel’s best interests to be removed from Canada prior to the
    H&amp;C application given her learning disability which, based on the
    uncontradicted evidence, would not be adequately addressed by the St. Lucia
    school system.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent Ministers successfully appealed the
    motion judge’s decision.  The essence of
    the appeal court judge’s decision may be summarized as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There was no family law <i>lis </i>before the motions judge.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, there was no family law dispute
    with respect to incidents of custody between the parents.  One child’s father had not participated in
    the proceedings at all.  The other had no
    desire for custody.  There was no
    suggestion that any of the parties had any interest in removing children from
    <st1:place

    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario.  The relevant paragraphs of the order were
    aimed not at the parents of the child but at the respondent Ministers pending
    the outcome of the H&amp;C application.  The <i>CLRA </i>should not be used to
    frustrate the <i>IRPA</i>.  The <i>IRPA </i>and related legislation is the forum in which to address immigration and
    related claims.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In any event, even if the motions judge’s order was
    restored, recent jurisprudence from the Federal Court of Appeal, the court
    charged with the primary responsibility of interpreting the <i>IRPA, </i>indicates that the <i>CLRA</i> order would not affect a s. 50(a)
    statutory stay of the removal order.  In <i>Idahosa v. The Minister of Public Safety and
    Emergency Preparedness</i>, 2008 FCA 418,<i> </i>Evans J.A. on behalf of a unanimous court, held at para. 59:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[p]aragraph 50(a) does not apply to a provincial
    court’s order awarding custody to a parent of Canadian-born children for the
    purpose of delaying or preventing the enforcement of a removal order against
    the parent, when there is no <i>lis </i>respecting
    custody that is unrelated to the removal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In coming to this conclusion, Evans J.A. held that the <i>IRPA</i> provides opportunities for the
    consideration of the best interests of the children of those subject to
    deportation.  He also stated at para 54:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>While great weight must be given to the best
    interests of children in administrative decision-making, they do not
    necessarily outweigh all other considerations: <i>Baker v.

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with and would apply this analysis to the
    consideration of whether the non-removal order should have been made in the
    circumstances of this case.  The
    reasoning in <i>Idahosa </i>is consistent
    with the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario
    cases which indicate that non-removal orders under the <i>CLRA </i>should not be granted for the purpose of frustrating removal
    orders in immigration proceedings.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, as the appeal judge observed, it is open
    to the appellant to make an application in the Federal Court for a stay of
    removal pending the determination of her H&amp;C application.  This is the appropriate forum for
    consideration and weighing of the various competing interests.  </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the facts of this case, the non-removal order ought
    not to have been made and the appeal judge did not err in vacating it.  Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal. </p>

    between the parties” or a contest over “competing parenting plans”.  Indeed, the CLRA contemplates that custody
    orders may be made absent a contest between the parents.  Section 62(5) contemplates custody orders
    where the identity of the father is not known or capable of being
    ascertained.  Moreover, family courts
    routinely make custody orders for collateral purposes such as school
    registration or passport application if it is in the best interest of the
    children to do so.</p>
