    2003, Harris J. found that the appellants were operating businesses in
    violation of the <i>Regulated Health
    Professions Act</i>, R.S.O. 1991, c. 18 (“<i>RHPA</i>”)
    by dispensing prescription eyewear to customers without valid prescriptions

    24, 2006, Crane J. found the appellants in contempt of the Harris Judgment (the
    “Crane Judgment”). Crane J. made a series of mandatory orders to ensure
    compliance with the Harris Judgment and granted leave to the

    College of

    judge found that the appellants had failed to purge their contempt.  Pursuant to the terms of the Crane Judgment, Fedak
    J. (the “Fedak Judgment”) ordered the appellants to pay a fine of $50,000 per
    day from the date of the Crane Judgment to the date of his judgment.  The fine totalled $16,000,000. </p>

    hearing of the motion before Fedak J., this Court on October 10, 2008, for
    reasons written by Watt J.A., dismissed the appeal from the order of Crane
    J.  The background of this protracted
    litigation is fully set out in the reasons of Watt J.A. and we do not propose to
    repeat it here.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

    appellants appealed from the judgment of Fedak J. on numerous grounds.  Many of the issues raised on this appeal,
    particularly certain <i>Charter</i> related
    arguments, were addressed by Watt J. in his reasons on the appeal from the
    judgment of Crane J.  We will not
    reconsider those issues.  The court
    called on the respondents on three issues raised by the appellants, namely: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>were the appellants given a fair opportunity to address

      mitigating factors in respect of sentence in the proceedings before Fedak J.?;  and</p>
    <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>was the evidence relied on by Fedak J. in
      finding non-compliance with the Crane Judgment affected by the order and
      reasons of Perell J. arising out of an application brought by COO against the
      operators of the franchised stores?; and</p>
    <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the fitness of the penalty.</p>

  <h2>The Fairness of the Proceedings Before Fedak J.</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants submitted that the motion before Fedak J. was a new contempt motion
    to which rule 60.05 applied. It is clear from the Notice of Motion that the
    motion before Fedak J. was brought under Rule 37 of the Rules of Civil
    Procedure.  The proceeding was not a new contempt
    motion but a hearing to determine whether the appellants had complied with the
    Crane Judgment and, if not, whether the fine contemplated by Crane J. for
    further violations of his order should be imposed.  Accordingly, the motion was not brought under
    60.05.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants’ assertion that they were denied a fair opportunity to address the
    allegations of non-compliance with the Crane order in the proceedings before
    Fedak J. requires reference to the chronology of events leading up to the
    motion. In December 2006, counsel for COM put the appellants on notice that COM
    took the position that the appeal from the order of Crane J. stayed only the
    requirement that the appellants pay the one million dollar fine.  COM advised the appellants that it took the
    position that the rest of the Crane order remained in full force and effect and
    must be complied with pending appeal.  COM
    did not receive any response from the appellants.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Five months
    later in April 2007, COM commenced the motion that was eventually heard by
    Fedak J. over several days in August 2007.  In their notice, COM sought “orders to carry out the mandatory terms of
    the order of Crane J.” COM expressly alleged that the appellants were not
    complying with the order of Crane J. in several respects. COM sought an order
    rendering the appellants liable for fines of $50,000 per day from the date of
    the Crane order. Detailed affidavit evidence accompanied the motion.<span
style='"Times New Roman"'>  Based
    on the Notice of Motion and the affidavits, the appellants must have been fully
    aware of the nature of the allegations made against them and the relief sought
    against them by COM. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motion
    was case managed and certain time limits were set for the filing of
    material.  The Appellants chose to file
    no material until the last day permitted under those time limits.  On that day they filed a cross-motion but did
    not file any response to the allegations in the material served on them four
    months earlier.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    cross-motion sought to stay COM’s motion, strike certain paragraphs of the
    motion and strike certain parts of the affidavits filed by COM.  A host of arguments was advanced in support
    of these claims.  None addressed the question
    of whether the appellants were in compliance with the order of Crane J. and
    none responded to the factual allegations made in the College’s material.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At the outset
    of the motion before Fedak J., counsel and the motion judge engaged in a
    lengthy discussion as to the order in which the motion and the cross-motion
    should be addressed, and as to the nature of COM’s motions.  We need not resolve the issues raised in that
    debate any further than to repeat our earlier observation that the motion was
    clearly brought under rule 37 and not rule 60.05.  More to the point of this ground of appeal,
    we are satisfied that nothing said or done by the motion judge in the course of
    those discussions precluded the appellants in any way from answering the
    allegations of COM on the merits had the appellants wished to do so. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Three factors
    support our conclusion.  First, the
    appellants had ample opportunity between April and August to place material before
    the court answering the allegations made in the material of COM.  They also had ample time to cross-examine the
    affiants relied on by COM.  If counsel
    for the appellants saw any real prejudice in presenting the appellants’
    affidavits before cross-examining on COM’s affidavits, counsel could have moved
    before the case management judge for an order directing that the
    cross-examination precede the filing of the appellants’ affidavits.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As the motion
    judge observed, the appellants made a tactical decision not to produce any
    evidence whatsoever that they had complied or attempted to comply with the terms
    of the Crane Judgment. This tactical approach is consistent with the approach
    taken in the proceedings before Crane J. where the appellants did not challenge
    the evidence offered by COM.  Nothing in
    the conduct of the proceedings violated any <i>Charter</i> right that may have been engaged. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second, nothing
    said or done by the motion judge in the course of the discussion at the outset
    of the motion precluded the appellants from specifically asking the motion
    judge for an adjournment to permit the appellants to place material before him.  The motion judge may or may not have granted
    the adjournment had it been sought.  We
    have reviewed the transcript.  If anything,
    the transcript suggests that counsel, after being informed by the motion judge
    of the manner in which he proposed to proceed and after consulting with the
    appellants during a brief adjournment, decided to proceed without requesting an
    adjournment to adduce evidence or to cross-examine the affiants.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third, counsel,
    when pressed on the appeal, could not describe any affirmative evidence that
    she could have proffered before Fedak J. to challenge the allegations of COM. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There is no
    merit to the appellants’ allegation that that they were denied a fair
    opportunity to challenge the allegations or present evidence to mitigate their
    contempt.  Nor were there any procedural
    or constitutional errors that warrant setting aside the Fedak Judgment.</p>
  <h2>The Effect of the Judgment of Perell J.</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants submit that Fedak J. erred in using evidence of the conduct of certain
    franchisees as a basis for holding that the appellants were in breach of the
    order of Crane J.  The basis for this
    submission lies in the reasons of Perell J. given in the course of a proceeding
    involving COO and certain of the franchisees.  The appellants contend that in the course of his reasons, Perell J. held
    that the franchisees were distinct legal entities from the appellants.  The appellant submits that it follows that
    the conduct of the franchisees in the operation of their stores could not be
    used as a basis for a finding that the appellants were in breach of the order
    of Crane J.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span

    unnecessary to decide whether the appellants accurately describe the effect of
    the reasons of Perell J.  Although, some
    of the respondents’ evidence of non-compliance related to stores operated by
    the franchisees, the motion judge had ample evidence that the company stores
    controlled by the individual complainants were not complying with the Crane
    Judgment.  The material before Fedak J.
    established that the Great Glasses operation had not changed and that the
    company’s Great Glasses stores continued to dispense eyeglasses without a
    prescription.</p>

    Fedak J. did not impute the conduct of the franchisees to the appellants.  Rather, at para. 67 of his reasons, he used
    the evidence relating to the operation of the franchised stores to draw the
    inference that Mr. Bergez was not complying with certain provisions of the
    Crane Judgment which required him to take steps to ensure that the franchisees
    complied with appropriate business practices.  That inference was open to Fedak J. on the evidence.  </p>
  <h2>The Penalty</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants argue that a fine of $50,000 a day leading to a total penalty of
    $16,000,000 was excessive and far beyond the penalty justified in the
    circumstances.  The appellants suggest a
    fine of $25,000.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Obviously,
    the fine imposed is a very significant one.  However, the brazen nature of the appellants’ contempt, its lengthy and
    ongoing nature, and the risk to the public health and safety posed by the appellants’
    conduct demanded a substantial fine that would act as a strong disincentive to the
    continuation of this kind of conduct.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants were fully<span style='"Times New Roman"'> aware, given the terms of the order of Crane J., of the financial
    risk they ran if they chose to continue to operate in violation of court
    orders.  Knowledge that they faced a fine
    of up to $50,000 a day did not deter the appellants from continuing to operate
    their business in violation of court orders.  The $1,000,000 fine imposed by Crane J. was similarly ineffective.  The appellants are business people.  One can only assume that they judged the financial
    risk associated with non-compliance and deemed that risk worth the potential
    financial gain occasioned by continued operation in violation of the court
    order.  The fact that the appellants,
    having been fined $1,000,000, carried on their operation in violation of an
    order knowing that they faced potentially huge penalties, speaks loudly to the need
    for a very significant penalty.  </span></p>

    a question for the motion judge and considerable deference is owed to his
    determination.  We see no error in

    of Crane J.</span></p>
