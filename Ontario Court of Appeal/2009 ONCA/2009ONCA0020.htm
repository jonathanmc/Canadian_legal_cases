  <h4><span lang=EN-US>OVERVIEW</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal raises a narrow but important point of
    statutory interpretation. At issue is the proper construction of the term
    “record” in s. 2(1) of the <i>Municipal
    Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. M. 56
    (the “Act”). At stake is the ability of the public to access electronically
    recorded information, under the control of a municipal government institution, in a
    format that would require the institution to develop a new algorithm to modify its
    existing computer software.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Subsection 2(1) of the Act is titled “Interpretation”.
    It contains a number of defined terms, including the term “record”, which is
    defined as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>2. (1) In this
    Act,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>“record” means
    any record of information however recorded, whether in printed form, on film,
    by electronic means or otherwise, and includes,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>correspondence, a memorandum, a book, a plan, a map, a
    drawing, a diagram, a pictorial or graphic work, a photograph, a film, a
    microfilm, a sound recording, a videotape, a machine readable record, any other
    documentary material, regardless of physical form or characteristics, and any
    copy thereof, and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:
left;'>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span> subject to the regulations, any record that is
    capable of being produced from a machine readable record under the control of
    an institution by means of computer hardware and software or any other
    information storage equipment and technical expertise <i>normally used by the institution</i>; (“document”) [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Subsection (b) of s. 2(1) is the provision at issue in
    this appeal. Of particular concern is the emphasized phrase “normally used by
    the institution” and the interpretation it is to be given in the context of
    this case.  The factual background to
    this interpretative issue is briefly stated as follows.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, James Rankin, is a journalist with the
    Toronto Star newspaper. He made two related requests under the Act for information
    stored in two electronic databases maintained by the Toronto Police Service
    (the “Police”), in a format different than the format in which the information
    is stored by the Police.  The Police have
    the technical expertise needed to retrieve the information he seeks, in the
    format he has requested. To do so, however, they have to design an algorithm that
    is capable of extracting and manipulating the information that presently exists
    in the two electronic databases and re-formatting it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Toronto Police Services Board (the “Board”) refused
    Mr.&nbsp;Rankin’s requests for various reasons. Central to this appeal is the
    Board’s contention that the Police are not legally obliged to provide Mr.
    Rankin with the information he seeks, in the format requested, because to do so
    would require the Police to create new software – software that they do not
    normally use. The Board contends that, because the requests require the use of
    new software, the information being sought is not a “record” under s. 2(1)(b)
    of the Act. Since Mr. Rankin’s entitlement to access is limited by s. 4(1) of
    the Act to a “record”, his requests therefore fail.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Board did not raise that specific argument on Mr.
    Rankin’s appeals to the Information and Privacy Commissioner/Ontario challenging
    the Board’s refusal to disclose. Before Adjudicator DeVries (the “Adjudicator”),
    the Board raised three points: first, it was impossible to produce the records
    sought by Mr. Rankin, in the format requested, because the data needed to
    produce them did not exist in a recorded form; second, if the data did exist in
    a recorded form, the records being sought were exempted by s. 1 of Regulation
    823, R.R.O. 1990, because the process of producing them would unreasonably
    interfere with the operations of the Police; and third, if the data did exist
    in a recorded form, compliance with Mr. Rankin’s requests would require the Police
    to create a new record, something they were not obliged to do.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Adjudicator rejected those arguments. His reasons
    are found in <i><span lang=EN-US>Re Toronto Police Services Board</span></i><span
lang=EN-US> (November 7, 2005), </span>Order
    MO-1989 (IPC/Ontario). In a nutshell, he found that the information being sought
    by Mr. Rankin constituted a “record” under the Act and he ordered the Board to respond
    to Mr. Rankin’s requests by issuing access decisions in accordance with the notice
    provisions of the Act.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Board applied to the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court for judicial review of
    the Adjudicator’s order. On the application, the Board explicitly raised for
    the first time the issue that the information requested by Mr.&nbsp;Rankin did
    not constitute a “record” within the language of s. 2(1)(b) of the Act because
    it could only be produced by means of software that the Police did not normally
    use. The
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court
    found favour with that argument and quashed the order of the Adjudicator. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Rankin and the Commissioner now appeal to this
    court, with leave, from that decision.  The intervener, Canadian Civil Liberties
    Association, supports their bid to have the order of the Commissioner restored.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal, set

    pertinent facts are largely identified in the overview. By way of brief elaboration,
    James Rankin is a journalist with the Toronto Star newspaper. Since May 2003,
    he has been seeking information about individuals with whom the Police have
    come into contact in the course of their duties. The information he wants is
    stored in two electronic databases maintained by the Police – the Criminal
    Information Processing System (“CIPS”) and the Master Name Index (“MANIX”). </span></p>

    its present form, the recorded information contains personal identifiers from
    which an individual’s identity can be determined. That information raises
    obvious privacy concerns and Mr. Rankin does not want it. What he seeks is
    information from which he can determine whether a particular individual, on
    record with the Police, has been arrested on one occasion only or on more than
    one occasion. To accomplish that, he has asked that the unique identifiers for
    each individual “be replaced with randomly generated, unique numbers, and that
    only one unique number be used for each individual.” That way, he can obtain
    the information he seeks without infringing the privacy rights of the
    individuals with whom the Police have made contact.</span></p>

    technical know-how, the Police can design the algorithm using software they
    presently have. According to Detective Angus, “[i]t would take approximately
    two weeks to extract and manipulate the data to meet the request.” Detective
    Angus further deposed that the end product would be less than accurate because

    Mr. Rankin’s appeals to the Commissioner from the Board’s refusal to produce
    the records in the format requested, Adjudicator DeVries considered the
    affidavit evidence filed and the arguments presented and identified three
    issues for determination:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>The first issue is whether the basic
    information – that is, unique identifiers – exist in a “recorded” form in the
    identified database, and are capable of being produced from machine readable
    records by means of computer hardware and software or any other information
    storage equipment and technical expertise normally used by the institution.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>If the answer to this issue is yes,
    the second issue to be decided is whether the process of producing the
    information would unreasonably interfere with the operations of the Police (as
    the definition of “record” is limited by section 1 of Regulation 823).</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>If the process of producing the
    record would not unreasonably interfere with the operations of the institution,
    then the unique identifiers constitute a “record” for the purpose of the <i>Act</i>. The final issue to be decided,
    based on the wording of the request, is whether the Police are required to
    provide the appellant with a record which replaces the unique identifiers with
    randomly-generated, unique numbers (p.9).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
    the first issue, contrary to the position of the Board, the Adjudicator found
    that unique identifiers, such as names or other personal information that could
    potentially identify individuals, did exist in a “recorded” form for
    individuals whose information is entered in the databases and that these unique
    identifiers were capable of being produced from a machine readable record. In
    so concluding, the Adjudicator accepted the Police’s submissions that “the
    extraction of the requested information would be time-consuming, and would
    result in certain inaccuracies in the information.” However, he concluded that
    “this does not mean that a unique identifier does not exist in a form that is
    accessible, and that it is not a ‘record’ for the purpose of the <i>Act</i>.” To the extent that the “records
    produced would [only] be between 65-70% accurate”, the Adjudicator found that
    “the accuracy of the data is not relevant to whether it should be produced or
    not.” In his opinion, “as long as a requester is advised of the potential
    inaccuracies in a record, the test for whether a record is required to be
    produced under the <i>Act</i> is not
    contingent on its accuracy” (</span>pp. 14-15).</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    sum, on the evidence before him, the Adjudicator was satisfied that unique
    identifiers did exist in the two electronic databases controlled by the Police
    and that these identifiers were capable of being produced from a machine
    readable record.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
    the second issue of whether the process of producing the record would unreasonably
    interfere with the operations of the institution, the Adjudicator noted that
    the Police did “not identify how the extraction of the information would
    obstruct or hinder the range of effectiveness of the Police’s activities.” In
    the Adjudicator’s opinion, the fact that “extracting the information would take
    time and effort” is not a sufficient basis for finding that the process would
    unreasonably interfere with the operations of the Police. In this regard, he observed
    by way of “an aside” that the “costs regarding the production of records are chargeable
    under the <i>Act</i>” (</span>pp. 17-18).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    his consideration of the third issue – would replacing the unique identifiers
    with randomly-generated numbers constitute creating a record –  the Adjudicator reviewed the pertinent facts:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>In this appeal, I have found that
    the information containing unique identifiers exists in both the CIPS and MANIX
    databases. As noted above, these identifiers may vary in the information they
    contain; however, these unique identifiers “link” the information in the
    records to identifiable individuals – and consequently “link” certain
    occurrences found in the records to each other. In my view, these “linkages”
    constitute “recorded” information for the purpose of the <i>Act</i>. These links exist and are capable of being produced from
    machine readable records (p. 19).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    Adjudicator then reviewed an earlier order of the Commission in which Assistant
    Commissioner Mitchinson held that the Police were required to disclose a record
    notwithstanding the need for it to be reformatted prior to disclosure: <i>Re Toronto Police Services Board</i> (December 21, 2000), Order MO-1381 (IPC/Ontario). Applying that reasoning to
    the facts before him, Adjudicator DeVries concluded:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>In the present appeals, I have
    determined that the unique identifiers or “linkages” exist in the database. Due
    to the fact that the information is contained in a record that is capable of
    being produced from a machine readable record under the control of an
    institution by means of computer software, I am satisfied that replacing these
    unique identifiers or “links” with unique numbers does not constitute
    “creating” a record – no “new” information is created. The information provided
    to the appellant in response to the request is the same recorded information,
    but simply in a modified, anonymized format. Replacing the unique identifiers
    with randomly-generated numbers does not change the nature of the information;
    rather, in these circumstances, it serves the purpose of anonymizing the
    information. In my view doing so does not result in the creation of new
    information or the creation of a new record (p.22).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally,
    in deciding whether the information constituted a record that had to be
    created, the Adjudicator addressed “the issue of how difficult it might be to
    replace the identifiers with randomly generated numbers.” In this regard, he
    noted Detective Angus’ evidence and found:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>… that it is possible to develop
    software which would replace a unique identifier with a random number. The Police’s
    concern that an algorithm would have to be specifically developed seems to me
    to be covered in the fees section of the <i>Act</i> (see section 6 of Regulation 823, which allows for fees for developing a
    computer program or other method of producing a record from machine readable
    record, and for the costs, including computer costs, that the institution
    incurs in locating, retrieving, processing and copying the record if those
    costs are specified in an invoice that the institution has received) (p. 23).</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>The Adjudicator
    also took account of the affidavit evidence of Mr. Rankin’s expert, Mr.
    Faulkner, regarding the relative ease of creating the algorithm needed to
    replace unique identifiers with random, unique numbers.</p>

line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the end, the Adjudicator found it unnecessary to determine
    the degree of difficulty involved in producing the records sought by Mr. Rankin,
    in the format requested. Taking his lead once again from the decision of
    Assistant Commissioner Mitchinson in Order MO-1381, the Adjudicator found “that
    the method or format by which these linkages [unique identifiers] are
    ultimately produced is not critical to the issue of whether they constitute a
    record” (p. 23).</p>

    provisions of the Act. </p>

    the Divisional Court, in addition to relying on the arguments it had raised
    before the Adjudicator, the Board advanced for the first time the argument that
    the information Mr. Rankin was seeking did not constitute a “record” as defined

    requested, by means of software the Police did not normally use. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As
    indicated, the Divisional Court accepted that argument. Carnwath J., for the
    court, addressed the s. 2(1)(b) issue in brief but succinct reasons, the relevant
    portions of which are reproduced here:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>In construing s. 2(b), I conclude
    that the words “normally used by the institution” qualify both “by means of
    computer hardware and software” and “any other information storage equipment
    and technical expertise”.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>I do so for two reasons. First, the
    use of the words “any other” convey the sense that the two phrases connected by
    “or” speak of equipment, similar in nature, capable of producing a record from
    a machine-readable record.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>Second, it would make no sense to
    have different requirements of the institution to “produce a record” depending
    on whether it could be done “by means of computer hardware and software” or
    whether “by any other information storage equipment and technical expertise”.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>Thus, an analysis of s. 2(b)
    requires:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span
lang=EN-US>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>If requirement three is not
    satisfied, that is the end of the matter. If it is satisfied, there remains the
    requirement established by s. 1 of Reg. 823 that the “producing” must not
    unreasonably interfere with the operation of the institution.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>The Assistant Commissioner, in
    answering the first question, found that a unique identifier existed in a form
    accessible through the CIPS system and the MANIX system. It matters not, for
    the purposes of this review, that I might not have come to the same conclusion.
    What is fatal to the Assistant Commissioner’s decision is his failure to
    consider whether the means required to produce the record were means “normally

'><span lang=EN-US>Reasonableness is a deferential standard animated by the principle that
    underlies the development of the two previous standards of reasonableness:
    certain questions that come before administrative tribunals do not lend
    themselves to one specific, particular result. Instead, they may give rise to a
    number of possible, reasonable conclusions. Tribunals have a margin of
    appreciation within the range of acceptable and rational solutions. A court
    conducting a review for reasonableness inquires into the qualities that make a
    decision reasonable, referring both to the process of articulating the reasons
    and to outcomes. In judicial review, reasonableness is concerned mostly with
    the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the
    decision-making process. But it is also concerned with whether the decision
    falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in
    respect of the facts and law (at para. 47).  <br>

    to the second issue of whether replacing the unique identifiers with unique,
    randomly-generated numbers constitutes “creating” a record, I again am of the
    view that the Adjudicator’s analysis and conclusion were reasonable. As I have
    already observed, the Adjudicator weighed the parties’ submissions and evidence
    in a transparent and reasoned manner. On this basis, he concluded that re-formatting
    information that already existed in a recorded form does not constitute
    “creating” a record.  This outcome
    reflects an acceptable approach in the factual and legal context of modern
    electronic record-keeping and falls squarely within one of a number of
    possible, reasonable conclusions. Accordingly, I would not give effect to the

    to consider whether the means required to produce the record were means normally

    to the Adjudicator by the parties in their submissions, the Adjudicator’s reasons
    indicate that he turned his mind to the question and that his decision on the

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First,
    the Adjudicator indicated twice in his reasons that his decision was based on a
    comprehensive reading of the definition of “record” contained in s. 2(1) of the
    Act. For example, in considering the questions raised by the parties, the Adjudicator
    stated that “it is necessary to review the wording of the definition as a whole”
    and he then set out the complete definition of the term “record” in s. 2(1).  In concluding that Mr. Rankin’s requests
    would not require the Board to create a new record, the Adjudicator repeated the
    need to review the wording of the definition as a whole, and he again set out
    the entirety of the provision.  It thus
    cannot be said that the Adjudicator failed to consider all of the language in
    the statutory definition.</span></p>

    the Adjudicator specifically addressed the Board’s evidence that the Police
    would be required to develop new software in order to replace unique
    identifiers with randomly-generated numbers. The Divisional Court failed to
    note the following significant passage in the Adjudicator’s reasons:  </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><i><span lang=EN-US>The affidavit of the Police suggests that it is possible to develop
    software which would replace a unique identifier with a random number. The
    Police’s concern that an algorithm would have to be specifically developed
    seems to me to be covered in the fees section of the Act (see section 6 of
    Regulation 823</span></i><span lang=EN-US>,
    which allows for fees for developing a computer program or other method of
    producing a record from machine readable record, and for the costs, including
    computer costs, that the institution incurs in locating, retrieving, processing
    and copying the record if those costs are specified in an invoice that the
    institution has received) (p.&nbsp;23). [Emphasis added.]</span></p>

    pause here to note that in his decision, the Adjudicator used the words </span>“computer
    program”, “software” and “algorithm” interchangeably. For present purposes, I
    am prepared to accept that those words share a common meaning. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Although
    the Adjudicator did not specifically address whether the means required to
    produce the record were means normally used by the institution, his reasons for
    decision indicate that he was aware the Police would need to develop a new
    algorithm or software and found that the Police’s concerns in this regard were
    addressed by the fees provisions in the Regulation enacted under the Act. In
    other words, he must be taken to have found that where the institution has the
    technical expertise, using its existing software, to develop a computer program
    to provide the requested information, that does not take the requested information
    outside the s. 2(1)(b) definition of record.  The Adjudicator could not fairly be expected to have given a more
    detailed analysis of this issue when it was not specifically put in issue
    before him.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is clear that the phrase “normally used by
    the institution” modifies the immediately preceding words “technical expertise”
    in s. 2(1)(b).  In my view, it is open to
    argument whether that phrase also modifies “computer hardware or software or
    other information storage equipment.” In the present case, the requested
    information can be extracted from the Police’s databases by developing an
    algorithm through the use of technical expertise and software that is normally
    used by the institution.  Thus, the
    requested information falls within the s. 2(1)(b) definition of record
    regardless of whether the phrase modifies “computer hardware or software”. It
    is not necessary to go on to decide the question whether the phrase “normally
    used by the institution” should be interpreted as precluding the need for an
    institution to acquire or purchase new software that is beyond its technical
    expertise to develop using its existing software. We would thus leave it to the
    Commissioner to decide that question in a future case, should it arise.  In the event that it does arise, the
    Commissioner will be free to construe the provision afresh.</p>

    third reason for concluding that the Adjudicator’s decision on the s. 2(1)(b)
    issue is not unreasonable is that the principles of statutory interpretation
    and the requirement that the Act be given a fair, large and liberal
    construction support the decision he reached. As recently held by this court in <i>City of Toronto Economic Development
    Corporation v. Information and Privacy Commissioner/Ontario</i> (2008), 292
    D.L.R. (4th) 706, at paras. 28 and 30, the Act should be given a broad
    interpretation to best ensure the attainment of its object, according to its true
    intent, meaning and spirit.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    accordance with this approach, any question of statutory interpretation must
    begin with a consideration of the purpose and intent of the legislation. Here,
    s. 1 of the Act takes the mystery out of that exercise. In particular, ss. 1(a)(i)
    and (ii) state that the purpose of the Act is to provide the public with a
    right of access to information under the control of municipal government
    institutions, in accordance with the principle that information should be made
    available subject only to limited and specified exemptions.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>That
    approach – one of presumptive access – reflects the fact that, because municipal
    institutions function to serve the public, they ought in general to be open to
    public scrutiny. In this regard, I agree with the submissions of the intervener
    that in enacting the Act, the legislature “wanted to improve the democratic
    process at the municipal and local board level” by ensuring members of the
    public would be able to access information needed “to participate in our
    democratic process in a worthwhile manner.” As noted by the intervener, the Act
    was advanced by the legislature as an “important step towards ensuring an open
    and very public operation of government at both the provincial and municipal
    levels”:

    these same lines, the Supreme Court of Canada has recognized that the
    overarching purpose of “access to information” legislation is to facilitate
    democracy. It does so in two ways – first, it helps to ensure that citizens have
    the information required to participate meaningfully in the democratic process
    and second, it helps ensure that politicians and bureaucrats remain accountable
    to the citizenry: <i>Dagg v. Canada

    hope to hold the government to account without having adequate knowledge of
    what government institutions are doing; nor can they hope to participate in the

    legislation if that process is hidden from view. It is fundamental to a healthy
    democracy that government processes be easily scrutinized by the very public the

    the result, I would allow the appeal and restore the order of the Adjudicator.
    The information being sought by Mr. Rankin exists in the two electronic
    databases controlled by the Police and the Police need not gather further
    information to fulfill his requests. Assuming that Mr. Rankin is willing to pay
    the costs prescribed by Reg. 823 in relation to developing the computer program
    needed to collate and anonymize the information he is seeking, the definition
    of “record” in s. 2(1)(b) presents no obstacle to his requests. Subject to any
    exemptions the Board may claim, steps should be taken immediately to respond to
    Mr. Rankin’s requests in accordance with the appropriate interpretation of s.
    2(1)(b).</span></p>

    payment of fees if in its opinion it would be fair and equitable to do so,
    having regard to several factors including: the actual cost of producing the
    record; whether access to the record is ultimately given; any financial
    hardship suffered by the requester; and whether production of the record will benefit
    public health or safety. Subsection 45(5) allows the Commission, upon request,
    to review an institution’s refusal to waive the applicable fees. I highlight
    these subsections only to make the point that the Act provides a mechanism by
    which requesters who cannot bear the financial burden of developing a new
    computer program or other computer costs may still obtain access to records.</span></p>
