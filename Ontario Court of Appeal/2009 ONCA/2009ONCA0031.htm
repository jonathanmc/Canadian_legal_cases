  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This Crown appeal concerns the conditional
    sentence imposed upon the respondent, Nauman Nusrat, after he pled guilty to
    criminal negligence causing death while street racing.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondent was street racing north on
    Highway 400 with two other young men when he cut off and struck a tractor-trailer
    driven by the victim, 48 year-old David Virgoe.  The collision caused the truck to strike another car before spinning off
    the highway and rolling into the ditch.  Mr. Virgoe was killed instantly.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondent pled guilty to criminal
    negligence causing death while street racing, as well as uttering a forged
    document and driving with no insurance. At the time of these offences, the
    respondent was 19 years old.  He had no
    criminal record, although he did have two prior convictions for speeding as well
    as convictions for failing to have an insurance card and valid licence
    plates.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For the crime of criminal negligence causing
    death while street racing, the respondent was sentenced to serve a conditional
    sentence of two years less a day, followed by two years’ probation, 140 hours
    of community service, a lifetime driving prohibition, a DNA order, and
    forfeiture of his automobile to the Crown.  In addition to the statutory terms, the conditional sentence included house
    arrest with exceptions for medical needs, employment, religious observance and
    school.  The respondent was also permitted to leave his residence
    every Saturday for four hours to attend to personal needs.  Fines were imposed for the offences of uttering
    a forged document and driving with no insurance.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown has appealed the sentence imposed for the criminal negligence conviction.  It is argued that the conditional sentence
    imposed is manifestly unfit and further, that the sentencing judge erred in
    principle by imposing a conditional sentence contrary to the principles in <i>R. v. Fice, </i>[2005] 1 S.C.R. 742, and <i>R.
    v. Proulx</i>, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 61. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For the
    reasons that follow, I would grant leave to appeal, allow the appeal and impose
    a sentence of 30 months. Taking into account credit for pre-sentence custody
    and the time the respondent has already served under the conditional sentence,
    the respondent has fully served that sentence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
page-break-after:avoid;'><b>(1)       The offences</b></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>During
    the morning rush hour traffic on June 18, 2007, the respondent and several
    friends decided to drive from the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto area to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Wasaga

    Beach.  They drove three cars, a Ford Mustang, a Honda Civic, and a Pontiac
    Grand Am, each with three passengers.  The Grand Am was driven by the respondent.  The group entered Highway 400 at Highway 401
    and the race began.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
page-break-after:avoid;'><b><i>(i)        The street race</i></b></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A number
    of people driving along the 400 were exposed to the driving associated with the
    race.  The agreed statement of facts that
    supported the guilty plea can be summarized as follows.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>One
    witness observed the Mustang just after the three cars started northbound on
    Highway 400.  The Mustang was opening its
    roof while travelling about 120 kilometres per hour.  The rear window shattered and then the
    Mustang slowed drastically, veering into the witness’s lane and forcing him to
    swerve to avoid collision. The Mustang then took off, quickly disappearing out
    of sight as it passed everyone on the road, cutting in and out of heavy
    traffic.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The same
    witness next saw the respondent’s Grand Am.  It approached in the passing lane at an estimated speed of 200
    kilometres per hour – double the speed the witness was travelling.  The respondent drove across all lanes, cutting
    in and out of traffic with smoke and dust flying, and was soon gone from sight.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Another
    witness described the extreme speed of the respondent’s Grand Am.  It came up very quickly behind her
    vehicle.  She estimated that the car
    passed at a speed of about 160 kilometres per hour.  It overtook several vehicles while weaving in
    and out of the passing and centre lanes of the 400.  At one point, the respondent’s vehicle hit
    the “rumble strip” on the left shoulder.  It almost went out of control but the respondent managed to move back
    into the left lane and take off.  The
    next thing this witness noticed was the Mustang on her right, overtaking her at
    a high rate of speed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent’s Grand Am and the Mustang cut off another witness as he entered the
    northbound lanes of the 400 from an on-ramp, forcing him to prepare for an
    emergency stop.  He observed the two
    vehicles zigzagging in and out of traffic.  He could tell they were cutting off other drivers from the brake lights of
    the cars ahead.  It was obvious that the
    drivers of the two cars knew each other because they were laughing and
    communicating with gestures and cutting each other off.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Several
    witnesses observed the drivers stopped on the shoulder of Highway 400 talking
    amongst themselves.  When the respondent’s
    Grand Am and the Civic re-entered the highway, they cut off another witness,
    forcing him, and the pick-up truck behind him, to brake to avoid
    collision.  Then the Mustang pulled out
    and passed the witness.  The cars began
    to criss-cross all three lanes of traffic apparently playing tag.  Many other cars were cut off and came very
    close to being hit.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Further
    north along the 400, the respondent attempted to overtake the two other racers
    and almost hit a tractor-trailer.  The
    witness thought the respondent was going to roll his car when he was forced to
    snap his car back into his own lane.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Other
    witnesses described how the vehicles would line up side by side as if drag
    racing, constantly cutting in and out of traffic with no regard for anyone.  The drivers and passengers were seen laughing
    as they cut off other vehicles. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
page-break-after:avoid;'><b><i>(ii)       The collision</i></b></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    terrorizing drivers and passengers travelling along the 400 for a distance of
    over 40 kilometres, the inevitable happened.  The luck of the racers, and those who had been endangered by them, ran
    out.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>One of
    the racers cut in front of a transport truck in heavy traffic and then passed
    Mr. Virgoe’s truck, just making it around on the right.  The respondent attempted the same manoeuvre in
    the gap between the trucks, but his car started to fishtail as he moved onto
    the right paved shoulder, travelling at an estimated speed of 160 kilometres
    per hour.  The left rear side of his car
    contacted the right front corner of Mr. Virgoe’s truck.  The respondent’s car began to rotate in a counter
    clockwise direction and was pushed along the road in front of the truck.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As a
    result of the impact, Mr. Virgoe lost control of his truck and veered into the
    left lane of the northbound 400, travelling in a north-westerly direction.  The truck struck a jeep travelling in the
    leftmost lane, pushing it into the steel guide rail.  Mr. Virgoe then steered sharply to the right.  The respondent’s car separated from the front
    of the truck and struck the steel guide rail, coming to rest 155 metres further
    northbound.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span> </span>Mr. Virgoe’s actions undoubtedly spared those
    who were southbound from head-on collisions with his tractor-trailer.  However, they caused his truck to swerve back
    across the northbound lanes and into the ditch below the grade of the highway.  His truck rolled over and came to rest on its
    roof, killing him in the process.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When his
    truck suddenly decelerated, Mr. Virgoe suffered a fatal head injury from the severe
    rotational and sheering force on his brain.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent remained at the scene.  When
    he saw that Mr. Virgoe was dead, he said “I killed a person.  I am a murderer”.  He was arrested at the scene and produced a
    forged insurance slip for his car.  The
    respondent remained in custody for 10 months before entering a plea of
    guilty.  He served a further 1 ½ months
    before being sentenced – a total of approximately 11 ½ months’ pre-sentence
    custody.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I would
    add that the respondent was a member of what can fairly be described as a
    street-racing subculture. Included in his interests listed on a webpage he
    maintained were speed, racing and cars.  Significantly, he posted a picture of himself posing in front of his car
    with the moniker “Nauman Aka Cut King (undefeated Champion)”.  “Cut King” has a particular meaning among
    street racers.  It refers to someone who
    cuts off other cars while racing. </p>

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;

    submissions of counsel</i></b><b><i></i></b></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In submissions as to sentence, the Crown argued for
    a sentence of 44 months followed by probation of two to three years.  The Crown recommended that the respondent receive
    credit for his pre-sentence custody on a two-for-one basis, and that he should
    be sentenced to a further two years in jail.  Crown counsel urged the court to take into account that racing on our
    highways is a serious problem and that incarceration is the appropriate
    response.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The defence argued that a fit sentence would be
    two years less a day, served conditionally, and that no credit should be given
    for pre-sentence custody.   In addition,
    the defence recommended that the sentence include three years’ probation with
    240 hours of community service work.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There was a joint submission for a lifetime
    driving prohibition, a DNA order, and a forfeiture of the respondent’s car to
    the Crown.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
page-break-after:avoid;'><b><i>(ii)       The
    reasons for sentence</i></b><b><i></i></b></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In his detailed reasons, the sentencing judge started
    with a review of the events leading up to the accident and noted that the
    respondent had been arrested at the scene and had been in custody ever
    since.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The sentencing judge then set out the positions
    of the parties.  In reviewing the
    arguments advanced, the sentencing judge noted the Crown’s submissions about
    the impact of the respondent’s conduct upon Mr. Virgoe, the Virgoe family and
    the community at large.  He further noted
    that the respondent had been convicted of speeding on two prior occasions, the
    most recent being just 12 days prior to the events giving rise to the fatal
    accident.<span style='font-size:14.0pt'>  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Turning to the defence submissions, the
    sentencing judge commented on the respondent’s youth and lack of previous
    involvement with the criminal justice system.  Further, he noted the respondent’s remorse and that it was the
    respondent’s idea to propose a lifetime driving ban. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The sentencing judge agreed with Crown counsel
    that the principles of general deterrence and denunciation were applicable in
    this case.  He proceeded to balance the
    relevant factors pertaining to the offender and the offence.  The analysis focused on the respondent’s
    antecedents, his youth and his remorse on the one hand and the importance of
    deterring street racing on the other.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The sentencing judge concluded that the
    principles of general deterrence and denunciation could be addressed within the
    framework of a conditional sentence, a sentence he imposed on the terms I have

    violated the principles outlined by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Fice</i>,<i> </i>in two respects.  First, the
    sentencing judge’s reasons demonstrate that he failed to decide upon the
    appropriate range of sentence before considering the possibility of a
    conditional sentence.  Essentially, he treated
    pre-sentence custody as a mitigating factor, rather than as a credit against
    the appropriate sentence.  Second, the

    sentence of imprisonment of less than two years” was intended to identify the
    type of offenders who could be entitled to a conditional sentence.  A conditional sentence is not available for
    offenders who should receive a penitentiary term, nor should it be imposed on
    offenders who would be entitled to a more lenient community sanction, such as a
    suspended sentence with probation.  This

    court outlined a two-stage analysis for determining whether an offender should
    be permitted to serve his or her sentence in the community.  At the first stage, the sentencing judge must
    make a preliminary determination of the appropriate range of sentence.  Where the preliminary determination excludes
    both probationary measures and a penitentiary term, and assuming the other
    statutory prerequisites are satisfied, the sentencing judge should proceed to
    the second stage of the analysis.  At the
    second stage, the sentencing judge will determine whether a conditional

    not be considered at the first stage of the analysis when the appropriate range
    of sentence is being considered.  Rather,
    pre-sentence custody should only be considered at the second stage of the
    inquiry, after it is determined at the first stage that a sentence in the

    which the sentencing judge went on to consider at paras. 32-35, as follows:  </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="HeadingNumber" style="line-height:normal;">The Crown’s position is not supported by the facts of this
      case.  The guilty plea, the fact that Mr.
      Nusrat has no prior record, and that he is a first time youthful offender, are
      factors, which undermine the Crown’s position.  I also believe his remorse is genuine and will be rehabilitated.  As I have already stated I do not believe I
      can substitute street racing for alcohol.  Mr. Nusrat was not consuming alcohol nor was he under the influence of
      any illicit drugs. </p>
    <p class="HeadingNumber" style="line-height:normal;">In arriving at the proper sentence, the courts are required
      to balance several factors, which include the conduct of the offender as well
      as the consequences of the offence.  </p>
    <p class="HeadingNumber" style="line-height:normal;"><i>In this case I have
      taken into account that Mr. Nusrat has pleaded guilty, that he has no previous
      convictions, that he is very remorseful</i> <i>and
        that he has spent 11 </i>[<i>sic</i>,<i> </i>11 ½ months?] <i>months in pre-sentence custody</i>.  I have balanced these factors against the very aggressive driving, the
      high rate of speed on a busy highway, the extended driving distance and the
      fact that this was not a spontaneous event.  I also do so in the context of Mr. Nusrat’s age. </p>
    <p class="HeadingNumber" style="line-height:normal;">On the basis of all the evidence before me, I have concluded
      that he does not need to be specifically deterred.  I do not believe, based on the way he has

    appropriate sanctions.  Indeed, at para.
    34, the sentencing judge included pre-sentence custody in the same sentence where
    he listed the various mitigating factors.  There is no indication that the sentencing judge considered a lower range
    penitentiary sentence or even that a sentence in the reformatory range was

    <p class="HeadingNumber" style="line-height:normal;">…</p>
    <p class="HeadingNumber" style="line-height:normal;">Since
      the time spent in pre-sentence custody is part of the total punishment imposed,

    determining an appropriate sentence, the court must consider not only the
    circumstances of the offence, but also the circumstances of the offender.  This case-specific nature of sentencing is evident
    in the fundamental sentencing principle of proportionality under the <i>Criminal Code</i>: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="HeadingNumber" style="line-height:normal;">s. 718.1 <span style='color:black'>A sentence must be
      proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of
      the offender</span>.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In my view, the sentence in this case should be
    one that sends a strong message to the general public, and to those who are
    members of the so-called street racing subculture, that street racing will not
    be tolerated.  Having regard to the
    seriousness of the offence and its catastrophic consequences, the objectives of
    general deterrence and denunciation must be paramount.<span>  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While the respondent did not intend to cause Mr.
    Virgoe’s death, he deliberately engaged in egregious racing behaviour over an
    extended distance on a busy highway.  The
    potential for tragedy was high, if not inevitable.  In these circumstances, I agree with the comments of Doherty J.A. in <i>R. v. Hamilton </i>(2004), 72 O.R. (3d) 1 (
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>

  <blockquote>
    <p class="HeadingNumber" style="line-height:normal;">[F]actors mitigating personal responsibility
      cannot justify a disposition that unduly minimizes the seriousness of the crime
      committed.  </p>
    <p class="HeadingNumber" style="line-height:normal;">…</p>
    <p class="HeadingNumber" style="line-height:normal;">In some circumstances, one side of the
      proportionality inquiry will figure more prominently in the ultimate
      disposition than the other.</p>

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Where
    the offender’s conduct results in serious personal injury or death, the gravity
    of the offence must be given predominance in determining the appropriate
    sentence. </p>

'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent entered into an agreement with other thrill seekers to race along a
    busy highway – taking the life of one and risking the lives of many.  This conduct evidences a deliberate
    endangerment of other users of the road and carries with it a high level of
    moral blameworthiness.  In my view, where
    persons such as the respondent engage in intentional risk taking of this nature
    and duration, and with such horrific consequences, they should expect to face a
    substantial period of incarceration.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the light of the seriousness of the offence
    in this case, I am of the view that a penitentiary range sentence was essential
    to adequately address the paramount sentencing purposes of denunciation and
    general deterrence.  Although involving a
    drinking and driving offence, the comments of this court in <i>R. v. McVeigh</i> (1985), 22 C.C.C. (3d)
    145, at p. 150 would seem appropriate: “The public should not have to wait until members of the public are
    killed before the courts’ repudiation of the conduct that led to the killing is
    made clear.”  Like every drunk driver,
    every street racer is a potential killer.  The respondent turned this potential into a
    reality.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>  <i> </i>With
    appropriate emphasis on the circumstances surrounding the offence and the
    gravity of its consequences, and taking into account the circumstances of the
    offender, I am of the view that an appropriate sentence in this case would be
    one of 30 months in jail.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I see no principled reason for refusing to give
    the respondent credit for pre-sentence custody on the usual two-for-one
    basis.  Since the respondent served approximately
    10 months of pre-sentence custody prior to his plea of guilty, and a further 1 ½
    months before he was sentenced, he should be given 23 months of credit against
    the 30 month custodial sentence, leaving a further 7 months to serve.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I am left with the question of whether the
    respondent should be sent to jail at this stage.  He has already served just over 7 months of
    his conditional sentence.  There is no
    suggestion that he has not complied with its terms.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This court has consistently held that
    reincarceration itself imposes additional hardship on an offender and as such
    has been reluctant to reincarcerate unless the sentence is grossly inadequate
    and the interests of justice require the court’s intervention:  see <i>R.
    v. Cheng</i> (1991), 50 O.A.C. 374.  In
    all of the circumstances, I see no useful purpose in reincarcerating the respondent.  </p>

    appeal.  I would impose a sentence of 30
    months.  Having regard to the credit to which
    the respondent is entitled on a two-for-one basis for his pre-sentence custody
    (23 months), I would have imposed a further custodial sentence of 7
    months.  However, the respondent is
    entitled to credit for the 7 months he has served on his conditional sentence.  Thus, the respondent has effectively served
    the sentence I would have imposed.  Consequently, the appropriate order is that the sentence is varied to
    one of time served, to be followed by the two year term of probation.  The lifetime driving prohibition and the
    other orders imposed by the sentencing judge remain the same.   </p>
