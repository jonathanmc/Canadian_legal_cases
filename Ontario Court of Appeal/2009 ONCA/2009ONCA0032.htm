    assault, invitation to sexual touching, and sexual interference, by a judge
    sitting with a jury. On November 6, 2006 he was sentenced to four years in
    custody, less seven months credit given for pre-trial custody. The offences
    were committed on his daughter who was four years old at that time. He has been
    on judicial interim release pending this appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I conclude that the expert, called by the Crown to
    offer the opinion that the complainant had suffered sexual assault, was allowed
    to give testimony that indicated to the jury his views of the veracity of the

    children of the appellant and his common-law wife. In March of 2003 the
    Children’s Aid Society removed the children from their parents’ home for
    reasons unrelated to the charges against the appellant. After six months in a
    foster home, on September 17, 2003 the complainant disclosed first to her
    foster father and then to her foster mother that she had been sexually abused
    by her “Daddy”. The foster parents took her to the police and on September 23
    and 24, 2003 she provided two video statements outlining the allegations of
    sexual abuse by her father. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The complainant’s father was charged with the
    offences noted above. Though initially represented by one counsel and then
    another, he was unrepresented at trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Crown, instead of calling the complainant as a
    witness, sought to adduce the statements she made to her foster parents and to
    the police as proof of the truth of their contents under the principles of <i>R. v. Khan</i> [1990] 2 S.C.R. 531. On its
    application, the Crown called Dr. Wehrspann, who was qualified as an expert in
    child sexual abuse and related trauma. The Crown called Dr. Wehrspann to
    address the complainant’s inability to testify as well as to establish that her
    statements met the threshold of reliability to be admitted for the truth of
    their contents. The Crown also called both the foster parents to recount how
    and what the complainant disclosed to them, and the police officer who took the
    complainant’s video statements. The trial judge granted the Crown’s application.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Later, when during the course of the <span lang=EN-US>trial</span> it became apparent that the Crown
    did not intend to call Dr. Wehrspann as a witness at the trial itself, the
    trial judge directed the Crown to call him. She explained that she saw all the
    evidence called on the <i>voir dire </i>as
    one package and had ruled on it as a package. Before Dr. Wehrspann testified
    the trial judge, in his presence, set certain parameters for his testimony. She
    instructed that he could testify about the complainant’s inability to testify
    and also “about the reliability of her utterances to third parties”. He could
    give his opinion on whether the complainant had been sexually abused but “[h]e
    may not say who, in his opinion the sexual abuser is.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Wehrspann explained in his testimony that he was
    unable to engage the complainant in a discussion of the allegations. His
    testimony and opinion was based primarily on his review of the Children’s Aid
    Society’s file that contained the reports of the complainant’s foster parents
    to the Society. He does not seem to have viewed the complainant’s video
    statements to the police as he made no reference to them. Dr. Wehrspann’s
    personal observations of the complainant were that she had become fearful and
    had gone white when he first asked her about her father, and that at a
    subsequent interview, she had become distracted and refused to be engaged when
    he tried to get her to talk about what she had disclosed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Wehrspann indicated that he looks at four different
    areas in assessing whether a child’s disclosure of sexual abuse has validity or
    not:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="MsoListNumber4CxSpFirst">1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>whether another adult in the environment promoted or
      encouraged the child’s disclosure;  </p>
    <p class="MsoListNumber4CxSpMiddle">2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>whether
      the child’s disclosure is expressed from a child’s perspective;</p>
    <p class="MsoListNumber4CxSpMiddle">3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>whether
      the child exhibits inappropriate sexual behaviour; and</p>
    <p class="MsoListNumber4CxSpMiddle">4.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
      emotional health of the child. </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After discussing the evidence relevant to each of these
    areas, Dr. Wehrspann stated his final conclusions within the parameters set by
    the trial judge. He testified that his expert recommendation was that the
    complainant should not testify at the trial and that it was his expert opinion
    that she had been sexually abused. He refrained from expressly identifying the
    appellant as the perpetrator of the sexual abuse.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In explaining his views and offering his opinions, Dr.
    Wehrspann made clear that he accepted the foster parents’ reports as true. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant presented a defence. He testified,
    adamantly denying all the allegations. He called several witnesses, including
    the complainant’s mother and a family services worker and a children’s services
    worker with the Children’s Aid Society, who all testified that there were no
    concerns of sexual abuse prior to the allegations being made. The theories of
    the appellant put forward in his defence were that the police were out to get
    him, that the foster parents had put these ideas in the complainant’s head, and
    that it was the foster father who had abused the complainant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In her charge to the jury, the trial judge reminded the
    jury that Dr. Wehrspann had only given the opinion that the child had been
    sexually abused and had not expressed an opinion as to who had abused her.
    Following this instruction, she immediately reminded the jury that Dr.
    Wehrspann had expressed the opinion that the complainant was afraid of her
    father. </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the appellant raises several grounds of appeal, I
    find it necessary to discuss only one - the appellant’s contention that the
    trial judge erred by admitting the opinion evidence of Dr. Wehrspann. The
    appellant submits that Dr. Wehrspann strayed outside the boundaries of
    permissible expert testimony by indicating he believed the out of court
    statements of the complainant and the foster parents. I agree.</p>
  <h3>Analysis</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The most helpful case regarding the admissibility and
    ambit of an expert’s opinion as to whether a child has suffered sexual abuse is <i>Khan v. College of Physicians and
    Surgeons of Ontario</i> (1992), 9 O.R. (3d) 641 (O.C.A.). This case presents
    the opportunity to repeat and expand upon the principles stated in that case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Khan v. College
    of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario</i> arose out of disciplinary proceedings
    against Dr. Khan before the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    College
    of
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Physicians and
    Surgeons of Ontario for the sexual assault of a patient, then 3 1/2 years old.
    One of the issues on the appeal was whether the two expert witnesses who had
    testified at Dr. Khan’s hearing had gone beyond the scope of what was
    permissible by giving their opinions on the ultimate issue to be decided by the
    tribunal. Doherty J.A. reviewed the law and stated the following general
    principles.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, expert evidence is not rendered inadmissible
    simply because it may bear on the very factual issue to be decided by the trier
    of fact. Second, an expert witness may not offer an opinion as to the veracity
    of any witness, except in very exceptional cases. Third, expert opinion as to
    what factual inferences or conclusions should be drawn from the evidence concerning
    the “behaviour and symptomatology” of a child is admissible even though it
    indirectly enhances the credibility of the child’s evidence. Fourth, the trial
    judge may control the format in which the expert evidence is given by excluding
    an expert’s conclusory statements where the expert is able to express the
    opinion in less conclusory terms without detracting from its accuracy. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These principles, taken together, allow the Crown to
    present expert evidence that will assist the trier of fact while protecting the
    accused from the trier of fact placing undue weight on the expert’s opinion.
    There exists, however, potential tension between the second and third
    principles. The second principle is that the expert is not permitted to express
    an opinion about the veracity of any witness. Despite this, the third principle
    states that the expert is permitted to offer an opinion (based on the child’s “behaviour
    and symptomatology”) that the child has been sexually abused even though it “indirectly
    enhances the credibility of the child’s evidence.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The third principle qualifies but does not annul the
    second principle. While the scope permitted an expert witness by the third
    principle is broad, the court should be vigilant in ensuring that the expert in
    expressing his or her opinions does not violate the second. As Doherty J.A.
    noted in <i>Khan v. College of Physicians
    and Surgeons of Ontario</i>, though there is strong value and need for evidence
    in cases of child sexual abuse, a trier of fact “[f]aced with the often
    intractable problem of trying to decide who is telling the truth in cases of
    alleged child abuse ... may seek refuge in the apparent security and
    objectivity of the expert’s opinion evidence.” Major J. made much the same
    observation in <i>R. v. D. (D)</i>, [2000] 2
    S.C.R. 275 at para. 53, that there is a danger that “faced with an expert’s
    impressive credentials and mastery of scientific jargon, jurors are more likely
    to abdicate their role as fact-finders and simply attorn to the opinion of the
    expert in their desire to reach a just result.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning back to this case, I do not accept that the
    subject matter which Dr. Wehrspann addressed strayed outside the broad range
    permitted by the third principle. The scope of the child’s “behaviour and
    symptomatology” is not narrowly limited to the psychological, social and physical
    traits. It includes the child’s verbal behaviour. Verbal behaviour may include
    the fact that the child makes reports of being involved in sexual activity or
    that the child makes such reports without prompting. It may also include the
    particular vocabulary the child uses in making those reports.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Wehrspann noted that the complainant was observed
    at the daycare with her mouth on the penis of a little boy, that she
    masturbated frequently and was not private about it, and that she was indiscriminate
    in her attachments in that she would go up to anybody and make physical contact
    with them. In addition, Dr. Wehrspann’s opinion was also based on his view of
    the complainant’s verbal behaviour. It was important to his analysis that the
    complainant did report sexual activity, she made these reports without
    prompting, and that she described the sexual activity in age appropriate
    language. These are all matters of the complainant’s “behaviour and
    symptomatology”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Properly elicited expert opinion based on such matters
    is admissible even though it may indirectly enhance the credibility of the
    child witness or of the witnesses who testify about the child’s disclosure. The
    problem here is that Dr. Wehrspann’s opinions were not properly elicited and
    the effect of his evidence was to indicate his views of the veracity of the
    complainant and the foster parents. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As noted, Dr. Wehrspann’s opinion was primarily on his
    review of the Children’s Aid Society’s file that contained the reports of her
    foster parents to the Society. The only matters he could address directly were
    his observation that when he tried to talk to the complainant about her father
    she became fearful immediately and that she was too open and indiscriminate in her
    attachments to adults she did not know. His analysis, however, was based
    primarily on the material in the Children’s Aid Society file, which included, notably,
    the reports from the complainant’s foster parents, the veracity of which were disputed
    by the defence<i>.</i> </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To illustrate I need only set out an excerpt of Dr.
    Wehrspann’s testimony regarding whether an adult in the environment had
    promoted or encouraged the complainant’s disclosure. That the complainant’s
    disclosure had been made spontaneously was important to Dr. Wehrspann’s opinion
    that she had been sexually abused. He testified:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            A. … when I looked at the material from the C.A.S., I
    thought that the reports from [the foster mother and the foster father]were
    very significant because … I didn’t feel … that with either one of them … they
    were thinking beforehand that she had been sexually abused and they were
    looking for it. I think that they came upon it and when they came upon it,
    there wasn’t … any promoting or influencing or wanting the child to reveal. I
    think the material … from [the complainant] was quite spontaneous.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            Q. Can you give us some examples?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            A. Yes. On September 17th, 2003 [the complainant] talked
    to [the foster mother and the foster father] regarding events between her and –
    and her dad. The events were of a sexual nature. And there’s no mention prior
    in any notes from the [the foster parents] that they were looking for this and
    this was also confirmed … by [the CAS worker], who didn’t feel that either of
    the parents were thinking or wanting to promote the sexual abuse.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            Q. This is the foster parents?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            A.
    Yes. And [the foster father’s] reaction was one of shock and he said, “All I
    can say is that” – I mean, he cried, which is – I don’t know if he cries all
    the time. But, I mean, it is a significant, immediate response that he cried.
    And he said, “All I can say is that I think I am now going to go and throw up.”
    So, I mean… I think it was a visceral reaction to him hearing the material that
    he did. … I would say that supports the idea that … he wasn’t promoting a
    disclosure of sexual abuse. Spontaneous – I mean, with [the complainant], I
    mean, he came upon her masturbating and she brought up the idea … of her father
    and she brought up the idea of being peed on and she brought up the idea that
    the pee was different and she brought up the idea of the pee being put on her.
    And she also said she was told to keep it a secret. So, all those things – I
    mean, those things didn’t come from - from [the foster father]. Those came from
    the child. And I would say that argues – that would argue for … the validity of
    a sexual abuse allegation, that it was more spontaneous and we don’t find any
    adult in the environment promoting it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As this passage shows, Dr. Wehrspann not only made it clear
    that he accepted the foster parents’ reports as true, but also that he
    forcefully used the veracity of those reports to drive his analysis. For
    example, in this passage he reasoned that the fact the foster father was
    shocked by the disclosure was an indication that the foster father had not
    promoted it. No fault can be found with Dr. Wehrspann’s reasoning from his
    factual premise. The fault is that he treated his factual premise as
    established fact. The whole of his testimony in chief is in a similar vein.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The cross examination of Dr. Wehrspann by the
    unrepresented appellant is revealing. After establishing that the doctor did
    not have any physical evidence of the complainant having been sexually abused,
    the appellant put to him that his opinion was based on the reports of the
    foster parents. Instead of acknowledging this was so, Dr. Wehrspann responded “I’m
    – I’m arguing that what – what Samantha disclosed to the foster parents is --
    is a powerful argument that she’s been sexually abused.” With respect to the
    doctor, that is the nub of the problem. Much of his testimony was argument. At
    one point he started asking the appellant questions, in effect cross examining
    him, pointing out that he had used the word “puddie” in his question. Dr.
    Wehrspann asked the appellant “who taught her that?” The clear intent of this
    question was to incriminate the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Throughout his testimony, Dr. Wehrspann treated his
    factual premises as established fact, contended in favour of his factual
    premises, and, in recounting the reports of the foster parents, freely
    identified the appellant as the perpetrator. In so doing, Dr. Wehrspann strayed
    beyond the role of an expert witness. His role was to assist the trier of fact
    to appreciate that certain matters of behaviour and symptomatology, which the
    crown alleged the complainant exhibited, would be consistent with sexual abuse.
    Whether the complainant did in fact exhibit the alleged behaviour and
    symptomatology depended on the testimony of other witnesses, principally the
    foster parents. It was not the expert’s role to indicate his view whether their
    testimony or out of court statements were credible and reliable. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr. Wehrspann’s testimony clearly went beyond
    expressing an opinion based on the complainant’s behaviour and symptomatology.
    His testimony would have left no doubt in the jury’s mind that he believed the
    Crown’s witnesses and disbelieved the appellant in arriving at his opinion that
    the complainant suffered sexual abuse. His testimony, in effect, directly
    addressed the credibility and reliability of other witnesses. As such it
    violated the second principle stated in <i>Khan
    v. College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario</i>. I would hold the trial
    judge erred in admitting it and that a new trial is necessary.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This result could have been avoided had trial judge
    required that Dr. Wehrspann’s testimony be elicited by hypothetical questions
    that incorporated all of the factual premises upon which his opinion was based.
    Properly framed hypothetical questions would have permitted Dr. Wehrspann to
    draw upon the foster parents’ reports of the circumstances, manner and content
    of complainant’s disclosure while leaving to the jury the task of deciding
    whether or not to believe them. This was especially important in this case as
    the defence attempted to implicate the foster father in the abuse and suggest
    that both foster parents helped concoct the allegations against him. The use of
    hypothetical questions would have properly confined the expert testimony while emphasizing
    to the jury its responsibility to determine the facts. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Failure to require the use of the hypothetical question
    technique to elicit the opinion evidence of experts may not constitute
    reversible error in all circumstances. However, where, as here, the facts on
    which the expert’s opinion is based are in dispute it should have been used.
    The fact that the theory of the defence may not be apparent at the time a Crown
    expert testifies makes it a wise practice in all cases. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where the hypothetical question technique is not used,
    careful instructions to the jury may be able to repair the situation. In this
    case, the trial judge’s instructions to the jury did little to alleviate the
    problem. The trial judge did tell the jury that Dr. Wehrspann had only given
    the opinion that the child had been sexually abused and had not expressed an
    opinion as to who had abused her. However, she then immediately reminded the
    jury that Dr. Wehrspann had expressed the opinion that the complainant was
    afraid of her father. This would have reinforced in the jury’s mind that Dr.
    Wehrspann had much to contribute to the identification of the abuser. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I add a remark about Dr. Wehrspann’s testimony at the <i>voir dire</i>. The Crown did not use
    hypothetical questions to elicit his opinion evidence at the <i>voir dire </i>as it should have. However, at
    the <i>voir dire </i>the trial judge
    accepted the foster parents’ and police officer’s testimony thus providing a
    factual basis for Dr. Wehrspann’s opinions. The trial judge’s reasons
    demonstrate she drew on the general factors that Dr. Wehrspann identified, but
    arrived at her own conclusions regarding the factual premises from the other
    evidence called. Dr. Wehrspann’s testimony, as she explained, was part of a
    package that supported her conclusion that the complainant’s out of court
    statements possessed threshold reliability. His uncontradicted testimony that
    the complainant would be traumatized if called to testify and that she would be
    put at risk of permanent damage sustained her conclusion the necessity
    requirement was satisfied. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While there is no merit in the appellant’s criticism of
    the trial judge’s decision to admit the complainant’s out-of-court statements,
    I repeat that the preferred approach is to require the use of the hypothetical
    question technique to elicit expert opinion whenever the facts may be
    contested. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Conclusion</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would allow the appeal on the ground that the trial
    judge erred by permitting Dr. Wehrspann to indicate a clear and impermissible
    view of the veracity of other witnesses. This was largely a result of her
    failure to require the Crown to use hypothetical questions in eliciting the
    expert’s opinion evidence. This error resulted in the trial being unfair. I
    would set aside the convictions and remit the charges to the Superior Court to
    be retried. </p>
