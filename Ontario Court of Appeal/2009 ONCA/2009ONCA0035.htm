  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sergeant Steven Tedford was patrolling on the afternoon
    of December 30, 2004 when he received a radio call.  According to a 911 caller, there was a
    robbery in progress at a gas station.  The scene of the crime was just around the corner.  Tedford rushed there with his lights and
    siren on.  In the few seconds Tedford
    needed to get to the scene, the radio dispatcher gave him a description of the
    robber.  When Tedford arrived at the gas
    station, he saw a man who shared most of the robber’s distinguishing
    traits.  That man – the respondent – was
    running away from the scene of the robbery.  With nobody else on the street, Tedford was sure he had found the
    robber.  After a very short pursuit,
    Tedford arrested the respondent, searched him and found 34 grams of crack
    cocaine in his pocket.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the respondent’s trial, blended with a <i>Charter voir dire</i>, Sergeant Tedford was
    the only witness.  The admissibility of
    the crack cocaine was the only issue.  In
    her ruling, the trial judge excluded the crack.  She concluded that the respondent’s section 8 and 9 <i>Charter</i> rights were breached by Tedford and that the admission of
    the drugs would bring the administration of justice into disrepute.  Without that crucial evidence of the
    respondent’s guilt, he was acquitted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant contends that the appeal should be
    allowed because the trial judge erred in her analysis of the respondent’s
    section 8 and 9 <i>Charter</i> rights.  In particular, she erred by concluding that
    Tedford’s grounds to arrest the respondent were not objectively
    reasonable.  The appellant’s position is
    that there were ample grounds to justify the respondent’s arrest and the search
    incidental to the arrest.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We agree.  In <i>R. v. Lawes</i>, 2007 ONCA 10 at para. 4,
    this court said that “[t]he totality of the circumstances relied upon by the
    arresting officer will form the basis for the objective assessment.”  In this case, the totality of the circumstances
    strongly supports the officer’s decision to detain and arrest the
    respondent.  The officer was told that
    there was a robbery in progress at the gas station.  Within about a minute, he was at the site and
    saw a person, running away from the station.  When the officer first observed the runner, he was about 20-25 metres
    from the station.  The description he had
    been given was: male, black, wearing a blue hat and blue jeans, 39-40 years
    old, 5’ 7” tall and 240 pounds.  The
    person he spotted running away from the gas station was: male, black, wearing a
    black baseball cap, blue jeans and a black leather jacket, 38 years old, 5’ 9”
    tall and 160 pounds.  Of these six
    factors, five are either identical or very similar and one (weight) is
    spectacularly different.  In our view, in
    “the totality of the circumstances”, including a robbery scenario, a man
    running from the scene, and elapsed time of about a minute, the single
    significant difference between the radioed description of the potential robber
    and the description of the man Tedford saw running from the scene is not enough
    to render the detention and arrest objectively unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge stated two main reasons for finding the
    detention and arrest objectively unreasonable: (1) the five identical or
    similar factors are generic and apply to thousands of people; and (2) in light
    of the weight discrepancy, Tedford should have entered the gas station to
    confirm that the robber was no longer there.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect, we do not regard these points as
    controlling.  It is true that the five
    identical or similar factors are generic in the sense that they apply to many
    people.  However, in this case the
    potential application of these factors is hugely reduced – to be precise, to
    one – by the singular fact that there was only one person the officer saw when
    he arrived at the scene and that person was running away from an alleged robbery
    site.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor do we think that the weight discrepancy required
    Tedford to stop his chase and enter the gas station to ascertain if the robber
    was still there.  In light of the timing
    (about a minute) and the situation (a man running from the scene), the officer
    was entitled to continue the chase of the suspect he saw in front of him.  The determination of whether the officer had
    reasonable grounds must be made in the context of the circumstances presented
    to the officer.  In this case, the
    circumstances included a fleeing suspect.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appeal is allowed and a new trial is ordered.</p>
