    August 2004, Graham Allen mentioned to his friend and neighbour, Kim Wallace
    that he wanted to sell his business, Region of Huronia Environmental Services
    Limited (“Region”) and retire.  Wallace
    expressed an interest in acquiring the business.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
    September 24, 2004, after weeks of negotiation and discussion, the parties
    executed a document which they described as “a letter of intent for the share
    purchase and the sale of the following companies”.  There followed a list of the four companies
    of which Graham Allen and his wife Gayle were the major shareholders.  Both parties acknowledged that all of the
    terms they considered necessary or essential to the transaction were agreed
    upon that day and included in the agreement.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
    September 27 and thereafter, Wallace began to attend the business premises
    daily with a view to learning the business, getting to know the customers and
    staff, and doing everything necessary to provide a smooth transition in the
    ownership of the business from Allen to Wallace.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
    December 6, 2004 Wallace’s solicitor, John Nichols, sent a proposed first draft
    of a Share Purchase Agreement to John Cockburn, solicitor for Allen.  Mr. Cockburn prepared a lengthy, detailed
    memorandum of issues he considered necessary to address.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
    December 9, 2004 the parties, their solicitors and Allen’s accountant met for
    the purpose of finalizing the specific terms of the Share Purchase
    Agreement.  The trial judge found that
    all issues raised between the parties that were intended to form part of the
    final Share Purchase Agreement were resolved and agreed to at that meeting, or
    at the very latest, within a day or two thereof.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

    December 29, 2004 was selected as a target date for closing, as the trial judge
    found, time was not of the essence.</span></p>

    Allen and his solicitor were in attendance and prepared to close the
    transaction on December 29, Wallace did not attend on that date.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There
    was evidence that Wallace had gone to
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Florida
    to be with his family and did so with Allen’s knowledge, approval and indeed,
    encouragement.  When Wallace did not
    appear on December 29, Allen treated the transaction as at an end and refused
    to close the deal or to propose an alternative date for closing and making time
    of the essence in relation to that new date.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US> Wallace sued for specific performance and the
    trial judge dismissed his action, essentially finding that the parties did not
    intend that there be a binding contractual relationship until the final Share
    Purchase Agreement was signed.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For
    the reasons that follow I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment
    dismissing the action with costs, and in its place grant judgment in favour of
    Wallace for damages and costs.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    the weeks after Wallace first told Allen he would be interested in purchasing
    Allen’s business, the parties worked hard at negotiating an agreement.  During these negotiations, Wallace presented
    two draft Letters of Intent to Allen, which he refused to sign because as he
    put it: “there remained too many things up in the air”.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
    September 23, 2004 the parties and their accountants met with a view to
    finalizing the outstanding issues.  The
    sticking point at that time was Allen’s requirement that Wallace provide a
    letter of credit to secure his obligations.  Wallace refused to do so but offered a limited personal guarantee.  The following day after Gayle Allen met with
    the Allens’ solicitor and taken legal advice on the issue of the letter of
    credit  as against a personal guarantee,
    the parties again met to discuss a further draft letter of intent prepared by
    Wallace.  They also discussed a number of
    other matters not addressed in the letter of intent, including Graham Allen’s personal
    tools and pick-up truck, Gayle Allen’s Hummer, and Allen’s motor home, all of
    which were thought to be assets of the business.  Both parties agreed they reached agreement
    that day on all matters contained in the Letter of Intent, as well as on the
    additional items that were to be turned over to the Allens on closing “free and
    clear”.  That is to say, both parties
    acknowledged that all of the terms they considered necessary or essential to
    the transaction were agreed upon on September 24, 2004.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Wallace’s
    evidence was that he told Allen he would not work in the business without a
    binding agreement.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Wallace’s
    intention, shared with Allen, was to bring his friend Ralph Nelson into the
    business right away.  Nelson at the time
    had secure employment elsewhere.  For
    Wallace it was necessary he and Allen have a firm deal before he could ask
    Nelson to leave a secure job and come to work at Region.  Nelson started to work with Region in early
    October 2004.  In November 2004, Wallace
    bought a home in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Orillia
    for his son David, who was also going to be involved in the business.</span></p>

    two weeks of signing the letter of intent, the Allens held a special employee
    meeting where he announced his retirement and the fact that he had “sold” his
    company and that the “deal was solid”.  Allen then turned the floor over to Wallace who spoke to the employees.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

    the company Christmas party in late November 2004, Allen, as he had throughout
    the fall of 2004, introduced Wallace to employees, customers and business
    contacts as the “new owner” of Region. Thereafter Wallace spoke to all those in
    attendance.</span></p>

    acknowledged that when he entered his solicitor’s office on the morning of
    December 29, 2004, he considered himself bound to the transaction and obliged
    to complete it.  He was there to sign the
    necessary paperwork and he had arranged for the two minority shareholders,
    Laird Hollingshead and Clarence McGillivary, to be present for signing as well.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>When
    a telephone call to Wallace’s solicitor disclosed that Wallace had not signed
    the necessary closing documentation and that there was no money in trust to
    close the transaction (which was an error; the money was in fact, in Mr.
    Nichols trust account), Allen decided he would not close the transaction.  Despite repeated entreaties by Wallace over
    the days following, the Allens refused to complete the transaction. This action
    followed.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    trial judge fixed the plaintiff’s damages at $240,000, representing the loss of
    financial benefit to Wallace for the first three months that he would have
    operated the business had the transaction closed in a timely way.  The trial judge found Wallace had mitigated
    his damages within the three month period by using the $300,000 earmarked as
    the down payment for the Allen transaction to purchase his partner’s interest
    in a marina business.  Wallace’s evidence
    was that he had ample resources to fund both deals and would in fact have done
    so.  His statement of net worth, filed in
    evidence (contrary to the trial judge’s finding) and unchallenged at trial,
    corroborated his ability to do so.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant raises five grounds of appeal.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>            1.         Did the
    learned trial judge err in determining that the parties did not intend to create legal relations in entering into the Letter of Intent?</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge erred in law in determining that the
    parties did not intend to be bound by the Letter of Intent.  It is submitted that the trial judge failed
    to apply the presumption in law that one who executes a commercial document
    intends to be bound thereby, and that her construction of the Letter of Intent
    defeated the expectations of the parties and was contrary to the overwhelming
    weight of the evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    my view the appellant’s submissions are sound.  When read as a whole, the document, the Letter of Intent dated September
    24, 2004, evidences the intention of the parties to be bound.  The critical clauses in the Letter of Intent,
    which contemplate a further agreement are clear and unambiguous.  Those clauses read:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>IT
    IS ALSO AGREED BY THE PARTIES THAT THERE WILL BE MUCH LEGAL WORK TO BE DONE
    UPON ACCEPTANCE BY BOTH SIDES AND THAT THE WORDING OF THIS AGREEMENT MAY ALTER
    SOMEWHAT</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-US>and</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>THIS
    LETTER OF INTENT MUST BE REDUCED INTO A BINDING AGREEMENT OF PURCHASE AND

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Both
    clauses contemplate that it is the wording of “this” agreement (not some other
    agreement) that “may alter somewhat” and “must be reduced into a binding
    agreement of purchase and sale” – and only the wording, not the substance.  I agree with the appellant that the document
    plainly expressed an intention on the part of the parties to be bound by the
    terms of the Letter of Intent, which terms were to be incorporated into a more
    formal document.  The Letter of Intent
    was prepared by Wallace who had had some prior experience in share/purchase
    agreements.  Wallace was asked to comment
    on the reference to “much legal work to be done” and the contemplation of a
    further agreement between the parties.  He explained as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>…
    A three or four page agreement in fact needed to become twenty or fifty pages
    or whatever. The details of, of this agreement needed to be spelled out and, you

    the terms of this agreement.</span></p>

  good faith?</h3>

    deal with this third issue.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>            4.         Did the learned trial judge err in law
  in rejecting the remedy of specific performance?</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    appellant submits as a matter of law where the object of the contract is
    unique, specific performance is the appropriate remedy, absent some good reason
    to the contrary.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    argument can be made that every business is unique.  The appellant is an entrepreneur engaged in
    the acquisition of businesses.  His own
    evidence discloses that he has experience in the sale and purchase of shares of
    companies.  Indeed soon after the
    respondents refused to close the subject transaction, the appellant bought out
    a business partner’s share in a marina business.  While the company itself may be unique in
    what it does, the appellant’s acquisition of the business was not – the
    appellant acquires businesses for a living.  In my view, the trial judge did not err in rejecting the remedy of
    specific performance.  While the court’s
    required supervisory role may have been a limited one, now some near four years
    have passed since this deal was scheduled to close and over four years since
    the deal was negotiated.  On all the
    evidence, an award of damages is the appropriate remedy.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>            5.         Did the learned trial judge err in
    limiting the plaintiff’s damages to three
    months loss of financial benefit?</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    answer to this question must be yes.  I
    accept the appellant’s submission in paragraph 62 of his factum:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The
    sole justification for limiting the plaintiff’s damages to three months lay in
    his supposed mitigation combined with the finding that the plaintiff did not
    place any evidence before the Court that he was in a position to carry out both
    this transaction and the marina transaction.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
    my view, three months is simply not adequate time for a businessman to search
    out and find another opportunity, negotiate a new Agreement of Purchase and
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Sale and close that
    transaction.  If one considers that the
    parties hereto began negotiations early in August and were able to settle on a
    proposed closing date at the end of December – some five months later, in my
    view seven months is reasonable. I would allow an additional two months to
    search out and locate a new investment opportunity. Here, the opportunity, or
    venture, had already been found and negotiations began in earnest
    immediately.  There must in addition be
    some allowance for locating a suitable business investment and doing
    preliminary inquiries before the serious negotiation that will follow once an
    opportunity for investment has been located and selected.  In my view, a reasonable time period to
    complete the foregoing would be seven months, and I would increase the damages
    accordingly.</span></p>

    damages.</span></p>
