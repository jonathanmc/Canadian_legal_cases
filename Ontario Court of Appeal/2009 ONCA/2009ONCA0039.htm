  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US> OVERVIEW</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is an appeal from the trial judge’s order of support and equalization under
    the <i>Family Law Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3.  The appellant wife submits:
    first, that the trial judge’s reasons were insufficient; second, that he
    erred in concluding that she was able to contribute in part to her own support
    and that he committed various other errors relating to spousal support; third,
    that he erred in excluding from the respondent’s net family property money
    held by the respondent husband and his father in a joint account.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    parties were married on February 22, 1988 and separated some 13 years later
    on September 4, 2002.  They had no children.  The appellant was 44 and the
    respondent was 49 at the time of trial in 2007.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the time of marriage in 1988, the appellant was a dental assistant.  She
    later left that job due to injuries from a motor vehicle accident.  In 1994,
    she took up employment as a car salesperson.  In 1998, with the concurrence
    of her husband, she left that job and has not been employed since. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent was an employee of DOFASCO and at the time of trial was earning
    an annual salary of approximately $100,000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent managed his father Peter’s financial affairs pursuant to a power
    of attorney from 1995 until Peter’s death on December 11, 2002.  In June
    and July of 1998, the respondent transferred approximately $500,000 out of
    a joint account with his father and invested the funds aggressively in accounts
    in his own name.  By the date of separation in September of 2002, the money
    had grown to $640,000.  Putting aside any legal arguments as to the effect
    of the funds having run through various accounts, the appellant’s expert,
    Mr. Joslin, agreed with the calculation and tracing of funds by the respondent’s
    expert, Mr. Sgro.  Joslin noted, however, that some of the funds had been
    removed along the way. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent testified that, as a result of a conversation with his father,
    it was his understanding he could use the interest on his father’s money
    as his own but not the principal.  He claimed that the $500,000 principal
    that originally went into the joint account was not “owned” by him within
    the meaning of the opening of s. 4(2) of the <i>Family Law Act</i>.  He<i> </i>claimed
    a total of $635,568.40 on his Net Family Property Statement, describing it
    as “other excluded property by reason of implied trust for the benefit of
    Peter Harrington”.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE TRIAL JUDGE’S DECISION</span></h4>
  <h3><i>1.         Spousal Support</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge rejected the appellant’s evidence that she was unable to work.  He
    found that the appellant’s job of selling cars was still open to her if she
    wanted it. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that while the appellant had
    “referred to Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder... many times in her testimony”,
    that it was not clear on all the expert evidence that “that is her problem.”  He
    accepted that she may have had “something bothering her, like anxiety and/or
    depression” but could not “be clearly placed into the diagnosis of PTSD.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    reaching this conclusion, the trial judge noted that he was not “impressed” by
    the evidence of her medical providers.  The trial judge considered the appellant’s
    evidence and found her to be “histrionic and exaggerating her position.”  He
    disbelieved some specific incidents of alleged spousal abuse by the respondent.  He
    also found that the medical evidence supporting her complaint of PTSD was
    based on her narrative.  When admitted to hospital for observation, the appellant
    had checked herself out before a definitive diagnosis was obtained.  The
    trial judge also noted that if the appellant were truly suffering from PTSD,
    she would not have continued to visit her husband and go to his apartment
    after their separation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that the appellant had suffered no economic disability
    as a result of the marriage.  He attributed part-time income to the appellant
    of about $7,600 a year based on his finding that she was able to contribute
    to her own support through part-time employment.  He applied the needs-based
    approach to support and, in the end, held that the appellant was entitled
    to support of $2,100 per month, as opposed to the $3,000 a month she had
    previously been receiving on an interim basis. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge rejected the appellant’s request for retroactive support in part
    because she called no evidence to support this request and in part because
    she failed to establish a past need prior to the making of the interim support
    order. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    counsel appear to have agreed that a review order was appropriate.  The appellant’s
    lawyer sought a review after four or five years and the respondent’s lawyer
    after three years.  The trial judge ordered that support be reviewed in three
    years time, on May 1, 2010 “with need to show material change in circumstances
    by either party, Shelley Harrington’s efforts to secure employment and a
    review of her mental health issues.”  It appears from the record that the
    trial judge omitted a word such that the review order should have read, “with <b>no</b> need
    to show material change in circumstances” (emphasis added).</p>
  <h3><i>2.         </i><i>Equalization</i><i> of Property</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that the respondent had a power of attorney to manage his
    father’s funds in the joint account.  He described the respondent’s use of
    the funds as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>He moved funds in and out of various accounts for
    various reasons…. He invested the funds which brought good returns. He used
    some of these increases from investment for Peter’s benefit. He also used
    some for the benefit of himself and Shelley.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that the manner in which the respondent handled the funds “did
    not alter their nature”.  In his view, they were the father’s funds and ultimately
    formed part of his estate which was divided between the respondent and his
    sister.  As such, he accepted the respondent’s contention that they did not
    form part of his net family property pursuant to s. 4(2) of the <i>Family
    Law Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge stated that “[t]he amount to be excluded is difficult to determine.  The
    original funds in 1998 were approximately $500,000 but grew to approximately
    $640,000 in 2002.”  He held that the entire amount of $640,000.00 should
    be excluded.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    relation to a yacht, the trial judge found that it was purchased by the respondent
    but was jointly owned.  The trial judge valued it at $56,400 in total ($28,200
    for each spouse) using the valuation date nearest to the date of trial.  He
    accepted an expert valuation of the respondent’s pension. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    setting out the equalization calculation, the trial judge ordered the respondent
    to pay the appellant $28,200 for her share in the yacht and a further $56,379.62.  Because
    the appellant wished to purchase the respondent’s interest in the matrimonial
    home, valued at $152,500, he ordered a set-off against this amount as well
    as a sum previously owing by the appellant of some $11,053.  In the result,
    the appellant was ordered to pay the respondent a total of $78,974.29.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      issues raised by the appellant may be summarized as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.         Were the trial judge’s reasons sufficient?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2.         Did the trial judge err in concluding
    that the appellant was able to contribute in part to her own support or otherwise
    err in ordering support as he did?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3.         Did the trial judge err in his treatment
    of the $500,000 capital from the respondent’s father or the increase on those
    funds by excluding them from the respondent’s net family property?</p>
  <h3><i><span lang=EN-US>1.         Sufficiency of Reasons</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    trial judge’s reasons serve the function of explaining the decision to the
    parties, providing public accountability and permitting effective appellate
    review.&nbsp; The trial judge’s reasons, read in the context of the record
    as a whole, must demonstrate that he or she was alive to and resolved the
    central issues before the court: <i>R. v. R.E.M.</i>, 2008 SCC 51.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    were two live issues at trial.  The first issue was whether the appellant
    was incapable of working outside the home and therefore entitled to full
    spousal support.  The second, which the trial judge characterized as “the
    major dispute” between the parties, was the treatment of the money originating
    from the respondent’s father.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    relation to the first issue, the appellant complains that the trial judge
    did not mention aspects of the evidence that were favourable to her.  However,
    the mere fact that the trial judge did not mention all the evidence adduced
    at trial does not mean that the reasons are inadequate: <i>R.E.M</i>.  Moreover,
    it is clear that the trial judge’s view of the appellant’s credibility and
    his overall acceptance of the respondent’s evidence was a critical factor
    in his conclusion that she would be able to contribute to her own support.  As
    such, he did not refer to aspects of the appellant’s own evidence and specific
    evidence that was dependent on her narrative.  The appellant cannot now ask
    us to substitute our own assessment of credibility for the trial judge’s
    opinion by impugning the reasons for judgment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to the second issue, the appellant complains that the trial judge
    failed to refer to a number of pieces of evidence such as the conclusion
    of a forensic accountant and the fact that the respondent reported income
    from his father’s funds on his tax return.  In my view, although the trial
    judge could have explained his reasons for excluding the entire amount of
    $640,000 from the respondent’s net family property more fully, his reasons
    were nonetheless adequate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge rejected the appellant’s contention that the money became the
    property of the respondent by way of gift from his father.  He also rejected
    her argument that the parties’ use of the funds demonstrated that they were
    a family asset.  Although the trial judge did not refer to all of the evidence
    adduced at trial, again, this in itself is by no means fatal.  Moreover,
    in relation to the evidence regarding the tax treatment of the funds, the
    trial judge did refer to this issue obliquely when he stated “I make no finding
    that a criminal or otherwise improper act transpired.  They are not in issue
    here.”<span style='font-size:12.0pt;color:#3A3A3A'>  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    relation to the father’s capital, I am satisfied that the reasons disclose
    a logical connection between the evidence and the trial judge’s decision
    and demonstrate that he grappled with the substance of the live issues at
    trial.  Any deficiency in the reasons by no means precludes this court from
    conducting meaningful appellate review.  In relation to the increase in the
    father’s capital, I would hold that the reasons do permit appellate review
    although, as I explain below, I would disagree with the conclusion reached
    by the trial judge. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I would reject this ground of appeal. </p>
  <h3><i>2.         Spousal Support</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge failed to consider or appropriately
    weigh the following evidence in concluding that she would be able to contribute
    to her own support:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    evidence of an executive director of a woman’s shelter who treated the appellant
    and concluded that she suffered from domestic abuse;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    opinion of the appellant’s therapist that she would require years of therapy
    before she would be able to return to work;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    evidence of the appellant’s family physician who agreed with the conclusion
    that the appellant suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and thought
    that the appellant was employable in the medium or long-term but not immediately;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>a
    psychiatrist’s opinion that the appellant was depressed, had anxiety disorder
    and could not hold down a job;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>a
    discharge sheet from a 2004 hospital admission stating that the appellant
    had PTSD and was in partial remission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    significance of the above evidence was dependent on the appellant’s narrative.  Again,
    nothing turns on the fact that the trial judge did not refer to the detail
    of this evidence in his reasons.  It certainly does not mean that he misapprehended
    the evidence or failed to consider relevant evidence.  Moreover, the trial
    judge’s conclusion that it was unclear whether the appellant was suffering
    from PTSD was consistent with the evidence of the appellant’s own family
    physician, Dr. James, as well as another doctor, Dr. Murphy.  Having regard
    to the trial judge’s assessment of the appellant’s credibility, I cannot
    say that he erred in attributing to her some ability to support herself. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the appellant’s factum adverted to the failure of the trial judge to consider
    her argument for retroactive support that issue was not pursued before us.  In
    any event, I would not disturb the trial judge’s conclusion in this regard.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    counsel, at trial and on appeal, agreed that a review order was appropriate
    (although there was some disagreement as to when the review should take place).  As
    such, I make no comment on the appropriateness of the trial judge’s review
    order in general.  I would, however, alter the order so as to correct the
    omission of the word “no” so that it reads: “with no need to show a change
    in material circumstances by either party”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Otherwise,
    I would dismiss the appeal with respect to support.</p>
  <h3><i>3.         Equalization of Property</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is a rebuttable presumption that an adult child holds funds in a joint account
    with their parent on resulting trust.  That presumption may be rebutted if
    the evidence establishes that the transferor’s intent was to make an outright
    gift.
     Though each case turns on its own facts and the overall inquiry is the transferor’s
    intent at the time of the transfer, particularly relevant evidence includes:
    the granting of a power of attorney, the wording of bank documents, the control
    and use of the funds in the account, the tax treatment of the joint account
    and evidence subsequent to the transfer if it is relevant to the transferor’s
    intention at the time of transfer: <i>Pecore v. Pecore</i>, [2007] 1 S.C.R.
    795.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  The
    respondent claimed that both the $500,000 capital as well as the $140,000
    increase in the funds should not be included in the calculation of his net
    family property because he held them by way of a resulting trust for his
    father. However, in relation to the increase of $140,000 the respondent’s
    own evidence belies that position.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent testified that in 1998 he invested his father’s capital of $500,000,
    originally held in his father’s account at TD Waterhouse, in various Royal
    Bank mutual funds.  The mutual funds were in the respondent’s name only and
    he contributed and withdrew from them depending on world market conditions.  The
    Royal Bank didn’t like him going “into and out of” the funds so frequently,
    so he went to CIBC and started doing the same thing.  He then moved the money
    from the CIBC account into a joint account at TD Canada in the name of himself
    and his father, used it to transfer drafts in and out, and eventually put
    the money back into his father’s account at TD Waterhouse.  The TD Waterhouse
    account became the estate account which was divided equally between the respondent
    and his sister. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    stated previously, the respondent testified that his understanding was that
    he was not to have access to the principal.  At the beginning of the investment
    arrangement, he did not access the income either.  However, as a consequence
    of a conversation he had with his father, he understood that he could use
    these funds for himself.  The respondent testified that he used some of the
    income for his own purposes and the purposes of his family.
     Examples he gave were the purchasing of vacations for himself and his wife
    and to purchase a boat in 1998 or 1999.  That boat was sold and the yacht
    purchased in 2000.  He also paid some of his credit card bills and some of
    his COSTCO bills using his power of attorney respecting his father’s account.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent also used some of the income on the $500,000 to pay for his father’s
    cost of care after the father moved to a care facility.  At one point, the
    respondent testified that the cost of his father’s care was $4,000 a month.  At
    another point, he testified that it was $5,000.  He acknowledged that the
    last facility his father resided in cost only about $1,800 a month.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent declared all of the income from the money invested in his name
    on his tax returns for 1998, 1999, and 2000.  In 2001, he also declared some
    of the income on his tax return and caused some to be declared by the appellant
    as she was not working and would pay less tax on it. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    timing of the movement of the funds is also instructive.  On September 5,
    2002, the day after the appellant and respondent separated, the respondent
    caused $379,402.97 to be transferred from the joint TD Canada Account #015-0525020
    in the name of his father and himself to his father’s TD Waterhouse account
    #68X186A.  He transferred a further $250,000 on December 19, 2002, eleven
    days after his father died, and a further $9,000 on December 30 to account
    #68X186A.  The total amount transferred was $638,402.17. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that by the date of separation in 2002, the original $500,000
    investment had grown to $640,000.  At a later point in his reasons he observed
    that the exact amounts in the CIBC and TD Waterhouse accounts totalled $635,242.61.  In
    his reasons, however, the trial judge commented that these were assets of
    the estate and then added
    “[t]here is no evidence that the property existed on the valuation date.”  This
    may have been an acknowledgment that on the valuation date, none of the funds
    were in the father’s TD Waterhouse account #68X186A.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge held that the funds did not change character when they left the
    joint account and were transferred into an account in the respondent’s name.  In
    so holding, the trial judge was effectively saying that the presumption of
    resulting trust had not been rebutted.  Despite the late payment of the funds
    to the TD Waterhouse account, I would not disturb the trial judge’s conclusion
    in regard to the $500,000 principal amount.  The respondent testified that
    it was never the father’s intention to allow him to access the principal
    and it was open to the trial judge to accept his evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    same cannot be said of the income stream from the capital. The respondent
    generated all of the increase in the capital from investment accounts in
    his name only.  While ordinarily the income or growth on trust funds would
    also be held in trust for the beneficiary, the respondent’s evidence was
    that he was entitled to use the income for himself.  He declared the income
    as his own on his income tax returns. As noted above, he used the increase
    to make significant purchases for himself and to pay his own bills. The evidence
    does not support the trial judge’s conclusion that the $140,000 was held
    by the respondent in trust for his father and that it never belonged to the
    respondent.  Rather, the $140,000 increase fell within the definition of “property” under
    section 4(1) of the <i>Family Law Act </i>as, “property over which a spouse
    has, alone or in conjunction with another person, a power of appointment
    exercisable in favour of himself or herself.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pursuant
    to s. 4(3), the onus of proving a deduction or exclusion is on the person
    claiming it.  The respondent has not discharged this onus.  Accordingly,
    the $140,000 increase should not be excluded pursuant to s. 4(2) of the <i>Family
    Law Act</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also refers to “unidentified and undisclosed” assets and seeks
    to attribute further sums to the respondent.  However, the uncontradicted
    testimony of the respondent was that he had no other bank accounts, savings,
    securities or other assets at the date of separation or the date of trial
    other than those described in his Net Family Property Statement and his financial
    statement.  While the appellant now complains that the extent of financial
    disclosure was inadequate, this was a matter to be dealt with before or at
    the trial.  I would therefore reject her contention that further amounts
    should be added to the respondent’s net family property.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would dismiss the appeal with respect to support.  However, I would order
    that the portion of paragraph 1 of the trial judge’s order respecting a review
    of spousal support be changed to read “with no need to show material change
    in circumstances by either party” as the omission of the word “no” in the
    trial judge’s order appears to be an error.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    relation to the equalization payment, I would allow the appeal in part and
    order that $140,000 be added to the respondent’s property on his Net Family
    Property Statement and that the equalization payment be recalculated accordingly.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>COSTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the time of hearing this appeal we received counsel’s submissions on the
    costs of this appeal and we have no need of further submissions in that regard.  However,
    the result of our order may affect the award of costs at trial.  Indeed,
    in awarding costs to the respondent, the trial judge stated that, in particular,
    the last offer made by the respondent played a significant part in his fixing
    of costs.  It is therefore necessary to consider what that offer was in order
    to deal with the costs below as well as the parties’
    bills of costs.</p>

    written submissions concerning the costs at trial totalling no more than
    four pages in length within seven days of the release of these reasons for
