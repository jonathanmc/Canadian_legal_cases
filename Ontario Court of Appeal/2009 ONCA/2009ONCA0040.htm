  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE ISSUE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    issue on this appeal is whether an order made pursuant to Rule 49.09 enforcing
    a settlement agreement arrived at prior to the commencement of a proceeding
    is a nullity because the court lacked jurisdiction to make the order.  The
    court dismissed the appeal at the end of argument.  These are our reasons
    for doing so. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was terminated without cause by the respondents in October, 2002.  He
    negotiated, with the assistance of counsel, a severance package with the
    respondents which resulted in a written settlement agreement in May, 2003. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    July, 2003, the appellant issued a statement of claim claiming damages for
    wrongful dismissal and overtime pay alleged to be owing to him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    October, 2003, the respondent brought a motion for summary judgment pursuant
    to rule 49.09 to enforce the settlement between the parties.  The respondent
    submitted that the rule applied to settlements made both before and after
    the commencement of litigation.  The appellant did not oppose the jurisdiction
    of the court on the motion. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    November 3, 2003, Karakatsanis J. held that rule 49.09 was available for
    pre-litigation settlement agreements and granted summary judgment in accordance
    with the terms of the settlement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    May 3, 2004, the appellant brought a motion under rule 59.06 before Karakatsanis
    J. to set aside her order.  He argued that the settlement was void and could
    not dispose of his claim for overtime pay because the defendants had failed
    to comply with federal and provincial labour legislation and had failed to
    negotiate the settlement in good faith.  He did not raise the issue of whether
    Karakatsanis J. had jurisdiction to hear the respondent’s motion under rule
    49.09.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    an endorsement dated May 19, 2004, Karakatsanis J. dismissed the appellant’s
    motion.  She found that, in the interest of finality, settlements entered
    into with the assistance of counsel should be upheld except in the clearest
    of cases.  She found that there was no evidence of fraud, mistaken instructions
    or bad faith leading up to the settlement and the appellant had failed to
    lead evidence to show that the respondent had breached the <i>Canada Labour
    Code</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant appealed both of Karakatsanis J.’s orders to this court.  He moved
    to admit fresh evidence in support of the claim that the settlement was void
    since it did not comply with the <i>Canada Labour Code</i>.  Again, he did
    not raise the jurisdictional issue regarding rule 49.09.  This court dismissed
    the motion to admit fresh evidence, noting that Karakatsanis J. had properly
    found that the evidence was generic and did not address his claim regarding
    overtime pay with any specificity.  The court dismissed the appeal, finding
    that the appellant had failed to demonstrate palpable or overriding error. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant then moved before Allen J., arguing for the first time, that rule
    49.09 did not apply to pre-litigation settlements and that the two orders
    of Karakatsanis J. and the orders of this court were therefore nullities.  Allen
    J. dismissed the appellant’s motion and the appellant now appeals to us. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    issue now raised by the appellant was not raised in any prior proceedings.  As
    we understand the appellant’s argument he contends that the original motions
    judge had no jurisdiction to hear the motion because the alleged settlement
    preceded the litigation and was therefore not a rule 49 settlement.  The
    appellant contends that if the original decision was made without jurisdiction
    all subsequent decisions including the decision of this court are void and
    it is as if none are made.  This argument entirely misconceives the nature
    of jurisdiction and ignores the essential need for finality in litigation.  Jurisdiction
    refers to a court’s authority to hear and determine a matter before the court.  If
    a court has authority to determine a matter before it, the court does not
    lose jurisdiction if it makes the wrong ruling. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    authority of the court to hear a motion to enforce a settlement is beyond
    question. Pursuant to s. 97 of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, “the Court
    of Appeal and the Superior Court of Justice…may make binding declarations
    of right, whether or not any consequential relief is or could be claimed.”  Section
    96 also preserves the common law. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    contract to enforce a settlement was enforceable at common law.  Thus the
    court had jurisdiction to enforce the settlement by making a declaration
    as to whether the settlement was binding on the appellant.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    method chosen to enforce the settlement was a motion pursuant to rule 49.09.  Whether
    the motions judge made the correct decision in enforcing the settlement pursuant
    to rule 49.09 is irrelevant to the question of jurisdiction.  The appellant
    sued in the Superior Court and the respondent brought a motion for judgment
    according to the terms of an agreement.  The motions judge had jurisdiction
    to hear and decide the issue of whether or not the proposed action was in
    fact the subject of a binding settlement precluding further litigation, regardless
    of what rule the motion was brought under. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    original decision of the motions judge was appealable and in fact was appealed
    by the appellant.  The decision was also open to challenge under rule 59.06
    and was challenged under that rule by the appellant.  Both the appeal and
    the rule 59.06 motion failed.  There is no basis either in policy or in any
    provision of the <i>Courts of Justice Act </i>to permit a third attempt to
    challenge the result arrived at on the initial motion years ago.  None of
    the decisions were void or voidable.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    will however comment on the method of enforcement with a view to giving some
    guidance for the future.  We agree with the appellant that rule 49.09 was
    likely not the appropriate method by which to enforce the settlement.  The
    weight of judicial authority is that rule 49.09 only applies to settlements
    arrived at after a proceeding, that is, an action or application, has been
    initiated.  As we have indicated, this does not mean that the court’s decision
    was a nullity for want of jurisdiction. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent’s motion was brought in the context of the action commenced by
    the appellant for damages for wrongful dismissal.  It was in effect a motion
    for summary judgment to dismiss the action on the basis of the settlement.  Rule
    37.02 says that a judge has jurisdiction to hear any motion in a proceeding. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rule
    20 was available to the defendant after delivering a statement of defence.  While
    no statement of defence had been delivered at that time, rule 2 states that
    a failure to comply with the rules is an irregularity that does not render
    an order in a proceeding a nullity and that a court may grant such relief
    as is just to secure the just determination of the real matters in dispute.  The
    court, pursuant to rule 2.01(1), could have dispensed with the requirement
    to observe this step and in the circumstances would undoubtedly have done
    so.  What the appellant is saying ignores the provisions of rule 2. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant relies on s. 146 of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>.  Section
    146 states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Jurisdiction conferred on a court, a judge or a
    justice of the peace, shall in the absence of express provision for procedures
    for its exercise in any Act, regulation or rule, be exercised in a manner
    consistent with the due administration of justice. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    requirements of s. 146 were met. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    would point out that the self-represented appellant’s delay in bringing his
    motion is unexplained, the jurisprudence upon which the appellant relies
    was available at the time of the original litigation, and the justice of
    the case does not lead us to conclude that the result would have been any
    different had the issue been raised in the original proceedings. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> For
    these reasons, the appeal is dismissed, with costs fixed at $5,000, inclusive
    of disbursements and G.S.T. </p>
