    sought to investigate a series of fraudulent mortgage transactions involving
    two lawyers. One of the lawyers was David Molson. The application judge found
    that the Royal Bank’s determination that it had been defrauded was made in
    good faith and was reasonable in the circumstances. </p>

line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Molson
    maintained a mixed trust account at the Toronto Dominion Bank. Without giving
    Molson notice, an investigator at the Royal Bank provided the Toronto Dominion
    Bank with information on the mortgage transactions. The Royal Bank obtained
    information from the Toronto Dominion Bank regarding specific mortgage advances
    made by the Royal Bank into Molson’s mixed trust account. Specifically, the
    Toronto Dominion Bank provided the Royal Bank with copies of cheques which
    it had determined were relevant to the Royal Bank mortgage advances at issue. </p>

    of the suspect transactions, and that he acted for both the bank and the

      APPLICATION JUDGE’S DECISION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge provided extensive reasons for refusing to grant the declaratory
    relief requested by the appellants. He considered the impugned provisions,
    both in terms of their purpose and effect, and he concluded that they did
    not attract s. 8 <i>Charter </i>scrutiny. His reasons in this regard are
    summarized below.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,   the
    application judge found that the impugned provisions are not facially unconstitutional,
    and that they can be interpreted in a manner consistent with the <i>Charter</i> in
    so far as they grant discretion to certain actors. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    he found that the purpose of <i>PIPEDA</i> is to regulate the collection,
    use and disclosure of personal information by private organizations engaged
    in commercial activity. In doing so, <i>PIPEDA</i> does not transform the
    activities of these organizations into governmental activities, nor does
    it transform the organizations themselves into state agents.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    on the facts of this case, the application judge was satisfied that the Royal
    Bank was acting to protect its private interests. He concluded that the Royal
    Bank and the Toronto Dominion Bank, as private actors and as members of the
    BCPIO, were not acting as state agents or in furtherance of an inherently
    governmental function.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the application judge concluded that the impugned provisions did not attract
    s. 8 <i>Charter</i> scrutiny. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Alternatively,
    the application judge found that if s. 8 was implicated, <i>PIPEDA</i> permitted
    the disclosure of records and “[i]n the context of an investigation by a
    private body to protect its private interests, the absence of a requirement
    of prior judicial authorization [was] not ‘unreasonable’ under s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>” (para.
    49). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    other words, in the opinion of the application judge, if s. 8 was engaged,
    the searches and seizures prescribed by the impugned provisions were authorized
    by law and the law itself was reasonable, considering the context of the
    provisions and their purpose in preventing fraudulent or other illegal activity
    that could put the economic interests of private entities at risk.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree with the application judge’s conclusion, particularly as it relates
    to his finding that the impugned provisions do not attract s. 8 <i>Charter</i> scrutiny.
    That is not to say that s. 8 rights could never be triggered in relation
    to these provisions. Manifestly they could be if, for example, it could be
    shown that an organization, such as a bank, was acting not as a private entity
    but as a state agent: see <i>R. v. Buhay</i>, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 631, at para.
    25.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, we would make the following brief observations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    we question whether the appellants have standing to invoke the protections
    afforded by s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    main protagonist, Molson, was at all material times the Royal Bank’s solicitor
    for the mortgage transactions, as well as the solicitor for the mortgagors.
    As such, he was duty bound to disclose to his client the Royal Bank the information
    he now alleges his client obtained in contravention of his s. 8 <i>Charter</i> rights:
    see the Law Society of Upper Canada’s <i>Rules of Professional Conduct</i>,
    rule 2.04(6.1). In the circumstances, he cannot lay claim to a reasonable
    expectation of privacy in the records relating to the receipt and disbursement
    of funds received from his client concerning the suspect mortgage transactions.
    The lack of a reasonable expectation of privacy on his part becomes all the
    more apparent when we consider the privacy agreement he signed with the Toronto
    Dominion Bank, in which he acknowledged that the bank could disclose the
    very information which he now says it should not have disclosed, without
    a court order, in violation of his s. 8 <i>Charter</i> rights </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    same reasoning applies to the other appellants. Based on the evidence, the
    application judge effectively found that the other appellants were straw
    men who acted as&nbsp;Molson’s surrogates. That finding is not challenged.
    It follows that the other appellants can lay no greater claim to a reasonable
    expectation of privacy than&nbsp;Molson who, as we have pointed out, has
    no such claim. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    we believe that the appellants’ s. 8 <i>Charter</i> argument is misconstrued.
    The impugned provisions of the Act do not confer search and seizure powers
    on private entities, much less private entities that have assumed the role
    of state agents or delegates performing a state function.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    its essence, <i>PIPEDA</i> is a privacy statute. It restricts disclosure
    of private information subject to certain exemptions, one such exemption
    being the detection and prevention of fraudulent activity. In such circumstances,
    where reasonable grounds exist to believe that a private entity has been,
    is, or is about to be defrauded, limited information sharing between private
    business organizations and private investigative bodies is permitted for
    the purpose of preserving and protecting the economic interests of the business
    enterprise at risk. From what we can tell, the impugned provisions of <i>PIPEDA</i> do
    little more than codify the existing common law which permitted the sharing
    of such information in similar circumstances: see <i>Canadian Imperial Bank
    of Commerce v. Sayani </i>(1993), 83 B.C.L.R. (2d) 167 (C.A.), at paras.
    18-32.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, as well as those provided by the application judge, we are
    of the view that the application judge was correct in concluding that the
    impugned provisions of <i>PIPEDA</i> do not, on their face, attract s. 8 <i>Charter</i> scrutiny.
    Nor is there any basis for interfering with the application judge’s further
    conclusion that, in sharing the information in question, the banks were not

    appellants seek leave to challenge the costs award made against them by the
    application judge. In essence, they claim that this is a test case involving
    matters of public interest and that, in the circumstances, the Royal Bank
    should bear its own costs.</p>

    disagree. The application judge was fully aware of the “test case/public
    interest” principles upon which the appellants rely. He referred to them
    in his costs award but refused to give effect to them.</p>

    para. 9 of his reasons, the application judge observed that Molson had raised
    the <i>Charter</i> issue to “shield” his involvement and that of his co-appellants “in
    a significant fraudulent scheme … against the respondent [bank].” In the
    circumstances, he concluded that there was no good reason to depart from
    the ordinary rules of costs.</p>

    see no error in his analysis or conclusion. The application was driven by
    Molson’s private interests. Success would potentially have abrogated the <i>Mareva</i> injunction,
    thereby enabling Molson to retrieve the $6 million worth of cash and assets
    that had been frozen. Accordingly, while we would grant leave on the issue
    of costs, we would dismiss the appeal.</p>
