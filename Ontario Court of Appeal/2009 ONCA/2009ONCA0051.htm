  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge rightly acknowledged that mistakes were made and that this was
    not the best and most thorough investigation. That said, she found against
    the appellant on a number of bases. We need only deal with the question of
    reasonable and probable grounds. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant conceded at trial that his claim for malicious prosecution and
    negligent investigation depended on a finding that there were no reasonable
    and probable grounds for the charges. The trial judge made findings of fact
    that are fatal to that element of the appellant’s case. She found that the
    discrepancies as to the description of the truck and the perpetrator’s physical
    description in relation to the November l, 1997 incident were questions for
    a trier of fact and did not undermine a finding that the police had reasonable
    and probable grounds. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    note that the alleged discrepancy in the description of the truck was relatively
    minor; the officer described the truck as a red GM truck whereas the appellant
    owned a red Chevrolet truck. General Motors of course makes Chevrolet trucks.
    As to the description of the perpetrator, again the discrepancy was relatively
    minor given the distance from which the officer was making his observation.
    There was also the coincidence that several months later the appellant is
    engaged in an allegedly illegal transaction involving firearms with the same
    police agent and undercover officer at the appellant’s home.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the appellant claimed to have had an alibi, that alibi was not disclosed
    until some two years after the charge was laid. Had the matter gone to trial,
    it would have been for the trier of fact to determine whether the late disclosed
    alibi raised a reasonable doubt. It did not in these circumstances undermine
    the officer’s reasonable and probable grounds.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    at the point when the charge was laid, the police were entitled to rely upon
    the information from the police agent who knew the appellant and had identified
    him for the officer. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    for the May 4, 1998 transaction, while there were disputes as to what exactly
    occurred, it was a tenable position that the appellant was aware that the
    sale was to the undercover officer who the appellant had acknowledged had
    produced the money to purchase the firearm and who the appellant also knew
    did not have a FAC. In that case there were reasonable and probable grounds
    to find that an offence had been committed. That there were disputes as to
    what exactly occurred is not uncommon in a criminal investigation and the
    trier of fact would not be bound to accept the appellant’s version of events.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the appeal is dismissed with costs fixed at a total of $16,000 inclusive
    of G.S.T. and disbursements: $8,000 to Ms. Blake’s clients and $8,000 to
    Mr.&nbsp;Marshall’s clients.</p>
