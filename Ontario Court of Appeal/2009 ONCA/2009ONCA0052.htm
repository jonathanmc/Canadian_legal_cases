    appellant appeals from his convictions for simple possession of marijuana
    and possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking.  The sole issue
    on appeal is whether the trial judge erred in admitting the drugs into evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    appellant was stopped for “stunt driving” after he nearly sideswiped an unmarked
    OPP vehicle and then drove for eight kilometres along Highway 401 at a speed
    of 170 km per hour.  After stopping the vehicle, Sergeant Dziepak, the driver
    of the unmarked OPP vehicle, radioed for assistance and Constables Upton
    and Dekker arrived momentarily. In the meantime, Sergeant Dziepak saw the
    appellant place a number of music CDs into a small black drawstring bag on
    the back seat of his vehicle.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    the offence for which the appellant had been apprehended – “stunt driving” under
    s. 172(1) of the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.8 “the Act” – a
    decision was made to impound his vehicle under s. 172(5) of the Act.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    the appellant had been placed in Constable Upton’s cruiser, Constable Upton
    and his partner commenced an inventory search of his vehicle before impounding
    it.  In doing so, Constable Dekker observed a black bag on the floor behind
    the passenger seat and he gave it to Constable Upton. Constable Upton opened
    the bag and observed a small black nylon CD case inside it. The case felt
    heavy and based on information he had received from the dispatcher, Constable
    Upton was concerned that it might contain a gun.  As it turned out, it did
    not. Rather, it contained an ounce of crack cocaine. Elsewhere, in the black
    bag, he found nearly two ounces of marijuana, three cell phones, a blackberry
    and a digital weigh scale. Accordingly, in addition to being charged with “stunt
    driving”, the appellant was also charged with possession of cocaine and possession
    of marijuana for the purpose of trafficking.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sole issue before us is whether the police were entitled, under s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>,
    to search the black bag and CD case and if not, whether the fruits of their
    search should be excluded from evidence under s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge provided brief reasons in which he concluded that the police
    did not breach the appellant’s s. 8 rights; but even if they did, the evidence
    obtained was real, the breach was technical, and the officers were acting
    in good faith. Hence, the evidence would, in any event, have been admissible
    under s. 24(2).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    concluding that the police did not breach the appellant’s s. 8 <i>Charter </i>rights,
    among other reasons, the trial judge held that the police were entitled under
    s. 172 of the Act to do an inventory search of the car.  In this regard,
    he quoted the following passage from this court’s decision in <i>R. v. Nicolosi </i>(1998),
    127 C.C.C. (3d) 176, where at paras. 29 and 30 Doherty J.A. for the court
    stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[29]     Custody
    is defined in the Shorter Oxford Dictionary as “safekeeping, protection,
    charge, care, guardianship”.  Taking a vehicle into “the custody of the law” entails
    more than simply assuming possession and control of the vehicle.  It involves
    the preservation and safekeeping of the vehicle while in the care and control
    of the police.  Nor do I draw any distinction between the vehicle and its
    contents when the vehicle is impounded. Both are equally in the “custody
    of the law”.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[30]     With
    the responsibility to keep the impounded property safe, must come the ability
    to take reasonable steps to achieve that end.  Entering the vehicle for the
    purpose of itemizing visible property of apparent value is entirely in keeping
    with the responsibility to safeguard the vehicle and its contents while they
    are in the custody of the law. Given Constable Bishop’s purpose in entering
    the vehicle, his conduct falls squarely within his authority to take the
    vehicle into the custody of the law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge then found that the black bag was plainly visible in the search
    of the interior of the car and he concluded that the police were conducting
    an inventory search under lawful authority.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant takes issue with the trial judge’<span
lang=EN-US>s factual and legal analysis of the entitlement of the police to do
    an inventory search.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Factually,
      he submits that the trial judge should have rejected the evidence of Constables
      Upton and Dekker – that they were doing an inventory search – and found
      instead that they were really searching for a gun.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>We
      would not give effect to that submission.  The trial judge made no finding
      that the search was a sham or conducted for an improper or ulterior purpose.
      Indeed, as his reasons disclose, he found that the police were in fact
      conducting an inventory search. As the Crown points out, the fact that
      they may also have been looking for a gun did not render the search unlawful:
      see <i>R. v. Caprara</i> (2006), 211 O.A.C. 211 at para. 8.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Legally,
      the appellant contends that on the authority of <i>Nicolosi</i>, the police
      were required to limit their inventory search to “itemizing visible property
      of apparent value”.  On the facts of this case, the appellant submits that
      the police went beyond that.  In particular, he argues that:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The opening
    of the appellant’s bag cannot be justified as part of an inventory search;
    the police would have no cause to do more than note the bag’s presence if
    their search was solely to itemize the car’s visible contents.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect, we disagree with the appellant’s narrow reading of the words “visible
    property”.  As Doherty J.A. pointed out at para. [36] in <i>Nicolosi</i>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>By documenting
    the contents of the vehicle that had any apparent value, the police serve
    the interests of any person who has an interest in the property and who looks
    to the police to safeguard that property while it is in police custody.  It
    is quite wrong to suggest that the only interest is the police interest in
    avoiding civil liability.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    underlying rationale for inventory searches, as explained in <i>Nicolosi</i>,
    belies the appellant’s submission that the police may only itemize objects
    found in a car, but not their contents.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    the underlying rationale of inventory searches, to proceed in that fashion
    would render these searches virtually meaningless.  Thus, if the police found
    a purse and could not look inside it, they would have no way of knowing whether
    it contained pennies or thousands of dollars and if the latter, what steps
    should be taken to safeguard the large sum of money. That, in our view, would
    defeat the purpose of the exercise. In short, if inventory searches are to
    be meaningful and serve the purpose for which they are intended, the police
    cannot be hobbled as the appellant would suggest. They must be able to search
    and itemize the contents of objects such as purses, wallets and bags like
    the one observed in this case, to determine their contents. Of course, any
    inventory search must be executed in a reasonable manner and as is the case
    with other warrantless searches, reasonableness of police conduct will be
    judged against the totality of the circumstances revealed in each case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    follows that the search of the black bag and its contents, as well as the
    search of the CD case and its contents was entirely reasonable and justified.  Indeed,
    the police would have been derelict in their duties had they not carried
    out the searches.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    we affirm the trial judge’s conclusion that the search of the black bag and
    the CD case was lawful and that it did not constitute a breach of the appellant’s
    s. 8 <i>Charter </i>rights.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    view of that conclusion, while it is technically unnecessary to address s.
    24(2), for the sake of completeness, we would simply add that we see no error
    in the trial judge’s analysis or conclusion.  Hence, even if there was a
    s. 8 breach here, the evidence was properly admitted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, the appeal from conviction is dismissed.</p>
