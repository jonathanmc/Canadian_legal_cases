    August 26, 1994, at about 9:15 p.m., the respondent Jason Zsoldos was driving
    home on his motorcycle when he collided with a Canadian Pacific freight train.  While
    the respondent has no memory of the collision, it is apparent that he did
    not see or hear the cars of the train until it was too late to avoid a collision.  He
    slid under the train and as a result lost both arms and a leg.  At the trial
    before Rady J., the only issue was liability.  The trial judge found the
    appellants CP and Gordon Gosnell, the engineer, 75 percent negligent and
    assessed the respondent’s contributory negligence at 25 percent.</p>

    appellants’ principal ground of appeal is that the trial judge erred in finding
    that CP fell below the standard of care without identifying what that standard
    of care required it to do.  The appellants also argue that this error infected
    the trial judge’s finding on causation.  Finally, the appellants submit that
    the trial judge erred in only finding the respondent 25 percent contributorily
    negligent.</p>

    .  The crossing is equipped with two cross bucks that bear reflectorized
    tape on the front only.  The cross buck on the south side, the direction
    from which the respondent was approaching, is 15 feet south of the south
    rail.  There is also an advance warning sign 290 feet before the crossing.  This
    sign, erected by the municipality, alerts motorists to the presence of the
    railway crossing and advises motorists to reduce their speed to 20 kilometres
    per hour as they approach the crossing.  This is a passive system.  There
    are no active warning systems such as lights, bells or gates to warn a motorist
    that a train is in the crossing.  There is no artificial illumination of
    the crossing by street lights.</p>

    the time of the collision, CP ran six to ten trains daily on this line with
    four or five running at night.  They did not move on a fixed schedule.  The
    train with which the respondent collided consisted of three engines and 58
    freight cars.  Most of the cars were of
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      United States</st1:country-region>
    origin and did not have reflectorized markings on them.  The train was over
    a kilometre long and the respondent collided with the 35th car.  Thus, the
    lead engine with its headlights and whistle had long passed the crossing
    at the time of the collision.  The train had recently left a siding and was
    therefore only coming up to speed as it reached the crossing.  The 35th car
    was travelling at about 20 – 25 miles per hour at the time.  </p>

    respondent had been drinking beer with some friends before he set off home
    at approximately
    <st1:time Minute="10" Hour="21" w:st="on">
    9:10 p.m.  The trial judge found that the respondent had a blood alcohol
    level just below the legal limit of 80 milligrams of alcohol in 100 millilitres
    of blood at the time of the collision.  The respondent was travelling at
    the 80 km/hr speed limit and did not reduce his speed as he approached the
    crossing.  The night was clear and warm.  The sun had set by the time the
    respondent left on his motorcycle.  The moon was not yet up.  The headlight
    on the motorcycle was on, and the respondent was probably using the high
    beams.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    indicated, the Bothwell crossing is a typical rural crossing in the sense
    that there is no active warning system such as bells, flashing lights or
    gates.  It is unusual, however, in at least one respect:  the road approaches
    the tracks at an acute angle of 45 degrees, rather than head on at a 90 degree
    angle.  That is not to say that there are not many other rural crossings
    with this problem, but it was a particular problem at this crossing.  It
    was for that reason that the warning sign was erected advising, but not requiring,
    motorists to reduce speed to 20 kilometres per hour.  Another problem at
    this particular crossing at the time of year when this accident occurred
    is, as indicated above, the presence of crops, particularly corn crops that
    can obscure the sight lines.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent introduced important evidence through Curtis Scherer, an expert
    in accident reconstruction, as to when a person driving a motorcycle would
    be able to see a freight train travelling through the Bothwell crossing at
    night.  The respondent also relied upon the evidence of Professor Alison
    Smiley, an expert in ergonomics, the study of human factors to reduce errors
    and accidents.  The consensus of Mr. Scherer and Professor Smiley seemed
    to be that a motorcyclist would not have been able to see the train until
    he was within 80 metres of the crossing even if the person was expecting
    to see a train.  The distance would increase when other variables were taken
    into account, especially that most motorists would not be expecting to find
    a train in the crossing.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent also adduced evidence as to what speed the motorist would have
    to be travelling in order to avoid the collision, given the time necessary
    to react (perception reaction time or PRT) and the time needed to bring the
    motorcycle to a stop.  The respondent’s witnesses developed a number of scenarios,
    using PRTs of 1.5 seconds and 2.5 seconds.  A PRT of 1.5 is based on a relatively
    young person driving in the day.  Consumption of alcohol would increase the
    PRT.  A PRT of 2.5 is a conservative figure used by highway designers.  In
    short, using a PRT of 1.5, the cyclist would have to be travelling at between
    60 and 66 kilometres per hour or less to avoid an accident.  Using a PRT
    of 2.5, which is the standard used by highway designers, the person would
    have to be travelling at 57.9 kilometres per hour or less to be able to stop
    in time.  The trial judge found that the respondent’s PRT was 2.5 seconds
    given his consumption of alcohol.</p>

    conceded that it owed the respondent a duty of care.  The principal issue

    reported accidents at this crossing.  A term of art in the industry is the
    cross-product, being the number of vehicles travelling over the crossing
    daily multiplied by the number of trains.  The cross-product at the Bothwell
    crossing was 300 in 1994.  The trial judge found that there was no regulation
    or government order that governed when an active warning system had to be
    installed.  That decision was left to the discretion of the railway companies
    and the municipalities with input from Transport

  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE
      TRIAL JUDGE’S REASONS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    a review of the evidence, the trial judge turned to the law.  She began with
    the leading case on railway negligence, <i>Ryan v.
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Victoria (City)</i>, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 201.  She correctly set out the law
    as established in <i>Ryan</i>, to which I will make further reference.  She
    found that the applicable government regulations did not mandate any level
    of warning beyond the passive system in place at the Bothwell crossing.  She
    concluded, however, that given the amount of discretion CP had in determining
    what safety measures should be established at level crossings, mere compliance
    with the regulatory framework did not necessarily relieve CP of liability.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge also appears to have concluded that industry practice at the
    time would not have required anything more than the passive system.  While
    Transport
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    had circulated draft guidelines the year before this accident that might
    have required enhanced measures, the trial judge appears to have accepted
    that those guidelines did not reflect industry practice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge reviewed at length the expert evidence adduced by the respondent
    centring around the conditions that the respondent would have faced on the
    night of August 26, 1994.  She also considered the expert evidence concerning
    braking distances, reaction times, perception and driver behaviour.  As I
    read her reasons, the trial judge accepted the expert evidence that the respondent
    would have had a low expectation of a train being in the crossing and that
    the speed advisory sign would have had little or no impact on a driver’s
    choice of speed.  Most significantly, the trial judge appears to have accepted
    as a fact that “a driver with average perception abilities, traveling faster
    than 50 kilometres per hour and using low beams could not have stopped in
    time to avoid a train”. Further, “The same result occurred if high beams
    were used with the motorist travelling at slightly in excess of 60 kilometres
    per hour.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the trial judge concluded that “the crossing as it was configured the night
    of the accident, with only the passive warning and speed advisory alert presented
    an objective risk of harm to users of the highway”.  While she could have
    been clearer, it seems that the trial judge also accepted that the risk was
    reasonably foreseeable given the number of fatalities and injuries at passive
    crossings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge then reviewed the steps taken by CP to deal with this risk.  She
    noted that the Transport Canada inspector had only inspected the crossing
    during the day, although he claimed that he inspected the crossing from the
    perspective of night-time motorists.  She also noted that a CP employee admitted
    that the lack of any lighting was a risk factor for night-time accidents
    and that there was no record of CP ever having reviewed the crossing to ensure
    that a motorist could safely determine if a train is in the crossing.  She
    also noted that the appellants’ witnesses accepted that the cross buck does
    not warn a motorist that a train is in or about to enter the crossing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge also considered what technology was available in 1994 to enhance
    the safety at night at the Bothwell crossing.  She found that a variety of
    technology existed, an issue to which I will return below, since this finding
    lies at the heart of the appellants’ appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the trial judge accepted the evidence from the appellants’ witnesses that “cost
    is no object in eliminating or reducing danger at a crossing”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge then made her findings of fact, most of which are reflected in
    the statement of facts set out above.  The critical findings are that the
    respondent had no expectation that a train would be in the crossing and there
    were no visual clues that a train was in the crossing, given the darkness
    of the night, the lack of lighting in the area, and that the train cars themselves
    were dark.  As well, the crops in the field, especially the corn crop, obscured
    the train’s presence to motorists.  The respondent could not hear the train
    because he was wearing his motorcycle helmet and was driving on a gravel
    road.  The trial judge also found that the respondent’s perception reaction
    time was 2.5 seconds.  Younger persons tend to have a lower PRT, but consumption
    of alcohol increases PRT.  The trial judge then made this critical finding
    of fact:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Given my findings
    of the speed at which Mr. Zsoldos was traveling and his PRT, it is apparent
    that he could not have stopped before the crossing, even had he begun to
    reduce his speed at the advance warning sign.</p>

    trial judge then found that CP was negligent in failing to carry out any
    inspections of the Bothwell crossing at night and in making no attempt to
    determine whether the passive system was sufficient to protect motorists
    using the crossing at night.  She concluded that “it is almost impossible
    to accurately assess the safety of a crossing at night when such an inspection
    is carried out in the bright light of day”.  She further found that had CP
    conducted the inspections that it should have, it would have concluded that
    additional warnings were required, “given the steep angle at which the track
    bisected the roadway, the absence of any ambient lighting and the presence
    of crops on the side of the roadway, all of which conspired to make the presence
    of a train in the crossing very difficult to discern”.  As well, the advance
    warning sign erected by the municipality was situated too close to the track
    to allow a motorist sufficient time to react and slow in time to stop and
    it was advisory only.  CP would know that such signs are frequently ignored
    by motorists.  She concluded her finding of negligence with the following
    summary:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In summary,
    therefore, if CP had undertaken an inspection of this crossing at night,
    it would have concluded that some additional protection was necessary, the
    technology for which clearly existed and the cost of which would not be an
    impediment, according to Mr. Churcher and Mr. Lukianow [the appellants’
    witnesses]. With additional protection, Mr. Zsoldos would have received sufficient
    warning of the presence of the train in the crossing, thereby allowing him
    to avoid the collision.</p>

    trial judge turned to the question of contributory negligence and accepted
    the respondent’s expert’s evidence as to the respondent’s blood alcohol level

    to but below the legal limit of 80 mg/dl.  Thus, there was “no question… that
    his ability to operate the motorcycle was compromised to some extent”.  She
    concluded, however, that the accident would have occurred even if the respondent
    were not impaired.  However, his impairment and the fact that he was driving
    too quickly given the very dark conditions both contributed to the accident.  Using

    Supreme Court of Canada abandoned the special rule that placed railway companies
    in a privileged position within the law of negligence.  The special rule
    was that so long as railway companies complied with government regulations
    and orders, absent extraordinary circumstances, they were under no further
    obligation to act in an objectively reasonable manner.  Henceforth, railway
    companies were subject to the same standard of care as other similarly situated
    defendants.  That does not mean that the regulatory framework is irrelevant.  As
    Major J. explained at para. 40, “Where a statute authorizes certain activities
    and strictly defines the manner of performance and the precautions to be
    taken, it is more likely to be found that compliance with the statute constitutes
    reasonable care and that no additional measures are required.”  He also held,
    however, that where the regulatory framework is general or permits discretion
    as to the manner of performance, mere compliance with the statutory framework “is
    unlikely to exhaust the standard of care”.</p>

    of pre-1994 deregulation amendments to the statutory framework were to shift
    responsibility to the railway companies.  I agree with the trial judge that
    CP’s compliance with the statutory framework did not exhaust the standard

    finding that industry standards did not require anything more than passive
    measures for a rural crossing like the Bothwell crossing, one of 16,000 similar
    crossings throughout the country.  In my view, the evidence of industry standards
    and its application to this case must be approached with caution.  While
    there was some evidence of studies and reports from Transport

    , industry standard on this record was little more than an assertion by CP,
    supported by the Transport Canada witnesses, that given the cross-product
    and the conditions at rural crossings, passive measures were an adequate
    response to the risk.  As counsel for the respondent put it, CP virtually
    was the industry.</p>

    assertion that the defendant met the industry standard.  In that case, at

    to the conclusion that failure to carry out night-time inspections was fraught

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span

      Mr. Stephens' [the Transport Canada inspector] evidence that he attempted
      to inspect a crossing from the perspective of a nighttime motorist. While
      I do not doubt his sincerity on this issue, it seems to me that it is almost

    not have been the operative act of negligence unless it was “also proven
    that the inspection would have resulted in a change to the proximate loss-causing
    act or omission”.  As the appellants correctly point out, the trial judge
    had to ask the additional question of whether the measures already in place
    were reasonable in all the circumstances of the case.  However, factors such
    as night-time inspection and additional measures are not water-tight compartments.  The
    trial judge’s finding was that had CP met the standard of care and carried
    out the necessary inspection of the Bothwell crossing it would have realized
    that additional measures were required.  To apply Professor Fleming’s observation,
    had CP done what it should have, it would have realized, and any reasonable
    railway operator would have realized, that the crossing was fraught with
    obvious risks at night.  In my view, that is the import of the trial judge’s

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Conduct is negligent
    if it creates an objectively unreasonable risk of harm. To avoid liability,
    a person must exercise the standard of care that would be expected of an

    of a known or foreseeable harm, the gravity of that harm, and the burden
    or cost which would be incurred to prevent the injury. In addition, one may

    submit that she erred in law in failing to consider whether the measures
    already in place were reasonable in all the circumstances and in failing
    to identify what additional protection was reasonably feasible in the circumstances.  They
    submit that the trial judge’s conclusory statement to the effect that “some
    additional protection was necessary” is not sufficient.  The appellants submit
    that each of the proposed measures had to be evaluated from the point of
    view of its technological feasibility, cost and efficacy.  Otherwise, the
    trial judge was fixing CP with a standard of perfection; of doing whatever
    was necessary to avoid the accident, which would in effect make CP an insurer.  See <i>Kauffman

    seems to me that the evidence concerning the cross-product is central to
    CP’s submission.  In effect, it asks the court to endorse its economic analysis
    of negligence.  It has, through the vehicle of the cross-product, weighed
    the three factors identified by Major J. in <i>Ryan</i> of the likelihood
    of a known or foreseeable harm, the gravity of that harm, and the burden
    or cost which would be incurred to prevent the injury.  It has decided that
    absent exceptional circumstances, with certain low cross-products, as at
    the Bothwell rural crossing, the risk of harm was a reasonable one to take.  However,
    the trial judge was not bound by CP’s economic analysis.  The trial judge
    was obliged to consider this particular crossing and decide whether because
    of the conditions at this particular crossing it was unreasonable for CP
    to only use a passive warning system at this un-illuminated crossing.  She
    was also entitled to take into account other evidence adduced by the respondents,
    especially the uncontradicted evidence from Professor Smiley, as to the efficacy
    of speed advisory signs.</p>

    somewhat conclusory.  Nonetheless the trial judge did address the first two <i>Ryan</i> factors
    concerning the likelihood of harm and the gravity of that harm.  She noted

    105 and 120 of her reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I do not propose
    to summarize all of the evidence on the issue because it is clear that a
    variety of technology existed to provide warning that a train was occupying
    the intersection, including flashing lights, bells and gates, street lighting
    and reflectorization of train cars and the back of cross bucks. It must be
    noted, however, that some of this technology was in its infancy in 1994.
    For example, CP has recently begun to reflectorize the backs of cross bucks.
    This creates a strobe effect when an approaching car's headlights catch the
    reflector as the train passes through the crossing. It does not appear to
    have been in use in 1994, however.</p>

    to deal with each proposed measure individually, and consider the feasibility,
    including cost, of each measure.  I do not agree.  In my view, it was sufficient
    that the trial judge found that measures were available in 1994 that a reasonable
    railway operator could have employed to meet the standard of care.  It was
    not for the trial judge to dictate which of the proposed measures CP should
    adopt.  It seems to me that for the appellants to succeed on this aspect
    of the case, they must show that the trial judge’s finding was unreasonable;
    that no jury properly instructed could find that any of the measures were
    reasonable in the circumstances.  </p>

    my view, there was evidence from which the trial judge could find that at
    least some of the measures identified in para. 105 of her reasons were known
    to the industry in 1994, and could have been adopted by a reasonable and
    prudent operator in the circumstances.  The central problem identified by
    the trial judge, which is fully supported by the evidence, is that at night
    it was impossible for a motorist to know that a freight train was in the
    crossing until it was too late to stop.  The evidence accepted by the trial
    judge was that the measures taken by CP, at this crossing, were not sufficient.  There
    would be a major benefit if freight cars bore reflective tape, but many freight
    cars come from the United States where there is no requirement for reflectorization.  The
    cross bucks, with reflecting tape or paint only on the front, warned of the
    presence of a railway crossing, but did not warn that there was a train in
    the crossing.  The advisory sign erected by the municipality was similarly
    insufficient.  The expert evidence adduced by the respondents and accepted
    by the trial judge was that an experienced railway operator would know that
    motorists, especially those familiar with the crossing, do not reduce their
    speed in response to such advisory signage.  The trial judge also found that
    the sign was placed too close to the tracks to allow the motorist sufficient
    time to react and slow in order to stop before the crossing.  </p>

    evidence was not helpful in identifying reasonable measures because of the
    different circumstances at those crossings.  However, at least two passive
    measures, illumination of the crossing by a street light and reflectorization

    recognize the problem because they were negligent in failing to carry out
    any night time inspections of the Bothwell crossing.  A trier of fact could
    draw the conclusion that failure to illuminate the crossing in some fashion
    fell below a reasonable standard of care even without expert evidence since “the

    appellants also submit that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence with
    respect to the cost of remedial measures.  The trial judge said the following
    at paras. 106 and 120:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Both Mr. Churcher
    and Mr. Lukianow testified that cost is no object in eliminating or reducing

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In summary,
    therefore, if CP had undertaken an inspection of this crossing at night,
    it would have concluded that some additional protection was necessary, the

    Mr. Lukianow, a manager with CP, testified as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Q.        Now
    would you agree with me that if a danger is recognized at an intersection
    that the costs to protect the public and railway employees from that danger
    really should not be a factor?</p>

    testified as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Q.        All
    right, would you – would it be fair to say that the tension point in developing
    these regulations is whether or not the risk at a particular crossing warrants

    appellants submit that the trial judge failed to properly address the issue
    of causation.  This submission is tied to the submission concerning the standard
    of care and can therefore be briefly dealt with.  CP submits that because
    the trial judge never identified the standard of care she could not find
    that if it met the standard of care the accident would have been avoided.  The
    trial judge addressed causation at para. 120 of her reasons as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>With additional
    protection, Mr. Zsoldos would have received sufficient warning of the presence

    was circumstantial evidence to support this finding.  The respondent adduced
    evidence from Professor Smiley and Mr. Scherer concerning reaction times,
    braking distances and stopping distances, where the motorist was entirely
    reliant upon the vehicle’s headlights.  In particular, Professor Smiley’s
    evidence, summarized by the trial judge at paras. 74 and 75, supported her
    conclusion.  The trial judge said this:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>She testified
    that in this case because of the rural setting, <i>in the absence of any
    natural or artificial lighting</i>, the steep angle of the crossing and the
    presence of foliage obscuring the train's silhouette, a motorist would be
    very reliant on his headlights to see the train in the crossing. Her opinion
    was largely, but not exclusively, predicated on an assumption that Mr. Zsoldos
    was using his low beams.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>She noted that
    the train engine's headlights would have travelled through the crossing well
    before they might otherwise have assisted Mr. Zsoldos to discern the train's
    presence in the crossing. There was approximately 2200 feet in distance between
    the engine and the 35th car. [Emphasis added.]</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Q.        Is
    there any consideration or have – has your group given any thought to placing
    light standards or just standard lights in the intersection?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>A.        Ah,
    that I think – another issue there is cost and that’s not something that

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Q.        Okay,

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>A.        Yeah,

    helpful.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Q.        Okay
    and just so we can make sure we understand the point why would that be helpful?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>A.        <i>Ah,
      simply because the – there would be an additional source of illumination
      right at the crossing itself, illuminating the train and you wouldn’t be
      relying on getting close enough with your headlights that the headlights
      would cast light on the train.  You would be able to see that train before

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Mr. Zsoldos'
    level of impairment was one factor that contributed to the accident that
    occurred, but it was not the only one. The accident would have occurred whether
    Mr. Zsoldos was impaired or not, given CP's failure to take reasonable care
    to protect motorists approaching this crossing. I have also concluded that
    Mr. Zsoldos was driving too quickly in the circumstances, given the very
    dark conditions of that evening.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In assessing
    the level of Mr. Zsoldos' contribution, I consider him to be 25% responsible.

    negligence can arise in three ways.  First, the plaintiff’s negligence may
    have been a cause of the accident in the sense that his acts or omissions
    contributed to the sequence of events leading to the accident.  Second, although
    the plaintiff’s negligence is not a cause of the accident, the plaintiff
    has put himself in a position of foreseeable harm.  Third, as in seatbelt
    cases, the plaintiff may fail to take precautionary measures in the face
    of foreseeable danger.  See P.H. Osborne, <i>The Law of Torts</i>, 3rd ed.

    agree with the appellants that the trial judge erred in fixing the amount
    of contributory negligence on the basis of an analogy to the seat belt cases
    such as <i><span
lang=EN-US>Snushall v. Fulsang</span></i><span lang=EN-US> (2005), 78 O.R. (3d)

      any effect on the verdict.  </span>A plaintiff will be found contributorily
      negligent only where his or her negligence caused the accident or contributed
      to the severity of his injury.  It is not necessary that the plaintiff’s
      negligence be the only cause, but it must have been a proximate or effective
      cause.  Thus, if the plaintiff was negligent but that negligence did not
      in fact cause or contribute to the causation of the accident or damage
      to the plaintiff it is not contributorily negligent.  The burden was on
      the appellants to prove the necessary causation.  See G.H.L. Fridman, <i>The
      Law of Torts in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City

    Toronto: Carswell, 2002), at p. 473.  The basic test for determining causation
    is the “but for” test:  <i><span lang=EN-US>Resurfice Corp. v. Hanke</span></i><span lang=EN-US>,
    [2007] 1 S.C.R. 333, at para. 21.  There is no suggestion that the “but for”

      appellants focused their attention primarily on the evidence of impairment.  They
      submit that “driving while intoxicated is itself a proximate cause of the
      collision”
    and unlike failure to wear a seatbelt does not merely aggravate the injuries.  They
    submit that the conventional cap of 25 percent in seatbelt cases therefore
    has no application to this case.  The appellants have assembled a number
    of cases suggesting that percentages in excess of 50 percent have been applied
    where the plaintiff was intoxicated.</span></p>

      difficulty with applying those cases in this case is the trial judge’s
      finding that the accident would have occurred whether or not the respondent
      was impaired.  This suggests that the appellant’s impairment, which was
      below .08, was not a cause of the accident.  This is consistent with the
      expert evidence of Professor Smiley and Mr. Scherer that even using a PRT
      of 1.5 seconds, if the respondent was travelling in excess of 66 kilometres
      per hour, the collision could not have been avoided.</span></p>

      excessive speed or as it was put by the trial judge, that the respondent “</span>was

      of that evening”.  In those circumstances, the 25 percent assessment of
      responsibility to the respondent may have been somewhat excessive, but
      there was no cross-appeal by the respondent. It follows that I would not
