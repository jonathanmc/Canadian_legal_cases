      relationship. Neither her mother nor the appellant seemed at all concerned

      to further petition her mother with greater success. The appellant did
      point out that he paid for a satellite dish for T.F. and her husband (having

      T.F.s belief that the appellant had improperly obtained funds from the
      M estate to purchase a new home, and had otherwise converted various estate
      assets into cash for his own personal benefit. The M estate was the estate

      looting of the assets of the estate and their conversion into cash for
      the appellants benefit. T.F. denied ever having discussed the M estate

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='

      appellant does <i>not</i> challenge the trial judges favourable finding
      about K.F.s credibility, nor his use of demeanour as a factor in the credibility
      determination. The nub of the appellants complaint is that the credibility
      finding was based exclusively on demeanour with the result that the finding
      of guilt followed directly from the favourable credibility determination
      without any critical assessment of the reliability of the complainants
      deeply-flawed evidence.</span></p>

      cross-examination was her failure to recall and uncertainty about several
      critical features of her testimony, such as the frequency of the appellants
      improprieties and when they had occurred. The complainant could not recall
      what her Nana had asked her immediately before K.F.s disclosure, or even
      the drink the appellant had given her before he told her to sit on his

      respondent sees it differently. The trial judge considered both the credibility
      and reliability of K.F. Some factors he mentioned in assessing the testimony
      of K.F. had to do with demeanour, but many were related to reliability.
      The trial judge did not proceed directly from a demeanour-based finding
      of credibility to a finding of guilt, rather considered reliability, found
      K.F. to be reliable and her evidence, confirmed in several respects, sufficiently
      persuasive to establish guilt. </span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The correct disposition of this
      case is dependant upon an assessment of credibility. An assessment of credibility
      involves evaluation not only of the honesty of the particular witness,

      rely on the testimony of a dishonest witness in the absence of some independent
      corroborative evidence; however, even honest witnesses can be mistaken.
      It sometimes happens that a witness will be quite honest and sincere yet
      his or her evidence may not be reliable due to external factors such as
      ability to observe, remember, or relate accurately. In the case at bar,
      the credibility and therefore both the honesty and the reliability of the

      appellant contends that the trial judge improperly rejected the appellants
      denial of any inappropriate conduct. The rejection, the submission continues,
      is flawed because it is rooted in misapprehensions of material parts of
      the appellants evidence. The trial judge mischaracterized the appellants
      description of the nature of his relationship with T.F.  Further, the trial
      judge lifted part of the appellants response about kissing T.F. out of
      its context, colouring it in a hue that was foreign to its origins.</span></p>

      evidence is not flawed by any misapprehension of his testimony. The trial
      judge was entitled to reject the appellants version on the basis of any
      answers provided by the appellant in cross-examination and reasonable inferences
      arising from those responses. The basis for the rejection of the appellants
      rendition is well-grounded in the evidence and untainted by any misapprehensions. </span></p>

      trial judge gave several reasons for rejecting the testimony of the appellant.
      Among those reasons was the rosy-coloured hue the appellant placed on his
      relationship with T.F. The appellant considered that he had a good relationship
      with his step-daughter, T.F., yet she described him as emotionally abusive
      and left home to escape his domineering personality. The M estate was a
      further sore point. Besides, the appellant was clearly annoyed at T.F.

      his disability income for a $3,000 satellite dish.</span></p>

      deny kissing his step-daughter because fathers often kiss their children
      in a normal relationship and in a non-sexual way as a simple manifestation
      of parental affection.  The question that prompted the answer appears
      to have been directed principally at the incident that founded the subject-matter
      of the count of indecent assault against T.F. but, apart from its temporal
      reference, the question could be interpreted more broadly. So too, the

      1 S.C.R. 788 at para. 23;  <i>M.(R.E.)</i> at para. 50. For reasons he
      articulated, the trial judge rejected the appellants denial. The trial
      judge did not believe the denial nor did it raise a reasonable doubt about
      the appellants guilt. This rejection was not flawed by any material misapprehension

    that he had never been alone with his granddaughter and had not taken improper
    advantage of the proceeds of the M estate. He also found wanting the appellants

      during adulthood, on the other. While the standard of proof to be met in
      a criminal case is a constant, not a variable dependent upon the age or
