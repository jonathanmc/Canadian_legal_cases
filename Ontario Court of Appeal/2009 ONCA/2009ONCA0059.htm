    appeal from two decisions of Durno J. concerns the interpretation and constitutionality
    of s. 517 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46.  That section
    requires the judge or justice of the peace presiding at a bail hearing to
    impose a ban on publication of the proceedings where the prosecutor intends
    to show cause why the accused should not be released on an undertaking without
    conditions and the accused requests the publication ban.  In 1984, just two
    years after the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms </i>came into
    force, this court upheld the constitutionality of the mandatory publication
    ban in <i>Re Global Communications Ltd. and Attorney General for Canada</i> (1984),
    44 O.R. (2d) 609.  The application judge followed <i>Global</i> and upheld
    the constitutionality of the provision.  He also resolved an issue of interpretation
    of s. 517 holding that where one of several jointly charged accused requests
    the publication ban, the ban applies to the show cause hearings of all of
    the accused. </p>

    early June 2006, the police arrested twelve adults and five young persons
    for terrorism-related offences.  The police held press conferences to announce
    the arrests, which attracted world-wide attention.  Between June 3 and June
    12, when the first publication ban was imposed, details of the plots were
    disclosed by the police, by CSIS and by defence counsel.  These details were
    widely reported and included allegations that the accused were plotting to
    blow up various public buildings such as the Parliament buildings, that the
    plotters had tons of bomb-making materials and weapons, that they had attended
    terrorist training camps, that they had links with terrorists organizations
    in the United States and Europe, and that they were inspired by al-Qaeda.  Almost
    five thousand articles reported on the arrests and the allegations.</p>

    June 12, 2006, Justice of the Peace Currie imposed a ban on publication of
    proceedings at the bail hearings at the request of one of the accused pursuant
    to s. 517.  Some of the accused did not want a publication ban.  The justice
    ruled that since the accused were jointly charged, the ban applied to the

    Committee on Corrections</i> - <i>Towards Unity: Criminal Justice and Corrections</i> (Ottawa:
    Queen’s Printer, 1969) (the Ouimet Report), which recommended that the <i>Criminal
    Code</i> be amended to provide that the judge or justice make an order prohibiting
    publication of bail hearing proceedings on application by the accused.  However,
    when the extensive amendments to the <i>Code</i> were enacted as part of
    the <i>Bail Reform Act</i>, S.C.&nbsp;1970-71-72, c. 37, the publication
    ban was discretionary.  Then s. 457.2(1) read as follows:</p>

    at the request of the accused and discretionary where the order is sought

    decision of this court in <i>Global Communications</i> arose out of a bail

    of the fugitive and the Attorney General of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    , had made an order banning publication of the bail proceedings.  Global
    Communications then brought an application to quash the order on the basis
    that the judge had no jurisdiction to make the order and, in the alternative,
    that the order infringed s. 2 of the <i>Charter</i>.  Linden J., in reasons
    reported at (1983), 42 O.R. (2d) 13 (H.C.J.), held that the <i>Criminal Code</i> bail
    provisions, including (now) s. 517, apply to extradition proceedings.  Thus,
    the extradition judge had jurisdiction to make the order.  He also held that,
    while the section violated the guarantee of freedom of the press in s. 2(b),
    it was a reasonable limit within the meaning of s. 1 of the <i>Charter</i>.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span

    J.’s decision was founded principally on the theory that the accused’s right
    to a fair trial is paramount to the right of freedom of expression, and on
    the possibility that publication of bail proceedings could threaten trial
    fairness.  Thus, he wrote as follows at pp. 20 and 23:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I have been
    satisfied by the respondent that this limit on freedom of the press contained
    in the <i>Code</i> is a reasonable one. The order banning publication in
    this matter is temporary. Its scope is limited to the evidence given and
    representations made at the bail hearing. The order did not deny anyone access
    to the court-room. Nor was anyone stopped from publishing the result of the
    hearing. The infringement of the applicant's freedom has, thus, been held
    to a minimum.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore,
    it must be recognized that this order, though interfering with freedom of
    the press, protects another interest which is also guaranteed by the Charter.
    That other interest contained in s. 11(d) is the fugitive's right to be
    &quot;presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law in a fair and
    public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal&quot;. To allow publication
    of the banned material may taint the minds of potential jurors with irrelevant,
    inadmissible or unchallenged evidence, damaging the fugitive's ability to
    be fairly tried.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Our courts are
    conscious of the vital role the press plays in the administration of justice
    by exposing all of our processes to necessary public scrutiny. <i>This is

    J.A. agreed with these reasons. He also took the position that the right
    to a fair trial is fragile, and that unrestricted publication of bail proceedings
    would irreparably harm that right. He wrote as follows at p. 625:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Notwithstanding
    that such an order imposes a measure of prior restraint, the restriction
    which s. 457.2(1) authorizes to be placed on the media's right to publish
    or broadcast the evidence given at an accused's bail hearing is, in my opinion,
    a reasonable one in the interests of ensuring that the subsequent trial of
    the accused will be a fair one.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><i>The right
      to a fair trial is a fragile right</i>. It is quite capable of being shattered
      by the kind of publicity that can attend a bail hearing and, once shattered,
      it may, like Humpty Dumpty, be quite impossible to put back together again.
      Often the proceedings at a bail hearing do not attract any particular media
      notice, but when they do, as they have in this case, <i>the risk of prejudice
      to the accused in the matter of his or her subsequent trial can be severe
      in the absence of a mechanism such as that provided in s. 457.2(1) for
      minimizing that prejudice</i> by means of a time-limited restraint on what
      can be published or broadcast about the hearing. In my opinion it is no
      answer at all that the need for such a mechanism might be avoided if only
      our legal system were otherwise and adopted a different approach altogether
      to the safeguarding of a fair trial for the accused. As has been said in
      other words elsewhere by this Court, ultimately our courts must come back
      to our own free and democratic society in applying the test in this regard
      which s. 1 of the Charter requires us to apply. [Emphasis added.]</p>

    Ontario submit that a mootness issue arises in this appeal.  Following bail
    proceedings that resulted in some but not all of the accused being released
    on bail, the accused appeared for their preliminary inquiries.  The presiding
    judge made orders prohibiting publication of the evidence at the preliminary
    inquiries pursuant to s. 539 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> and s. 110 of the <i>Youth
    Criminal Justice Act, </i>S.C. 2002, c. 1.  The preliminary inquiry proceedings
    were terminated when the Crown filed a direct indictment in the Superior
    Court of Justice.  On September 24, 2007, the accused appeared in the Superior
    Court of Justice.  At that time, Dawson J. made a 30 day interim discretionary
    publication ban order covering all proceedings in the Ontario Court of Justice,
    including the bail proceedings.  The media were given notice that they had
    30 days to challenge this order.  No member of the media challenged the order
    and on October 22, 2007, the Superior Court of Justice extended the discretionary
    order until the end of trial.  </p>

    adversarial relationship still exists between the appellants and
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  As was said in <i>Borowski</i> at p. 359, even if the litigant no longer
    has a direct interest in the outcome, “there may be collateral consequences
    of the outcome that will provide the necessary adversarial context”.  Although
    the initial mandatory orders have been overtaken by the discretionary order,
    the constitutionality of s. 517 remains a live issue between the parties.  Members
    of the media are keenly interested in having the issue settled and
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    needs to know whether its legislation is valid.  The issue will have to be
    determined at some point and this court has had the benefit of full factums
    and complete oral argument.  Moreover, in the arguments before Dawson J.
    concerning the discretionary orders, reference was made to the fact that
    the mandatory bans were already in place and would be frustrated if a discretionary
    order were not put in place. As he said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>There have also
    been section 517 orders made in a number of bail hearings and bail reviews.  Again,
    at least some of those orders, if not all, were mandatory pursuant to the
    provisions of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  They would also be undermined and
    frustrated.</p>

style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    case is an excellent vehicle for testing the validity of the provision, not
    only because of the submissions of the parties, but particularly because
    of the submissions of the accused. Several of the accused argue against the
    mandatory publication ban.  As the appellants point out, this provides an
    important dimension that may be missing in a subsequent case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    second factor, concern for judicial economy, is met where “the special circumstances
    of the case make it worthwhile to apply scarce judicial resources to resolve
    it” (<i>Borowski</i> at p. 360).  One special circumstance is where the court’s
    decision will have some practical effect on the rights of the parties even
    if it will not determine the controversy that gave rise to the action.  This
    is such a case.  As already mentioned, the parties have an interest in the
    validity of s. 517, since the issue is bound to arise again.  As well, “expenditure
    of judicial resources is considered warranted in cases which although moot
    are of a recurring nature but brief duration” (<i>Borowski</i> at p. 360).  The
    question of publication bans at bail hearings will continue to arise. However,
    the time frame during which bans will be of any practical effect will usually
    be too brief for the question to reach this court.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    case is not unlike <i>R. v. Adams</i> (1995), 103 C.C.C. (3d) 262 (S.C.C.),
    where the court considered the validity of an order lifting a ban on publication
    of the complainant’s name in a sexual assault case.  The court held that
    the case was not moot but indicated that it would have exercised its discretion
    in any event to hear the case since the issue was important and might affect
    future cases.  In <i>Borowski</i> at p. 361, the court noted that there exists “a
    rather ill-defined basis for justifying the deployment of judicial resources
    in cases which raise an issue of public importance of which a resolution
    is in the public interest. The economics of judicial involvement are weighed
    against the social cost of continued uncertainty in the law.”  This rationale
    applies in this case.  There will continue to be uncertainty about the continuing
    viability of <i>Global Communications </i>in light of the substantial development
    of the law by the Supreme Court of Canada since 1984. </p>

    this is not a case where the limits on the court’s proper law-making function
    require that the court not hear the case.  The issue raised concerns the
    validity of court orders made pursuant to a section of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  The
    case is not a departure from the court’s traditional role.  Moreover, at
    the core of the dispute is the continuing viability of one of this court’s
    own decisions.  This is pre-eminently a matter for this court to rule on.
    Accordingly, I would not give effect to the mootness argument.</p>

    in Justice Gary Trotter’s text, <i>The Law of Bail in Canada</i>, 2<sup>nd</sup> ed.

    Ontario’s province-wide criminal duty counsel programme.  The evidence shows
    that duty counsel conduct most of the bail hearings in the province, and
    that they often prepare for and conduct them under difficult circumstances.  The
    accused have usually been newly arrested. They have limited understanding
    of the court system and the charges facing them, and limited ability to provide
    instructions to counsel.  A significant number of accused may have mental
    health or addiction issues.  Duty counsel operate under serious time constraints,
    and facilities for interviewing and providing information to the accused
    are far from ideal.  In short, counsel have to convey and obtain a great
    deal of information in a very short period, at a time when the accused is
    particularly vulnerable.  Defence counsel is rarely in a position to contest
    the truth of the allegations made by Crown counsel during the bail hearing.</p>

    the concession by the parties that s. 517 infringes s. 2(b), it is important
    to characterize the nature of that infringement.  The ban on publication
    of bail proceedings is only temporary and expires if the accused is discharged
    after a preliminary inquiry or at the end of the trial.  Further, the ban
    does not prevent anyone from attending in court to observe the proceedings.</p>

    the other hand, the ban is mandatory when sought by the accused and all-embracing;
    it prohibits publication of “the evidence taken, the information given or
    the representations made and the reasons, if any, given or to be given by
    the justice”.  Thus, even the reasons for releasing or detaining the accused,

    J. wrote that the “freedom of individuals to discuss information about the
    institutions of government, their policies and practices, is crucial to any
    notion of democratic rule”.  He also observed at para. 20 that “the courts,
    and particularly the criminal courts, play a critical role in any democracy”.  Section
    517 cuts off meaningful and informed public debate about a fundamental aspect
    of the administration of criminal justice, the bail system, at the very time
    that the debate may be most important - when the decision is made to grant
    or deny bail.  It also hinders debate in other circumstances of great public
    interest, as where an accused on bail commits another, perhaps serious crime.
    The public is left to speculate about why the accused was released and the
    justice system is unable to provide a timely and meaningful response because

    s. 517 does not prevent anyone from attending court to witness the operation

    the courts for most of the population.  As has been repeatedly said, very
    few people have the time to attend court proceedings; everyone else must
    depend upon the media for information about the court system.  Section 517
    thus interferes with the effective operation of the principle of open courts.  As

    public access to information about the courts, which in turn permits the

    Ontario agree that this is an objective of the legislation, but also argue
    that the mandatory ban is meant to ensure expeditious show cause hearings.  They
    argue, for example, that requiring the justice to embark on a hearing to
    consider whether a discretionary ban is appropriate after giving notice to
    the media could result in unfair and unreasonable delay in the bail proceedings.  </p>

    in 1976 when the predecessor to s. 517 was enacted since at that time, long
    before <i>Dagenais</i> was decided, there was no requirement to notify the
    media when a ban on publication was contemplated.  They argue that the court
    ought not to consider this additional objective since, in accordance with <i>R.
    v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd.</i> (1985), 18 C.C.C. (3d) 385 (S.C.C.), it is not
    open to the Crown to rely on a shifting purpose that did not motivate those

    my view, the Crown’s position does not attract the prohibition against shifting
    purpose.  <i>R. v.

    <st1:City

    Butler</i> (1992), 70 C.C.C. (3d) 129 (S.C.C.) makes it clear that the court
    is entitled to consider the purpose of the legislation in the broadest sense.  The
    interest in a fair trial embraces not simply the narrow interest of preventing
    potential jurors from being influenced by prejudicial material that might
    be disclosed at a bail hearing, but other interests intended to safeguard
    the accused’s and society’s interest in a fair trial.  Those interests include
    preventing diversion of the accused’s scarce resources to fight opposition
    to a publication ban and preventing delay of the bail hearing.  As regards
    the latter, keeping accused in custody interferes with their ability to defend
    the case.  The objectives of ensuring expeditious bail hearings, avoiding
    unnecessary detention of accused and allowing accused to retain scarce resources
    to defend their cases are all inextricably linked to the objective of ensuring
    a fair trial.  To identify the objectives in this way does not require resort
    to the shifting purpose doctrine:  see

    Peter Hogg points out in <i>Constitutional Law of Canada</i>, 5<sup>th</sup> ed.,
    loose-leaf (
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto: Carswell, 2007), at s. 38.9(a):  “The statement of the objective
    should … be related to the infringement of the Charter, rather than to other
    goals.  In other words, the statement of the objective should supply a reason
    for infringing the Charter right.”  In this case, the infringement is the
    mandatory delay in publication of bail proceedings, including evidence, submissions
    and reasons, upon application by the accused.  I would characterize the objective
    of this infringement as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Section 517
    ensures that accused have a fair trial by an impartial jury, by providing
    the accused with an effective and expeditious means to prevent jurors from
    being exposed to prejudicial information that may be disclosed at the bail
    hearing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    objective is pressing and substantial.  As pointed out in <i>Dagenais</i> at
    p. 879, the accused’s right to a fair trial is of such importance that it
    has been entrenched in ss. 7 and 11(d) of the <i>Charter</i>.  The public
    also has an interest in a fair trial and the courts have “an interest in
    ensuring that justice [is] done, and an interest in safeguarding the repute
    of the administration of justice by ensuring that justice [is] seen to be
    done”.  The mandatory publication ban in s. 517 also helps protect the accused’s
    liberty interest by allowing for an expeditious resolution of the bail issue.  As
    I will discuss later, a discretionary ban imposed under s. 517 on application
    of the Crown or at common law at the request of the accused or the Crown
    could have other objectives.  The issue at this point is the constitutionality
    of the mandatory ban and that, in my view, can only be justified on fair
    trial grounds.</p>

    must show “a causal connection between the infringement and the benefit sought
    on the basis of reason or logic”.  This causal relationship may be established
    by expert evidence, but such evidence is not always required, especially
    where the legislation is directed at changing human behaviour (<i>RJR-MacDonald</i> at
    para. 154). As McLachlin J. noted at para. 137 of <i>RJR-MacDonald</i>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Discharge of
    the civil standard does not require scientific demonstration; the balance

    publication ban under consideration must be assessed in accordance with this
    standard.   While there have been studies attempting to measure the impact
    of pre-trial publicity and the effectiveness of remedies such as jury instructions,
    the usefulness of this kind of evidence is open to debate, an issue I will
    return to below. As was said by Bastarache J. in <i>Harper v.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    (Attorney General)</i>, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 827, at para. 77, “Where the court
    is faced with inconclusive or competing social science evidence relating
    the harm to the legislature’s measures, the court may rely on a reasoned
    apprehension of that harm.” In my view this is the type of case where it
    is open to the Crown to establish the rational connection without expert
    evidence.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To
    understand why the rational connection test is met in this case, it is necessary
    to consider the purpose and nature of the bail hearing. As Bastarache J.
    stated in <i>Thomson Newspapers Co. v.
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    (Attorney General)</i>, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 877, at paras. 87-88, proportionality
    of the measures can only be evaluated by paying “close attention to detail
    and factual setting” and characterizing “the context of the impugned provision”:  see
    also <i>R. v. Bryan</i> (2007), 217 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (S.C.C.), at paras. 10
    -11.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Part
    XVI of the <i>Criminal Code</i> deals with bail hearings.  It sets out the
    rules for vindicating the accused’s right to release pending trial where
    appropriate, which finds constitutional protection in s. 11(e) of the <i>Charter</i>,
    which guarantees an accused the right not to be denied reasonable bail without
    just cause.  There are three fundamental aspects of the bail hearing that
    provide the context for considering the application of the proportionality
    test, and especially the rational connection aspect of that test.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    first contextual factor is the scope of just cause for refusing to release
    the accused unconditionally.  Section 515(10) defines just cause as the need
    (a) to ensure the accused’s attendance at court; (b) to protect the safety
    of the public; or (c) to maintain confidence in the administration of justice.  Section
    515(10) thus sets the parameters for relevancy of information and evidence
    that may be adduced at the bail hearing.  Evidence and information that would
    not be relevant at the eventual trial of the accused may be relevant at the
    bail hearing.  For example, the fact that the accused was awaiting trial
    when he was alleged to have committed the offences for which bail is sought
    is highly relevant to all three aspects of just cause.  But, it would only
    be in highly exceptional circumstances that this potentially prejudicial
    information would find its way into a trial.  Similarly, the accused’s criminal
    record, especially a record for similar offences, will be relevant to just
    cause, but the record will be adduced at the trial only in limited and closely
    defined circumstances.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New \(W1\)&quot;;
'>[3]</span></span></span></a>  Other highly prejudicial evidence, such as gang
    affiliation, might well not be admissible at trial but may be relevant to
    just cause and may be adduced at the bail hearing.  Similarly, since the
    protection and safety of the public, including the alleged victim of the
    offence, is an important consideration at the bail hearing, evidence of the
    accused’s relationship with the victim could be adduced at the bail hearing,
    despite the fact that the evidence may be prejudicial and not admissible
    at trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    second contextual factor is the nature of the evidence that can be adduced
    at the bail hearing.  Section 518 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> sets out the
    rules of admissibility at the bail hearing.  Broadly speaking, the court
    may receive all evidence considered credible or trustworthy.  As a result,
    the evidence is not put through the filter of the normal evidence rules that
    would apply at trial.  Thus, for example, the prosecutor may introduce an
    accused’s confession or wiretap evidence without having to establish that
    the evidence was lawfully obtained:  see the discussion of the procedure
    and evidence at the bail hearing in chapter 5 of Trotter J.’s text.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    third contextual factor is the timing of the bail hearing in the criminal
    process.  Of necessity, the bail hearing is ordinarily held at the very earliest
    stages of the proceedings.  Accused have limited information about the allegations
    against them. They often do not have retained counsel and instead rely upon
    duty counsel. They are not in a position to provide full instructions, even
    to retained counsel, about the allegations.  In short, they are in a highly
    vulnerable position and have limited resources available to respond to the
    allegations against them.  Thus, they may not be in a position to contradict
    or explain highly damaging but false allegations that the prosecutor makes
    at the bail hearing.  The accused’s vulnerability at this stage of the proceedings
    is an important contextual factor:  <i>Thomson Newspapers Co. </i>at para.
    90.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>With
    these contextual factors in mind, I return to the objective of the infringing
    measure:  ensuring that the accused has effective and expeditious means to
    prevent jurors from obtaining prejudicial information that could preclude
    a fair trial.  There is a logical causal relationship between this objective
    and the mandatory publication ban.  Section 517 prevents information that
    could be highly prejudicial and inadmissible at trial from being disseminated
    to the public, some of whom will ultimately make up the jury in the accused’s
    case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    mandatory nature of the prohibition enhances its effectiveness for this purpose.  At
    the early stage of the bail hearing, the accused is not in a position to
    make effective submissions in favour of a discretionary ban.  Accused have
    only a limited understanding of the case against them; their counsel, often
    duty counsel, will not be in a position to make informed submissions about
    whether evidence such as the accused’s confession, criminal record or history
    with the victim will be admissible at the trial.  Counsel cannot know with
    certainty whether the accused will be tried by a jury. Even where there is
    no possibility of a jury trial, as in summary conviction proceedings, the
    proceedings may be a precursor to more serious indictable proceedings. Neither
    can counsel know whether the trial will be relatively soon, while information
    about the bail hearing is fresh in the potential jurors’ minds.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    mandatory ban also serves the important interest of ensuring an expeditious
    bail hearing.  If the accused were required to make submissions in favour
    of a discretionary ban, a judge might well need to adjourn the hearing so
    the accused may properly instruct counsel and obtain further information.  Adjournments
    for this purpose would frustrate the objective of ensuring the accused have
    access to an <i>expeditious</i> method of protecting their fair trial rights.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    media fairly make the point that there is limited empirical evidence to demonstrate
    the impact of pre-trial publicity of any kind, let alone bail proceedings,
    on jurors’ ability to give the accused a fair trial.  They point to the presumption
    that jurors will obey their oaths and will try the accused based only on
    the evidence admitted in court in accordance with the trial judge’s instructions.  Cory
    J. explained this presumption in his concurring reasons in <i>Phillips v.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Nova Scotia (Commission of Inquiry into the Westray Mine Tragedy)</i>, [1995]
    2 S.C.R. 97. It was argued in that case that a commission of inquiry into
    a highly publicized event should be stayed until after the related criminal
    trial.  Cory J. stated at para. 133:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I am of the
    view that this objective [of a fair trial] is readily attainable in <i>the
    vast majority of criminal trials</i> even in the face of a great deal of
    publicity. The jury system is a cornerstone of our democratic society. The
    presence of a jury has for centuries been the hallmark of a fair trial. I
    cannot accept the contention that increasing mass media attention to a particular
    case has made this vital institution either obsolete or unworkable. There
    is no doubt that extensive publicity can prompt discussion, speculation,
    and the formation of preliminary opinions in the minds of potential jurors.
    However, the strength of the jury has always been the faith accorded to the
    good will and good sense of the individual jurors in any given case. [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    the fact that a fair trial is obtainable in the vast majority of criminal
    trials, even in the face of considerable pre-trial publicity, does not, in
    my view, undermine the rational connection.  Stating the proposition in this
    manner concedes that there may be some cases where a fair trial will not
    be possible despite jury instructions and the other measures that may be
    employed, such as adjournment of the trial, challenge for cause and change
    of venue.  Cory J. acknowledged this in <i>Phillips,</i> pointing out at
    para. 134 that one risk the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Nova Scotia government took in proceeding with the inquiry while criminal
    charges were outstanding was that the charges would be stayed if a fair trial
    could not be achieved.  At the bail hearing stage it may be difficult to
    identify with reasonable certainty those cases where fair trial interests
    will be undermined by publication of the bail proceedings: see <i>R. v. Daly</i> (2003),
    178 C.C.C. (3d) 31 (B.C.S.C.), at para. 69, affirmed (2005), 198 C.C.C. (3d)
    185 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ). A mandatory ban is therefore rationally connected to the aim of preventing
    juror tainting at a stage where it is difficult to assess the risk of an
    unfair trial based on prejudicial pre-trial publicity.</p>

    wish to briefly discuss the empirical information available concerning the
    impact of pre-trial publicity. I will revisit this evidence later, when considering
    the actual salutary effects of the legislation.  As is well known, Dickson
    C.J. was sceptical about the value of this research seeking to demonstrate
    that juries are unable to properly disregard potentially prejudicial information.  As
    he said in <i>R. v. Corbett,</i> [1988] 1 S.C.R. 670, at pp. 693-94:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>We
      should maintain our strong faith in juries which have, in the words of
      Sir William Holdsworth, &quot;for some hundreds of years been constantly
      bringing the rules of law to the touchstone of contemporary common sense&quot; (Holdsworth, <i>A
      History of English Law</i> (7th ed. 1956), vol. I, at p. 349).</span></p>

    similar reasons, Barry J. in <i>R. v. Kenny</i> (1991), 68 C.C.C. (3d) 36
    (Nfld. T.D.), at pp. 49-60 was of the view that the empirical research was
    of limited value.  However, at p. 197 of his text, Trotter J. points to more
    recent studies than those referred to in <i>Corbett</i> and <i>Kenny</i> as
    suggesting that the negative impact of pre-trial publicity may be more profound
    than previously suspected.  He writes as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>However, social
    science research suggests that our assumptions about how jurors are affected
    by adverse information relating to the accused person may be misplaced.  A
    growing body of empirical literature supports the view that jurors are easily
    biased by learning of prejudicial information about the accused person.  Moreover,
    instructions to disregard this prejudicial information are shown to be largely
    inefficacious.  It may be necessary to reconsider the current orthodoxy relating
    to jury instructions.  [Footnotes omitted.]</p>

    my view, it is difficult to draw firm conclusions on the impact of pre-trial
    publicity from the empirical material. I will elaborate on this issue further
    below; at this point, it is sufficient for me to conclude that this is a
    case where the government should be entitled to rely upon reason or logic.  In
    short, it is reasonable to believe that, in some cases, disclosure of material
    from the bail hearing could negatively affect potential jurors.  As Cory
    J. said in <i>Phillips</i> at para. 125, “Perhaps science will one day be
    able to prove that in certain situations juror prejudice is inescapable.  Until
    that time, common sense must provide guidance in these decisions.”</p>

    second element of the proportionality test is the minimal impairment analysis.  The
    test at this stage is whether the mandatory prohibition in s. 517 abridges
    freedom of expression as little as is reasonably possible or, put another
    way, whether “the law falls within a range of reasonable alternatives”: see <i>RJR-MacDonald </i>at
    para. 160.  So framed, the test necessarily requires the court to pay deference
    to choices made by Parliament even when imposing prior restraints on freedom
    of expression. That said, the Supreme Court of Canada has emphasized the
    importance of minimizing interference with information about the functioning
    of the courts.  As Cory J. said in

    groups – namely, the claim of accused to a fair trial by an impartial jury
    uncontaminated by prejudicial and inadmissible evidence, and the claim of
    the press and the public to information.  To paraphrase the words of the
    majority of the court in <i>Irwin Toy Ltd. v. Quebec (Attorney General)</i>,
    [1989] 1 S.C.R. 927, at 994, the question is whether Parliament “had a reasonable
    basis, on the evidence tendered, for concluding that the [temporary mandatory
    ban on publication] impaired freedom of expression as little as possible
    given the government’s pressing and substantial objective”. In my view, there
    is a reasonable basis to conclude that a mandatory ban impairs freedom of
    expression as little as reasonably possible in order to meet the objective
    of ensuring that the accused has an effective and expeditious means to prevent
    jurors from obtaining prejudicial information that could be disclosed at
    a bail hearing but would preclude a fair trial.  </p>

    will review a number of less impairing alternatives to show why these alternatives
    would not adequately achieve the law’s objective. First, the media suggest
    that a less rights-impairing solution is to allow for a time limited publication
    ban, pending a hearing to determine if the ban should continue.  In the meantime,
    the bail hearing would proceed.  It seems to me, however, that this proposed
    solution ignores the contextual factors discussed above and places the accused
    in an invidious position.  Without knowing whether or not the publication
    ban will be in place, the accused cannot know whether to take the risk of
    contesting bail to possibly obtain the immediate reward of release at the
    cost of the more serious risk of poisoning the minds of jurors at the subsequent
    trial.  Either accused wait until the publication ban issue has been finally
    determined, or they forego the bail application until they are in a better
    position to make reasoned submissions in accordance with the <i>Dagenais </i>test.  This
    would have a detrimental effect on an accused’s liberty interest. As Martin
    L. Friedland said in<i> Detention Before Trial: A Study of Criminal Cases
    Tried in the Toronto Magistrates’ Court </i>(Toronto: University of Toronto
    Press, 1965), at p. 172, “The law should abhor any unnecessary deprivation
    of liberty and positive steps should be taken to ensure that detention before
    trial is kept to a minimum” (footnote omitted).</p>

style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The “certainty” argument
    in favour of mandatory prohibitions in bail hearings is similar to the rationale
    used to uphold the mandatory ban in sexual assault cases in <i>Canadian Newspapers
    Co. v.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    (Attorney General)</i>, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 122.  In that case, the court held
    that only the certainty provided by a mandatory ban preventing publication
    of the identity of the complainant could achieve Parliament’s objective of
    encouraging the reporting of sexual offences.  As the court said at p. 132:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Obviously, since
    fear of publication is one of the factors that influences the reporting of
    sexual assault, certainty with respect to non-publication <u>at the time
    of deciding whether to report</u> plays a vital role in that decision. Therefore,
    a discretionary provision under which the judge retains the power to decide
    whether to grant or refuse the ban on publication would be counterproductive,
    since it would deprive the victim of that certainty. Assuming that there
    would be a lesser impairment of freedom of the press if the impugned provision
    were limited to a discretionary power, it is clear, in my view, that such
    a measure would not, however, achieve Parliament's objective, but rather
    defeats it. <span

    may also be placed in a position that deprives them of other constitutional
    rights.  For example, they may have to seek to adjourn their trial until
    the sting of publicity has faded, thus foregoing their s. 11(b) rights to
    a trial within a reasonable time.  Alternatively, accused may have to waive
    their s. 11(f) right to a jury trial, in order to obtain a trial within a
    reasonable time.    </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    second possible means of impairing the right as little as possible would
    be to permit publication of the bail proceedings at the time but impose a
    discretionary ban closer to the trial.  This is a serious alternative to
    the mandatory ban effective at the time of the bail hearing, and it is not
    without some doubt that I hold that the government has nevertheless met the
    minimal impairment test.  The alternative of a future publication ban does
    not meet the problem that accused need some certainty in order to decide
    how to conduct the bail hearing.  The notion of a future publication ban
    also does not meet the problem of intense media attention given to the information
    from the bail hearing when the trial will occur soon after the bail hearing,
    perhaps because the accused ends up being detained in custody.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Further,
    as Hogg cautions at s. 38.11(b), courts must be aware of the “practicalities
    of designing and administering a regulatory regime” and cannot be “indifferent
    to considerations of cost”.  Requiring an accused to fight for a discretionary
    ban at any time involves expenditure of scare resources that could be better
    used to defend the case.</p>

    final alternative would be to impose a limited discretionary ban on only
    prejudicial evidence, such as the accused’s confession and other presumptively
    inadmissible evidence.  The concern here is that at the bail hearing stage,
    where there is only limited disclosure, the accused has had only a limited
    opportunity to consult counsel, and the rules of admissibility are relaxed,
    it will be difficult for the accused and counsel, usually duty counsel, to
    know what information will be prejudicial.  To require counsel and the justice
    of the peace to sort through the information at this early stage could result
    in delay.  Further, such a ban would still not solve the difficulties of
    coping with intervention by the media; the potentially prejudicial material
    may be the very information the media seek to disclose to the public. In
    fairness, it is probably this information that the public requires to understand
    the bail decision.</p>

    said, I will consider these alternatives again when I deal with the final
    element of the proportionality test, which requires the court to measure
    the salutary and deleterious effects of the mandatory ban.  The fact that
    there exist alternatives to the mandatory ban that would have a less detrimental
    effect on freedom of expression is an important consideration when measuring
    the salutary effects of the measure.</p>

    final element of the proportionality test requires that the court be satisfied
    that the effects of the limiting measure are proportionate to the objectives,
    and that the actual salutary effects of the law outweigh its deleterious
    effects.  In my view, it is here that s.&nbsp;517 fails.  In <i>Dagenais,</i> Lamer
    C.J., although considering the test for imposition of a common law publication
    ban, discussed at length this third element of the proportionality test under
    s. 1.  He made the following points at pp. 887-89:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In many instances,
    the imposition of a measure will result in the full, or nearly full, realization
    of the legislative objective. In these situations, the third step of the
    proportionality test calls for an examination of the balance that has been
    struck between the objective in question and the deleterious effects on constitutionally
    protected rights arising from the means that have been employed to achieve
    this objective.  At other times, however, the measure at issue, while rationally
    connected to an important objective, will result in only the partial achievement
    of this object. In such cases, I believe that the third step of the second
    branch of the <i>Oakes</i> test requires both that the underlying <u>objective</u> of
    a measure and the <u>salutary effects</u> that actually result from its implementation
    be proportional to the deleterious effects the measure has on fundamental
    rights and freedoms...<i>[E]ven if the importance of the <u>objective itself</u> (when
    viewed in the abstract) outweighs the deleterious effects on protected rights,
    it is still possible that the actual <u>salutary effects</u> of the legislation
    will not be sufficient to justify these negative effects</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[I]n appropriate
    cases it is necessary to measure the actual salutary effects of impugned
    legislation against its deleterious effects, rather than merely considering
    the proportionality of the objective itself.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I believe that
    even if an objective is of sufficient importance, the first two elements
    of the proportionality test are satisfied, and the deleterious effects are
    proportional to the objectives, it is still possible that, because of a lack
    of proportionality between the deleterious effects and the salutary effects,
    a measure will not be reasonable and demonstrably justified in a free and
    democratic society. [Underlining in original; italics added.]</p>

    the result, Lamer C.J. rephrased this last part of the proportionality test
    as follows at p. 889:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>there must be
    a proportionality between the deleterious effects of the measures which are
    responsible for limiting the rights or freedoms in question and the objective, <u>and

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Or,
    as it was put by Hogg at s. 38.12, this third element of the proportionality
    tests requires “a balancing of the objective sought by the law against the
    infringement of the <i>Charter</i>.  It asks whether the Charter infringement
    is too high a price to pay for the benefit of the law.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    deal with the first part of the test:  is there proportionality between the
    deleterious effects of the mandatory publication ban and the objective?  Given
    that the ban is only temporary and that the court proceedings themselves
    are open to the press and the public, I think it is arguable that the effects
    of the mandatory ban are proportionate to the objectives.  As Lamer C.J.
    pointed out in <i>Dagenais</i> at p. 890, when considering this element of
    the proportionality test it is important to bear in mind that the pressing
    and substantial objective at issue, preserving the accused’s fair trial right,
    is itself a fundamental right and “as such, it is a matter of exceptional
    importance”.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Where
    the mandatory ban fails the s. 1 test is the requirement of proportionality
    between the deleterious and the salutary effects of the measure.  In my view,
    the deleterious effects of s. 517 are substantial and the salutary effects
    are in many respects speculative and limited.</p>

    then are the deleterious effects of the mandatory publication ban in s. 517
    on freedom of expression?  First, the ban prohibits publication of all information,
    evidence, and submissions, even those that could not possibly affect the
    accused’s fair trial. The ban also prohibits publication of this material
    where alternative measures such as challenge for cause, change of venue,
    and strong judicial directions could eliminate risk to a fair trial.  All
    that can be published is the fact of the bail hearing and the result:  see <i>Daly</i> at

    the ban prohibits the publication of the reasons of the justice or judge
    for releasing or detaining the accused, even reasons that are carefully measured
    to explain the decision but not interfere with the accused’s fair trial rights.  This
    is, in my view, a serious infringement of freedom of expression, especially
    in high visibility cases. The public is left to wonder, for example, why
    in light of the serious allegations made against the accused at the pre-hearing
    press conference a justice or judge nevertheless released the accused.  As
    Berger J.A. said in <i>R. v. White</i> (2005), 376 A.R. 63 (C.A.), (<i>White</i> #

      in the bail system. This is the case both at the time the initial decision
      is made, and later where subsequent events may raise questions as to the
      wisdom of that decision, as when the accused who is on bail commits further
      offences. The fact that an accused was on bail when he or she committed

        has a right to know if such remarks are made yet if there is no right
        to publish, the judge's comments may be hidden from public view. <i>Thus
        it can be seen that the effect of s. 30(1) is to repress the publication

    to account.  As Doherty J.A. said at para. 40 of <i>R. v. Domm</i> (1996),
    111 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (

    ban on publication stifles informed public participation in one of the crucial
    aspects of the criminal justice system.  As Cory J. said in <i>Edmonton Journal </i>at
    p. 1340, “Discussion of court cases and constructive criticism of court proceedings
    is dependent upon the receipt by the public of information as to what transpired
    in court.  Practically speaking, this information can only be obtained from

    in the case of jointly charged accused, as in this case, the publication
    ban infringes the rights of those co-accused who did not wish the ban.  Such
    a ban infringes the interests of those accused to a public hearing.  While
    the constitutional right to a public hearing as guaranteed by s.&nbsp;11(d)

    court process, which includes media access to the courtroom and reporting

    as a result of the ban on publication of proceedings at the bail hearing,
    individuals with helpful information might not learn about the case.  Such
    information might be important to the defence or the prosecution, but might
    never come to light or may not come to light until much later in the proceedings,
    perhaps at the trial, leading to disruption of the proceedings when the parties
    must attempt to investigate the new information:  see <i>Dagenais</i> at

    I referred to research discussed by Trotter J. in his text. It is difficult
    to draw firm conclusions from this material.  As an example, one of the most
    ambitious studies, Amy Otto et al., “The Biasing Impact of Pretrial Publicity
    on Juror Judgments” (1994) 18 Law and Human Behaviour 453, provided subjects
    with simulated press reports immediately before they viewed an edited videotape
    of an actual trial.  The researchers concluded at p. 464 that the results
    demonstrated that pre-trial publicity does have an impact, with the strongest
    effects being from negative pre-trial publicity about the accused’s character.
    This study and other studies referenced by Trotter J. tend to deprecate the
    efficacy of jury instructions; some studies actually show that jury instructions
    can aggravate the prejudicial impact of certain kinds of information.<a

    Human Behavior 409, found at pp. 431-32 that even relatively short delays
    (in this study 12 days) “eliminated bias created by exposure to factually
    biasing publicity”.  The delay did not have the same impact on what the authors
    refer to as “emotionally biasing”
    information.  Factually biasing publicity is publicity that contains information
    bearing on the perceived guilt of the accused.  Emotionally biasing publicity
    is publicity that arouses the emotions of the public but has no direct evidentiary
    relevance.  Examples of the former are reports of a confession, prior criminal
    record, or inadmissible but relevant evidence.  This is the kind of material
    that is most likely to be raised at a bail hearing.  Examples of emotionally
    biasing publicity would be graphic or lurid depictions of the murder victim’s
    injuries or information that creates a climate of fear, such as publicity
    surrounding a series of child murders.<a href="#_ftn7"

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The risk is that
    wide publication of the evidence given at a preliminary inquiry may so influence
    the minds of prospective jurors that they will approach their duties with

    in the community will be so aroused that members of a trial jury will be
    intimidated by the force of public opinion. <i>We have grave doubts that
    this is a real risk</i>. In the first place, at the time of a preliminary
    inquiry no one, including the jurors, knows who the jurors at the trial will
    be. In metropolitan areas the public memory is very short and individuals
    are largely anonymous. Few members of the public can remember what they have
    read or heard about a particular case for many days, let alone months. In
    less populous areas gossip and rumour spread more easily, but gossip and
    rumour thrive on secrecy. <i>It is much more likely that vicious and inaccurate
    gossip and rumour will be spread throughout a community by individuals who
    claim to have knowledge than by a fair and accurate report by news media</i>.

    granting the possibility that pre-trial publicity can influence jury behaviour,
    this would only be the case in the most unusual instances, being cases where
    a single powerful piece of inadmissible evidence comes to the attention of
    the jury pool at a time proximate enough to the trial to have an impact  For
    example, in <i>Phillips</i> at para. 162, Cory J. suggested that rather than
    a stay of the public inquiry, an appropriate remedy would be a ban on publication
    of the accused’s testimony at the inquiry to prevent potential jurors from
    being exposed to testimony that they might never hear at the trial.  An accused’s
    confession might fall within the same category:  see

      from a psychologist on the impact of the pre-trial publicity. It was the
      psychologists’ opinion that pre-trial publicity is unlikely to negatively
      impact the impartiality of jurors except where a single piece of information
      that essentially decides the case is disclosed to jurors before trial but
      not adduced at trial: see the Court of Queen’s Bench decision at para.

    cases where a single piece of highly prejudicial but inadmissible evidence
    is led at a bail hearing, it should be possible to craft remedial measures
    to ensure that the accused will receive a fair trial; for example, a ban
    on publication of that piece of evidence, a publication ban proximate to
    the trial, challenge for cause or change of venue.  An example of a remedial
    measure can be seen in <i>R. v. Lake</i>, [1997] O.J. No. 5446 (Gen. Div.),
    at para. 24. In that case, a witness sought a ban on publication of his testimony
    because he was to be tried for the same offence a year later.  McCombs J.

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In my view,

    hand, once the present trial has been completed, the analysis changes.  After
    this trial is over, the right of the press to publish further accounts of
    it assumes much less importance, while at the same time, the risk of prejudice
    to the fairness of [the witness’s] pending trial becomes substantially greater,
    particularly if there is continuing sustained publicity of [the witness’s]

    from judges in Canada and other common law jurisdictions is virtually uniform
    that the impact of pre-trial publicity is speculative and that other measures

    protect the accused’s fair trial rights:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>To
      begin, I doubt that jurors are always adversely influenced by publications.
      There is no data available on this issue. However, common sense dictates
      that in some cases jurors may be adversely affected. Assuming this, I nevertheless
      believe that jurors are capable of following instructions from trial judges
      and ignoring information not presented to them in the course of the criminal
      proceedings: <i>Dagenais</i> at p. 884, per Lamer C.J.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>[T]his
      Court [in <i>R. v. Corbett</i>] has strongly endorsed the ability of a
      jury to follow the explicit instructions of a judge. This endorsement surely
      applies as much to the instruction to ignore all information not presented
      in the course of the criminal proceedings as it applies to the instruction
      to use evidence of prior convictions for one purpose and not another: <i>Dagenais</i> at
      p. 885, per Lamer C.J.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The risk of
    prejudice to an accused’s fair trial rights from pre-trial publicity is highly
    speculative: <i>Phillips</i> at para. 34, per L’Heureux-Dubé J.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I cannot accept
    the contention that increasing mass media attention to a particular case
    has made this vital institution either obsolete or unworkable. There is no
    doubt that extensive publicity can prompt discussion, speculation, and the
    formation of preliminary opinions in the minds of potential jurors. However,
    the strength of the jury has always been the faith accorded to the good will
    and good sense of the individual jurors in any given case:  <i>Phillips </i>at
    para. 133, per Cory J.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>There is a feature
    of our trial system which is sometimes overlooked or taken for granted. The
    collective experience of this constitution as well as the previous constitution
    of the court, both when we were in practice at the Bar and judicially, has
    demonstrated to us time and time again, that juries up and down the country
    have a passionate and profound belief in, and a commitment to, the right
    of a Defendant to be given a fair trial. They know that it is integral to
    their responsibility. It is, when all is said and done, their birthright,
    it is shared by each one of them with the Defendant. They guard it faithfully.
    The integrity of the jury is an essential feature of our trial process. Juries
    follow the directions which the judge will give them to focus exclusively
    on the evidence and to ignore anything they may have heard or read out of
    court. No doubt in this case Butterfield J. will give appropriate directions,
    tailor-made to the individual facts in the light of any trial post the sentencing
    hearing, after hearing submissions from counsel for the Defendants. We cannot
    too strongly emphasise that the jury will follow them, not only because they
    will loyally abide by the directions of law which they will be given by the
    judge, but also because the directions themselves will appeal directly to
    their own instinctive and fundamental belief in the need for the trial process
    to be fair: <i>R. v. B.</i>, [2006] EWCA Crim 2692 (C.A. Crim. Div.), at
    para.&nbsp;31, per Judge J.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>But the entire
    system of trial by jury is based upon the assumption that the jury will follow
    the instructions which they receive from the trial judge and that they will
    return a true verdict in accordance with the evidence:  <i>Montgomery v.
    HM Advocate and another</i>, [2003] 1 A.C. 641 (P.C.), at p.&nbsp;674, per

    its Working Paper 56, <i>Public and Media Access to the Criminal Process</i> (Ottawa,
    1987), the Law Reform Commission recommended repeal of the mandatory publication
    ban in what is now s. 517, taking the view at p. 76 that this provision and
    the similar provision banning publication of preliminary inquiry proceedings “are
    overly restrictive of freedom of expression” and “constitute an unjustifiable
    intrusion on the principle of maximum openness”.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    further point attenuating the salutary effect of the publication ban of material
    from the bail hearing is that such a ban has no effect on other pre-trial
    publicity, some of which may be more inflammatory than the generally factual
    information presented at the bail hearing.  Bail hearings that the media
    are most likely to want to publicize are the very ones that are most likely
    to be attended by substantial pre-trial publicity, as in this case.  A ban
    on publication of the bail hearing proceedings prevents re-publication of
    this information at a time proximate to the trial.  However, such a ban has
    no impact on the media’s ability to re-publish other material revealed at
    the time of the arrest or acquired outside the bail hearing in the months
    following the initial arrest.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[96]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    second and most significant salutary effect of the mandatory publication
    ban is the avoidance of delay and expense for an accused who seeks the publication
    ban.  Because the s. 517 ban is available simply upon request, the accused
    need not establish any basis for the order and the court need not take any
    steps to notify the media.  If the mandatory ban in s. 517 is struck down,
    an accused seeking a discretionary ban would have to meet the test set out
    in <i>Dagenais</i> at p. 878 or <i>Mentuck</i> at para. 32 and show that
    the ban is necessary to prevent “a real and substantial risk to the fairness
    of the trial” or “a serious risk to the proper administration of justice”.  In <i>Mentuck</i>,
    the court also held at para. 34 that “it must be a risk the reality of which
    is well-grounded in the evidence”.  The accused must show that reasonably
    available alternative measures will not prevent the risk and that the salutary
    effects of the ban outweigh the deleterious effects to freedom of expression.  The
    Crown faces the same test when it seeks a discretionary ban under s. 517.  </p>

    am not convinced that the delay and other problems suggested by the government
    and the accused are as serious as argued.  First, as to notice, the justice
    has a discretion whether to give notice and the form of notice: <i>Dagenais </i>at
    p. 869.  Given the need for an expedited bail hearing to avoid the unwarranted
    detention of the accused, it would seem to me that in most cases the justice
    need not give notice to the media.  Such an approach appears to be authorized
    by <i>Named Person v. Vancouver Sun</i>, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 253 where the court
    held, at paras. 53-54, that notice need not be given every time an <i>in
    camera</i> proceeding is to take place :</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span lang=EN>The
      decision to post a public notice regarding the existence of the proceeding
      is a matter of discretion on the part of the judge. <i>In other words,
      no one has a right, constitutional or otherwise, to be informed of all
      situations in which informer privilege is claimed</i>. The reason for this
      is simply practical: there is no real difference -- <i>vis-à-vis</i> the
      open court principle -- between a situation in which informer privilege
      exists and any other situation in which some part of a proceeding takes
      place <i>in camera</i> -- be it a situation of a child sexual assault victim,
      or a situation involving solicitor-client privilege. <i>It would be unworkable
      and unreasonable to expect that literally every time an in camera proceeding
      is taking place, a judge has the obligation to publicize its existence
      and invite submissions from all comers</i> on whether that proceeding should
      be held <i>in camera</i>. Nor should a judge choose &quot;worthy&quot; interveners.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><i><span
lang=EN>Instead, the judge retains discretion as to whether or not to provide
        public notice </span></i><span lang=EN>of the <i>in camera</i> proceeding
        involving informer privilege. The exercise of the discretion will depend
        on the circumstances, such as whether the holder of the privilege is
        present and plays an active role in court, for instance, as was the case
        here. Whether the judge issues notice, or (as can certainly happen) the
        media independently learns of the existence of the <i>in camera</i> proceeding,
        the next step in the procedure is to hear submissions to determine the
        extent of the need for <i>in camera</i> proceedings. It is at this point
        that the media is granted standing to present arguments on how informer
        privilege can be respected with minimal effect on the open court principle.  [Emphasis

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Similarly,
    it would be unworkable and unreasonable to expect that every time an accused
    applies for a ban on publication at a show cause hearing, the justice of
    the peace has the obligation to halt the proceedings and somehow give notice
    to the media.  Hundreds of show cause hearings take place in this country
    every day.  Even if accused sought publication bans in a small percentage
    of those cases, it is simply not practicable to expect justices of the peace
    to give notice.  It is important that bail hearings proceed expeditiously,
    and this will usually require that no notice of the accused’s application
    is given.</p>

    to the issue of the accused needing time to gather
    “evidence” of the risk to trial fairness or the administration of justice,
    this issue must be put in context.  As already noted, the strict rules of
    evidence do not apply at bail hearings.  In my view, in considering whether
    to impose a publication ban, the justice of the peace is entitled to act
    upon the kind of information that can be received on a bail hearing, being
    evidence that is considered credible and trustworthy.  It is not unusual
    for evidence to be presented through statements of facts read out by Crown
    counsel.  It would seem to me that the justice of the peace would be entitled
    to act upon submissions of counsel in deciding whether or not to impose a
    publication ban.  It is not practicable to expect the party seeking the order
    to adduce the kind of evidence that might be admissible at a trial, in accordance
    with the normal rules of evidence.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown argues that a third salutary effect of the publication ban is the prevention
    of witness contamination.  The Supreme Court of Canada has rejected mere
    assertions that pre-trial publicity taints potential witnesses in the search
    warrant context.  I can see no reason to believe that the situation is any
    different where the information is disclosed at the bail hearing.  In <i>Toronto
    Star Newspapers Ltd. v. Ontario</i>, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 188 at para. 36, the
    Crown relied upon an assertion from a police officer that disclosure of material
    in an information to obtain a search warrant could taint witnesses. Fish
    J., speaking for the court at paras. 37-39, adopted this court’s reasons
    for rejecting this broad assertion:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In Doherty J.A.'s
    view, if that general proposition were sufficient to obtain a sealing order,</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'>... the
    presumptive rule would favour secrecy and not openness prior to trial. A
    general assertion that public disclosure may distract from the ability of
    the police to get at the truth by tainting a potential witness's statement
    is no more valid than the equally general and contrary assertion that public
    disclosure enhances the ability of the police to get at the truth by causing
    concerned citizens to come forward with valuable information.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    fourth, and related, salutary effect is the protection of ongoing criminal
    investigations. The public incidentally benefits from the mandatory ban sought
    by an accused where there are ongoing investigations that could be compromised
    because of information disclosed at the bail hearing. Because the ban is
    mandatory at the insistance of the accused, the Crown need not seek its own
    ban and therefore need not publicly disclose that other investigations are
    extant. However, this issue of compromising ongoing investigations can be
    dealt with by a more limited ban on application by the Crown of only the
    material that could compromise the investigation: see<i> Mentuck</i> at para.&nbsp;46-47.
    In appropriate circumstances, the application could be done <i>in camera</i> as
    was done by this court in <i>R. v. Y. (K.S.)</i> (October 11, 2002) unreported.</p>

style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    fifth incidental salutary effect of the mandatory ban is that character witnesses,
    employers and others who can assist an accused in establishing grounds for
    release may be more likely to come forward, especially for accused charged
    with high-profile or notorious crimes, if they know that their testimony
    would not be published.  Similarly, potential sureties may be more likely
    to testify if they know their testimony can not be published.  On the other
    hand, it is unlikely that the s. 517 prohibition covers the identity of sureties
    and there is no requirement that sureties always testify at the bail hearing.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Sixth,
    a publication ban also advances the privacy interests of the accused, witnesses
    and victims.  While those privacy interests might not be sufficient on their
    own to justify interference with freedom of expression, protection of those
    privacy interests are nevertheless one of the salutary effects of the legislation.  In
    other contexts, privacy interests have been held to justify some limitations
    on freedom of expression: see <i>Edmonton Journal</i> at p. 1345.  In some
    circumstances, protecting privacy interests by banning publication or limiting
    access to court proceedings may advance the search for truth, one of the
    objectives underlying freedom of expression itself: see <i>Canadian Broadcasting
    Corp. </i>at paras. 34 and 38 – 43, and <i>Sierra Club of
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>

    (Minister of Finance)</i>, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 522, at paras. 70 and 77.  Thus,
    a publication ban on bail proceedings could encourage accused to adduce evidence
    of a very private nature, such as evidence about mental health or addiction
    that might assist the court in reaching a correct decision on bail.  That
    said, it is not at all apparent that a mandatory ban in all cases is necessary
    to protect the interests of those few accused. In those few cases counsel
    by articulating the reason for a limited ban would be able to meet the test
    for a discretionary ban.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    was pointed out in <i>Thomson Newspapers Co.</i> at para. 91, a contextual
    factor to be taken into account is the nature of the activity that is infringed.  In <i>R.
    v. Keegstra</i> (1990), 61 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.), Dickson C.J. upheld the
    criminal prohibition on wilful promotion of hatred.  In considering this
    third component of the proportionality test he took into account at p. 66
    that hate speech is “only tenuously connected with the values underlying
    the guarantee of freedom of speech” and that the section was narrowly drawn.  Section
    517 by contrast is broadly drawn and infringes a crucial aspect of the democratic
    commitment.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    question of the efficacy of publication bans does not fit easily under the
    headings of either the salutory or deleterious effects.  In <i>Dagenais</i> at
    p. 886, Lamer C.J. framed the problem in this way: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>It should also
    be noted that recent technological advances have brought with them considerable
    difficulties for those who seek to enforce bans. The efficacy of bans has
    been reduced by the growth of interprovincial and international television
    and radio broadcasts available through cable television, satellite dishes,
    and shortwave radios. It has also been reduced by the advent of information
    exchanges available through computer networks. In this global electronic
    age, meaningfully restricting the flow of information is becoming increasingly
    difficult. Therefore, the actual effect of bans on jury impartiality is substantially
    diminishing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the one hand, the salutory effect of any publication ban is undermined by
    the ease with which the ban can be circumvented.  On the other hand, because
    of the nature of the Internet, information first published at the time of
    the bail hearing is always accessible, right up to the time of the trial.  In
    other words, the court cannot always simply rely upon the fact that time
    will have passed from when the information was first published and that this
    passage of time will lessen any prejudicial effects of the information.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    conclude, in my view, the deleterious effect of the <i>mandatory</i> publication
    ban outweighs the salutary effects.  I appreciate that others might weigh
    the salutory and deleterious factors differently and it is hardly an exact
    science.  However, when one looks at the severity of the deleterious effects
    measured against the speculative nature of many of the claimed salutory effects,
    I am not convinced that the government has met this aspect of the s. 1 test.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    saying this, I have not lost sight of the constitutional dimension to the
    mandatory ban.  In <i>R. v. Pearson</i> (1992), 77 C.C.C. (3d) 124 (S.C.C.),
    Lamer C.J. noted that the presumption of innocence as guaranteed by s. 11(d)
    of the <i>Charter </i>is not confined to the trial requirement that the prosecution
    prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt.  As he said at p. 136, “the starting
    point for any proposed deprivation of life, liberty or security of the person
    of anyone charged with or suspected of an offence must be that the person
    is innocent”.  He also noted at p. 139,
    “Section 11(e) entrenches the effect of the presumption of innocence at the
    bail stage of the criminal process.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    has been little exploration of the procedural content to the right to reasonable
    bail in s. 11(e).  In <i>Pearson</i> at p. 140, Lamer C.J. held that s. 11(e) “creates
    a broad right guaranteeing both the right to obtain bail and the right to
    have that bail set on reasonable terms”.  It would seem to me that an aspect
    of the right to obtain bail is the right to have an expeditious bail hearing
    under circumstances where the accused can adduce evidence necessary to promote
    the right to have bail set on reasonable terms.  The mandatory ban promotes
    the right to an expeditious bail hearing.  Because the accused need not demonstrate
    any basis for the order, there will be no delay while he or she assembles
    what ever information may be necessary to justify the order.  The mandatory
    ban may also assist the accused in assembling witnesses and sureties and
    thus promote the right to have bail set on reasonable terms.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    because the basis for the publication ban can be established through submissions,
    rather than in accordance with the strict rules of evidence, and because
    notice need not be given to the media, I am not persuaded that there will
    be unreasonable delay where an accused seeks a publication ban.  As to the
    problem of being unable to obtain witnesses or sureties without the assurance
    of the publication ban, while I do not doubt that this is a concern in some
    rare cases, it is not a concern that justifies a mandatory ban in all cases.  If
    an accused in a particular case can make out a basis for a limited publication
    ban on those grounds, the appropriate remedy is to grant a discretionary
    ban.</p>

    at length the circumstances in which this court should overrule one of its
    own decisions.  He referred to the five factors that the Supreme Court of
    Canada has articulated that would allow it to overrule one of its previous
    cases as a useful checklist for appellate courts.  He listed those factors
    at para. 124. They may be summarized as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(a)       a
    previous decision does not reflect the values of the <i>Canadian Charter
    of Rights and Freedoms</i>; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(b)       a
    previous decision is inconsistent with or &quot;attenuated&quot; by a later
    decision of the court; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(c)       the
    social, political, or economic assumptions underlying a previous decision
    are no longer valid in contemporary society; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(d)       the

    and, </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(e)       in

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    list, while useful, is not exhaustive.  In the end, this court “will overrule
    our precedents in an appropriate case” (para. 126).  As Laskin J.A. said
    at para. 127:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Instead of focusing
    on phrases such as &quot;manifestly wrong&quot;, the approach I prefer is
    that adopted by this court in <i>R. v. White</i> (1996), 29 O.R. (3d) 577
    (C.A.), at 602. It calls on the court to weigh the advantages and disadvantages
    of correcting the error in a previous decision. This approach focuses on
    the nature of the error, and the effect and future impact of either correcting
    it or maintaining it. In doing so, this approach not only takes into account
    the effect and impact on the parties and future litigants, but also on the
    integrity and administration of our justice system.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[115]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, this is an appropriate case to overrule the decision in <i>Global
    Communications</i>, principally because the decision has been overtaken by
    later decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada dealing with the relationship
    between freedom of expression and the right to a fair trial.  As I have said
    earlier, <i>Global Communications </i>was premised on the theory that, in
    a contest between the accused’s fair trial rights and freedom of expression,
    the accused’s fair trial rights were always paramount.  I have also noted
    that this court took the view that the right to a fair trial was a fragile
    one.  The Supreme Court of Canada has rejected the model of <i>Charter</i> analysis
    based on a hierarchy of rights.  As Lamer C.J. said in <i>Dagenais</i> at
    p. 877:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The pre-<i>Charter</i> common
    law rule governing publication bans emphasized the right to a fair trial
    over the free expression interests of those affected by the ban. In my view,
    the balance this rule strikes is inconsistent with the principles of the <i>Charter</i>,
    and in particular, the equal status given by the <i>Charter</i> to ss. 2(b)
    and 11(d). It would be inappropriate for the courts to continue to apply
    a common law rule that automatically favoured the rights protected by s.
    11(d) over those protected by s. 2(b). A hierarchical approach to rights,
    which places some over others, must be avoided, both when interpreting the <i>Charter</i> and
    when developing the common law. When the protected rights of two individuals
    come into conflict, as can occur in the case of publication bans, <i>Charter</i> principles
    require a balance to be achieved that fully respects the importance of both
    sets of rights.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Dagenais, </i>Lamer
    C.J. also rejected the theory that fair trial rights are so fragile that
    all possible measures must be taken to protect them.  I have set out his
    comments earlier in these reasons.  </p>

    to return to the factors set out in <i>Polowin</i>, in my view it is necessary
    to reconsider <i>Global Communications</i> because that decision does not
    reflect the values of the <i>Charter </i>as they are now understood, and the
    decision is inconsistent with later decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada,
    especially <i>Dagenais</i>.  I accept that other <i>Polowin</i> factors could
    favour refusing to overrule <i>Global Communications</i>; for example, the
    result of overruling arguably establishes a rule less favourable to the accused.  However,
    in my view, the other two factors are so strong in this case that the court
    should reconsider the earlier decision.</p>

    the mandatory ban on publication in s. 517 violated s. 2(b) of the <i>Charter</i> and
    was not a reasonable limit.  He held that the words
    “and shall on application by the accused” (which create the mandatory ban
    on publication on application by the accused) were of no force and effect
    and should be severed from the section.  He suspended the declaration of
    invalidity for 12 months.  However, Brooker J. also held that the provision
    should be amended to open with the words: “Where a jury trial is possible”.  In
    other words, neither the Crown nor the accused could apply for a ban on publication
    under s. 517 where there was no possibility of a jury trial.  Brooker J.
    did not suspend this part of his order.</p>

    Court of Appeal allowed the appeal by the Crown from the judgment of Brooker
    J., finding that the mandatory limitation on publication provided for in
    s. 517 was justified under s. 1 of the <i>Charter</i>.  The court also considered
    at length whether Brooker&nbsp;J. should have heard the motion by the media
    to strike down the legislation.  Those same concerns do not arise in this
    case because of the different context; however, in <i>White # 2</i>, as here,
    it was argued that the <i>Charter</i> issues were largely moot.  The Court
    of Appeal observed at para. 15 that the case might fall within the category
    of cases where the court could properly exercise its discretion to hear the
    motion because the issues are evasive of review.</p>

    court, however, found at para. 16 that the “most problematic aspect” of Brooker
    J.’s decision was his declaration that a restriction of publication can never
    be justified where no jury will be involved.  Since White was charged with
    murder and would be facing a jury trial, the Court of Appeal considered that
    the issue of a publication ban in non-jury cases was not before Brooker J.  The
    court was of the view that Brooker&nbsp;J. was “faced with a factual vacuum
    as far as non-jury trials were concerned” (para. 16).  The possibility that
    the mandatory ban under s. 517 could be justified even where a case is tried
    by a judge alone is referenced several times in the reasons of the Court
    of Appeal.  </p>

    J. found that the Crown had not adduced sufficient evidence to demonstrate
    a rational connection between the mandatory publication ban provided for
    in s. 517 and the objectives of the legislation.  He took a narrow view of
    the objective of the legislation, which he found to relate solely to the
    protection of the accused’s right to a fair trial by an impartial jury.  He
    was not satisfied that facilitating the accused’s right to an expeditious
    bail hearing and reducing the burden of litigation on the accused were objectives
    of the legislation.  As I have already discussed, he also had before him
    expert evidence that pre-trial publicity is unlikely to negatively impact
    the impartiality of jurors, except in cases where a single piece of information
    that essentially decides the cases is given to jurors before a trial but
    not presented at trial.</p>

    Court of Appeal held that Brooker J. had taken too narrow a view of the objectives
    of the ban by holding that the law’s objective was solely to protect the
    accused’s right to a fair trial by an impartial jury.  Slatter J.A., writing
    for the court, identified at para. 36 seven additional objectives “directed
    at preservation of a fair bail hearing and a fair trial”, which I would summarize
    as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(a)       The
    mandatory ban is necessary because placing any burden on the accused undermines
    the presumption of innocence and the right to remain silent.  For example,
    it would be inappropriate to expect an accused to rebut evidence at the bail
    hearing directed at his character, lifestyle and associates prior to trial.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(b)       It
    is unfair to expect the accused to
    “defend his entitlement to judicial interim release on fair terms against
    the interests of the media”.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(c)       It
    is illogical to expect the accused to identify in advance the “specific evidence” that
    would justify a publication ban, especially since bail hearings are conducted
    informally without strict application of the rules of evidence and before
    the Crown has made full disclosure.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(d)       It
    would be impossible for the judge to rule on the application without first
    hearing the evidence; while the judge could make a temporary ban, the accused
    would have to gamble on whether the ban would be made permanent.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(e)       Requiring
    the accused to justify a publication ban could require preparation on the
    part of the accused and thus delay the bail hearing.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(f)        The
    proceedings would be lengthened with the intervention of third parties such
    as the media and the need to call expert evidence.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(g)       The
    expenditure of time and resources for the many bail hearings that are heard
    each day cannot be justified on a systemic basis.</p>

style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[124]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Having
    laid out these additional objectives, Slatter J.A. held that the temporary
    ban on publication until trial was justified.  He held that the rational
    connection test was met when measured against these other objectives.  In
    doing so, he seems to have concluded that a publication ban could be justified
    even in non-jury cases.  His reasoning is reflected in para. 39, where he
    concluded that Brooker J. erred in holding that preservation of an untainted
    jury is the only objective of s. 517:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[Brooker J.’s]
    analysis also overlooked the other important objectives of s. 517. It precludes
    consideration of any argument that trial judges (even though they are trained
    to ignore such matters) should be insulated from pre-trial publicity when
    possible.</p>

    cannot agree with the Alberta Court of Appeal that an objective of the provision
    could be to insulate trial judges from pre-trial publicity.  Trial judges
    are expected to ignore such matters; our entire system of non-jury trials
    is built on the theory that judges can ignore highly prejudicial and inadmissible
    evidence.  Trial judges are routinely asked to rule on the admissibility
    of confessions, bad character evidence, and constitutionally inadmissible
    evidence.  The system depends on the ability of trial judges to ignore evidence
    deemed inadmissible when reaching the merits of the case.  I am not aware
    of any case that holds that a publication ban can be justified on the basis
    that a trial judge should not be tainted by pre-trial publicity.  Indeed,
    the Alberta Court of Appeal, when considering a publication ban on an appeal
    hearing to revoke White’s bail, characterized the objective of s. 517 as “aimed
    at preserving the presumption of innocence and the right to a fair trial
    by ensuring that prospective jurors have no preconceived notions about guilt
    prior to trial”:  <i>R. v. White</i> (2006), 380 A.R. 188 at para. 29 (<i>White
    #3</i>). While I agree with the Court of Appeal for the reasons set out earlier
    that the rational connection test has been met, in my view, the rational
    connection of s. 517 to the objectives cannot be supported by relying on
    the tainting effect of bail information on non-jury trials.</p>

style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[126]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Court of Appeal also held that the minimal impairment test has been met.  While
    I have reached the same conclusion, I would comment on one part of the analysis.  In
    considering the minimal impairment test, Slatter J.A. dismissed the media’s
    argument that the newsworthiness of bail information depends upon the information
    being immediately available.  At para. 47 he noted that, since the media
    decides what is newsworthy, it can always choose to give prominence to the
    bail proceedings after the trial.  He also observed at para. 49 that the
    most compelling argument from the media was that s. 517 delays debate on “whether,
    why and when” accused should be granted bail in high profile cases.  He dismissed
    this argument because “if the media chose to stimulate a public debate on
    the place of bail in the criminal justice system, they could easily have
    done so after the trial, with little overall effect on the long-term public
    interest because of the delay”.  </p>

    take a somewhat different view of the nature of the freedom of the press.
    Even before the enactment of the <i>Charter</i>, the Supreme Court recognized
    editorial control as an essential attribute of the freedom of the press: <i>Gay
    Alliance v. Vancouver Sun</i>, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 435, at pp.453-55. As Lamer
    J. said in <i>Canadian Newspapers Co. v.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    (Attorney General)</i> at p. 129, measures that prohibit the media from publishing
    information “deemed of interest” restrict freedom of the press. Freedom of
    the press encompasses not just the freedom to decide what to report but also
    the timing of the reporting. If, by the time the trial is finished, what
    transpired at the bail hearing is no longer deemed newsworthy, the Canadian
    public as consumers of the news are the poorer for it. Immediacy is the essence
    of news: <i>Dagenais</i> at p. 929, per Gonthier&nbsp;J. (dissenting).  To
    repeat what Doherty J.A. said in <i>Domm</i> at para. 40, the values promoted
    by s. 2(b) are not served when “the message to be conveyed has lost its purpose”.
    It is not for Parliament or the courts to dictate the timing of debate on
    issues of public importance, but that is exactly the effect of the temporary
    ban in s. 517.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[128]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    to the final stage of the s. 1 analysis, whether the salutary effects of
    the legislation are proportionate to its deleterious effects, Slatter J.A.
    considered that s. 517 struck the necessary balance between the rights to
    a fair trial and reasonable bail and freedom of the press. As he said at
    para. 57,
    “the benefits of the restrictions on publication in s. 517 outweigh the negative
    effects of those restrictions”. I now wish to return to a discussion of the
    objectives identified by the Alberta Court of Appeal.  It seems to me that
    the principal reason that court reached a different conclusion than I have
    on this final factor is because of the broad view the court took of the objectives
    of the mandatory ban.  </p>

    is apparent from my reasons, I agree with several of the objectives identified
    by the Alberta Court of Appeal, particularly those identified as objectives
    (c) and (d).  However, I cannot agree with several of the other objectives.  For
    the reasons expressed earlier, I cannot agree that preventing the tainting
    of a trial judge in a judge-alone trial is a valid objective.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    well, I cannot agree that placing any burden on the accused to justify a
    limitation on publication undermines the presumption of innocence and the
    right to remain silent (objective (a)).  The fact that, for tactical reasons,
    the accused may feel it necessary to adduce evidence at the bail hearing
    does not undermine either the presumption of innocence or the right to remain
    silent.  The Supreme Court of Canada has spoken on this issue, albeit in
    a different context, in <i>R. v. Darrach</i> (2000), 148 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (S.C.C.).
    In that case, the Supreme Court upheld the procedure the accused must follow
    to lay the groundwork for an application to adduce evidence of the complainant’s
    prior sexual conduct under s. 276 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  In that case,
    the court held that requiring an accused to adduce evidence, which may include
    disclosure of his defence to a sexual assault charge, does not infringe the <i>Charter</i>.  Given
    the decision in <i>Darrach</i>, I fail to see how the accused’s rights are
    infringed by the need to demonstrate why there should be a publication ban.  An
    accused seeking a publication ban under s. 517 is not forced to testify,
    nor is the accused coerced by the state.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[131]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Alberta Court of Appeal held that it was inappropriate to expect an accused
    to rebut evidence of character, lifestyle and associates prior to his trial.  That
    may be so, but I fail to see why this justifies a mandatory publication ban.  In <i>Hollinger
    Inc. v. Ravelston Corp.</i> (2008), 89 O.R. (3d) 721 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), leave to appeal refused, [2008] S.C.C.A. No. 260, Juriansz J.A., dissenting
    in part, noted at para.&nbsp;97 that the open court principle would be slender
    if it did not apply to documents that had not been tested as to their factual
    probity. Similarly, the open court principle and the right to freedom of
    expression would be weak if the media could only report on information after
    it had been fully tested and contested at a full trial.  As well, the mandatory
    ban on bail hearing proceedings does not prevent the publication of untested
    and unfiltered material that comes into the hands of the media from other
    sources, such as the pre-bail hearing police press conference.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[132]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Alberta Court of Appeal also considered that it was unfair to expect the
    accused, who is frequently unrepresented at the bail hearing, to defend his
    entitlement to bail on fair terms against the interests of the media (objective
    (b)). In my view, seeking a discretionary ban does not implicate the accused’s
    entitlement to bail.  The media is not a party to the bail hearing and has
    no say in the accused’s entitlement to bail.  The accused’s only opponent
    on the issue of bail is the prosecution.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    the Alberta Court of Appeal was of the view that the expenditure of time
    and resources that would be required when adjudicating applications for discretionary
    bans cannot be justified on a systemic basis (objective (g)).  The court,
    however, did not refer to any evidence that would support this proposition.  It
    would seem to me that, since the court is required to consider the actual
    deleterious and salutary effects, speculation about resources is not sufficient.</p>

    52 of the <i>Constitution Act, 1982</i> provides that any law that is inconsistent
    with the <i>Constitution</i> is, to the extent of the inconsistency, “of
    no force and effect”.  In the circumstances of this case, since it is possible
    to define with precision the inconsistent part of the provision, the appropriate
    remedy would seem to be severance by removing the words “and shall on application
    by the accused” that create the mandatory publication ban in s. 517.  This
    would leave in place the discretionary ban.  In deciding whether to exercise
    that discretion the justice or judge would be guided by the <i>Dagenais</i> directives:
    see <i>Canadian Broadcasting Corp. </i>at paras. 68-76.  </p>

    only other remedy would be to strike down the whole of s. 517.  In choosing
    between these two remedies, the principle considerations appear to be those
    set out by Sopinka J. in <i>Osborne v. Canada (Treasury Board)</i>, [1991]
    2 S.C.R. 69, at p. 104, being the need to fashion a remedy to “apply the
    measures which will best vindicate the values expressed in the <i>Charter</i>” and “refrain
    from intruding into the legislative sphere beyond what is necessary”: see <i>Schachter
    v. Canada</i>, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 679, at p. 707. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view severance or reading down is the appropriate remedy.  This is not
    a case like <i>R. v. Seaboyer </i>(1991), 66 C.C.C. (3d) 321 (S.C.C.) where
    the court rejected reading down the impugned provision to provide for discretion
    because Parliament had specifically chosen to exclude that element.  Section
    517 has always contained a discretionary element and the mandatory ban would
    in effect restore the provision to its original form when the <i>Bail Reform
    Act</i> was enacted.  I do not therefore see severance as a substantial change
    to the law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[138]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    Lamer C.J. pointed out in <i>Schachter</i> at p. 711, another way of testing
    the appropriateness of the remedy is to look at the effect on the remaining
    portion.  As he said: “The problem with striking down only the inconsistent
    portion is that the significance of the remaining portion changes so markedly
    without the inconsistent portion that the assumption that the legislature
    would have enacted it is unsafe.”  In my view, that cannot be said in this
    case. </p>

style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[139]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> I
    am strengthened in this view when the issue is looked at from the point of
    view of the “significance or long-standing nature of the remaining portion”:  <i>Schachter</i> at
    p. 712.  As Lamer C.J. said at p. 713 of <i>Schachter</i>: “If the remaining
    portion is very significant, or of a long standing nature, it strengthens
    the assumption that it would have been enacted without the impermissible
    portion.” Given the fact that the provision as originally enacted was solely
    a discretionary ban, I am satisfied that severance is preferable to striking
    down the entire provision and is the remedy that least interferes with the
    intention of Parliament.</p>

    suspended<i>.</i>  In <i>Schachter</i> at p.&nbsp;719, Lamer C.J. explained
    the circumstances in which it is appropriate to temporarily suspend the declaration
    of invalidity:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Temporarily
    suspending the declaration of invalidity to give Parliament or the provincial
    legislature in question an opportunity to bring the impugned legislation
    or legislative provision into line with its constitutional obligations will
    be warranted even where striking down has been deemed the most appropriate
    option on the basis of one of the above criteria if:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    C.J. went on to point out that these propositions were intended only as guidelines.
    As Brooker J. noted in <i>White </i># 2 at para. 124, since <i>Schachter</i> the
    Supreme Court has suspended the declaration of invalidity in freedom of expression
    cases not falling within these guidelines where the legislation was overbroad.  </p>

    J. found that criterion B was met. He wrote at para. 118, as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In my view,
    to remove the mandatory portion of s. 517 would offend the Rule of Law and
    result in a legislative gap. This is because, in light of the current notice
    requirements to the media and restrictions on bail hearing adjournments,
    such a severance without replacement legislation would have the effect of
    potentially denying accused persons their constitutional right not to be
    arbitrarily detained under s. 9 of the <i>Charter</i>, which forms part of
    the fundamental law of this country.</p>

    am not convinced that the impact of removing the mandatory ban would be profound
    given that the deleterious effects outweigh the salutary effects.  Further,
    as I have indicated, it is my view that it is not necessary for the bail

    I am concerned that removing the mandatory ban and leaving in place only
    the discretionary ban in s. 517 may not be sufficient to meet other objectives
    that are currently served by the mandatory ban.  I return to the wording
    of s. 517, having removed the words which allow for the mandatory ban:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>If the prosecutor
    or the accused intends to show cause under section 515, he or she shall so
    state to the justice and the justice may, before or at any time during the

    principal concern is that, as worded, the discretionary ban that can be imposed
    under s. 517 applies to all information relating to the proceedings.  Put
    another way, a justice of the peace might not have the jurisdiction under
    s. 517 to impose a carefully tailored ban. For instance, a limited prohibition
    on the publication of the accused’s confession might be the only type of
    ban which passes constitutional muster, yet the justice of the peace might
    not be able to impose such a ban.</p>

    may be that a justice of the peace has jurisdiction at common law to make
    a carefully tailored order, but the jurisdiction of a statutory court to
    resort to the common law in the face of an express statutory provision is
    unclear: see the full discussion of the jurisdiction of courts of record
    to impose publication bans in <i>Re Church of Scientology of Toronto et al.
    and the Queen (No. 6)</i> (1986), 27 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (Ont. H.C.J.).  In other
    words, I am concerned that striking out the mandatory ban may leave a gap
    because a justice of the peace would not have the jurisdiction either under
    the revised s. 517 or at common law to make the kind of order that is necessary
    and would meet constitutional standards.</p>

    justice of the peace might be persuaded that there was justification for
    a publication ban at common law or under statute in accordance with these
    tests, but only in respect of certain information.  For example, an accused
    might be able to show through submissions that he or she will be denied the
    right to reasonable bail because sureties will refuse to come forward if
    the proceedings are published.  The justice of the peace might be satisfied
    that the <i>Dagenais/Mentuck </i>test can only be met through a narrowly
    tailored ban, for example, a ban on publication of the identity of the sureties.  Similarly,
    where the prosecution intends to adduce the fact that the accused confessed,
    the justice of the peace might be convinced the <i>Dagenais/Mentuck</i> test
    had been met, but only in respect of publication of the confession and not

    wish to consider whether it is necessary to amend s. 517 so that a justice

    the same time, it is unclear whether a justice of the peace acting under
    Part XVI of the <i>Criminal Code</i> has jurisdiction to make a common law
    publication ban.  While the courts have recognized that trial judges and
    superior courts have jurisdiction to impose publication bans, it is not apparent
    that a justice of the peace or judge of the Ontario Court of Justice conducting
    a bail hearing has that jurisdiction.  In <i>Dagenais</i>, at p. 857, Lamer
    C.J. wrote as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>To seek a ban
    under a judge's common law or legislated discretionary authority, the Crown
    and/or the accused should ask for a ban pursuant to that authority. <i>This
    request should be made to the trial judge (if one has been appointed) or
    to a judge in the court at the level the case will be heard</i> (if the level
    of court can be established definitively by reference to statutory provisions
    such as ss. 468, 469, 553, 555, 798 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C.,
    1985, c. C-46, and s. 5 of the <i>Young Offenders Act,</i> R.S.C., 1985,
    c. Y-1). <i>If the level of court has not been established and cannot be
    established definitively by reference to statutory provisions, then the request
    should be made to a superior court judge</i> (i.e., it should be made to
    the highest court that could hear the case, in order to avoid later having
    a superior court judge bound by an order made by a provincial court judge).  [Emphasis
    added.]</p>

    would be highly impractical to require an accused to apply to the Superior
    Court of Justice for a publication ban; the jurisdiction to make such an
    order should reside in the court conducting the show cause hearing.  I should
    not be taken as having decided the issue of whether a justice of the peace
    or judge conducting a show cause hearing has the necessary common law jurisdiction.  However,
    given the uncertainty surrounding the issue and the possibility of a gap

    Rosenberg J.A., where he concludes that the mandatory publication ban of
    bail proceedings when requested by an accused, contained in s. 517 of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, violates s. 2(b) of the <i>Charter</i>, freedom
    of the press, and is not saved by s. 1. He finds that the provision meets
    the pressing and substantial objective, the rational connection and the minimal
    impairment criteria under <i>Oakes</i>, and bases his conclusion only on
    the third branch of the proportionality test, that in seeking to protect
    the accused’s fair trial rights, the salutary effects of the mandatory ban
    do not outweigh its deleterious effects. He would strike down the mandatory
    publication ban, but suspend the order for 12 months to allow Parliament
    to devise and provide a scheme whereby judges and justices of the peace would
    have the discretion to impose limited bans in particular cases.</p>

    the mandatory publication ban, as currently drafted, violates s. 2(b) of
    the <i>Charter</i>, and is not saved by s. 1. However, in my view, this is
    because it is overly broad in its scope, applying to bail hearings for all
    charges, including those that cannot be tried by a jury; the provision, therefore,
    to that extent, does not meet the rational connection or the minimal impairment
    tests under <i>Oakes</i>. </p>

    ban is needed in jury cases to protect an accused’s right to a fair trial
    under s. 11(d) and s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i>, by preventing potential jurors
    from learning of prejudicial information from bail hearings which may never
    be heard at trial. In my view, because it is also critically important that
    the rights of an accused under s. 11(e) and s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i> to
    reasonable bail following an expeditious bail hearing be protected in possible
    jury cases, the publication ban must be mandatory at the request of an accused
    and not merely available at the discretion of the justice following a hearing
    on that issue. I would therefore leave the mandatory ban in place, but read
    down the legislation to make it applicable only to show cause hearings in
    respect of charges that procedurally may possibly be tried by a jury.</p>

    has dealt with a number of preliminary issues raised on this appeal including:
    1) that this appeal should be heard regardless of whether it is moot, 2)
    that the court will consider the fresh evidence tendered by the Attorney
    General of Ontario, 3) that the trial judge was correct in his interpretation
    of s. 517 that the mandatory publication ban applies to all jointly charged
    accused when one accused asks for it, and 4) that it is appropriate for this
    court to reconsider its 1984 decision in <i>Re Global Communications Ltd.
    and Attorney General for Canada </i>(1984), 44 O.R. (2d) 609, where the court
    upheld the constitutional validity of the mandatory publication ban under
    s. 517. I agree with his analysis and his disposition of these issues.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The <i>Charter </i>Issues</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[162]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is accepted
    that the s. 517 mandatory publication ban on bail hearings at the request
    of an accused violates s. 2(b) of the <i>Charter</i>. The issue before this
    court is whether and to what extent it is saved under s. 1. I am in full
    agreement with much of my colleague’s analysis. I agree with his conclusion
    that the legislation has a pressing and substantial objective. In my view,
    as currently worded, the legislation does not pass the rational connection
    and minimal impairment stages of the <i>Oakes</i> test insofar as it mandates
    a bail hearing publication ban where a future jury trial is not possible.
    In all other respects, I agree that the provision meets both the rational
    connection and the minimal impairment requirements of the <i>Oakes</i> test.
    Finally, once the mandatory ban is limited to situations where a future jury
    trial is possible, I do not agree with Rosenberg J.A. that the legislation
    fails the third part of the proportionality test comparing salutary and deleterious
    effects.  In my view, the salutary effects of the mandatory publication ban
    outweigh its deleterious effects, and the provision is saved under s. 1 of
    the <i>Charter</i>.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As Rosenberg
    J.A. states, the parties appear to disagree on the objective of the legislation.
    However, that apparent disagreement stems from the fact that the parties
    are not separately addressing the two components of the legislation: 1) the
    publication ban itself, and 2) the fact that it is mandatory when requested
    by the accused. Each of these components has its own objective. In my view,
    in order to conduct an effective s. 1 analysis, the two components of the
    legislation should be addressed separately at each stage. For ease of reference,
    s. 517 reads:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;line-height:normal;
'><span style='color:black;'>(1)  If the prosecutor or the accused intends to
      show cause under section 515, he or she shall so state to the justice and
      the justice may, and shall on application by the accused, before or at
      any time during the course of the proceedings under that section, make
      an order directing that the evidence taken, the information given or the
      representations made and the reasons, if any, given or to be given by the
      justice shall not be published in any document, or broadcast or transmitted
      in any way before such time as</span></p>

  <p align=left style='

    is tried or ordered to stand trial, the trial is ended.</p>

style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[164]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The purpose of
    imposing a publication ban on bail proceedings is to protect the accused’s
    right to a fair trial by an impartial jury, a right guaranteed by ss. 7 and
    11(d) of the <i>Charter.</i> The accused’s right to an impartial jury, and
    therefore to a fair trial, may be undermined if members of the jury have
    heard or read about details from the bail proceedings that may not be heard
    at the trial. Section 518 of the <i>Code</i> gives broad latitude for the
    introduction of evidence at the bail hearing that either may not be admissible
    at the trial or may be presumptively inadmissible at the trial, including
    wiretaps, the accused’s complete criminal record, other pending charges,
    confessions and statements by the accused and hearsay that the justice considers
    credible or trustworthy.</p>

    by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Dagenais v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp.</i>,
    [1994] 3 S.C.R. 835, at pp. 884-886. The extent of the vulnerability of juries
    to tainting is clearly a matter of ongoing debate both in the courts and
    in social science empirical research and analysis. For example, up until
    this court’s decision in <i>R. v.</i> <i>Parks</i> (1993), 84 C.C.C. (3d)
    353, leave to appeal refused, (1993), 87 C.C.C. (3d) vi (S.C.C.), although
    there was some social science evidence to the contrary, it was accepted by
    our courts that white jurors could be trusted to put aside any racial prejudice
    they may have harboured against a black accused in order to carry out their
    duties as impartial arbiters in accordance with the instructions of the trial
    judge. Unfortunately, once the challenge for cause was extended to the issue
    of racial prejudice following <i>Parks</i>, it became apparent that a number
    of jurors were not able to set aside their prejudice and decide the case
    only according to the evidence and the instructions of the trial judge. </p>

    of whether and to what extent juries may be affected by or act on information

    ban on bail proceedings could be undertaken under the rational connection

    conclusion that the salutary effects of the ban are weak and speculative,

      Justice Trotter identifies some recent social science writing which suggests
      that juries are in fact more influenced by information they glean outside
      the trial than was previously believed. At this point, we have no definitive
      evidence of the extent to which juries’ verdicts may be affected by such
      information. What we do have are common law rules developed by the courts
      to address the issue and to try to ensure, to the extent possible, that

    from juries include involuntary confessions or confessions made in breach

    is admitted in most cases with a specific instruction to the jury as to its
    use and misuse and with an explanation for the limitations. Examples include
    the evidence of an accomplice or jail house informant where a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning
    (<i>Vetrovec v. The Queen</i> (1982), 67 C.C.C. (2d) 1 (S.C.C.)) explains
    to the jury why such a witness may have a reason to lie, similar fact evidence
    that meets the <i>Handy</i> test and is allowed to be heard and properly
    considered by the jury in relation to specific issues, prior inconsistent
    statements that are not adopted by the witness, and after- the- fact conduct.
    As well, the jury is always told by the presiding judge that the questions
    and submissions of counsel that they hear in court are not evidence and cannot
    be taken as evidence unless they are adopted by a witness or a document that
    is in evidence.<i></i></p>

    directed by the trial judge to base their decision only on the evidence presented
    in court and to put out of their minds anything they have heard, seen or
    read about the case outside the courtroom. However, that general instruction
    is not the equivalent of completely excluding prejudicial evidence, or of

    the common law and <i>Charter</i> rules for the exclusion of certain evidence
    and the importance of limiting instructions by trial judges, the Supreme
    Court of Canada has repeatedly emphasized its trust in juries to follow the
    instructions of the trial judge. The strength of our jury system depends
    on the ability and the willingness of jurors not only to apply their common
    sense when considering the evidence, but also to take the law from the judge
    and to act in accordance with the judge’s directions regarding their duties
    and obligations. In cases such as <i>Corbett </i>and <i>Dagenais</i>, the
    Supreme Court has struggled with how to give full effect to that trust while
    at the same time ensuring that an accused person will have a fair trial by
    an impartial jury. <i></i></p>

style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[172]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Corbett</i>,
    for example, Dickson C.J., for the majority, considered s. 12 of the <i>Canada
    Evidence Act</i>, R.S.C. 1970, c. E-10, which allows a witness, including
    an accused, to be cross-examined on his or her criminal record. He concluded
    that the provision did not violate the presumption of innocence in s. 11(d)
    of the <i>Charter</i> because the jury is instructed that it can only use
    the record for the issue of credibility and not as proof of guilt. He noted
    that other safeguards, such as the prohibition on cross-examination of the
    accused on the underlying circumstances of the convictions, assist the jury
    in understanding that the only reason they are hearing about the record is
    to give them a full picture of the accused person’s credibility. Finally,
    Dickson C.J. found that in order to ensure the accused’s fair trial rights,
    the trial judge retains the discretion under s. 12 to, in effect, “edit” the
    accused’s criminal record where any probative value regarding the accused’s
    credibility would be outweighed by the prejudicial effect of a prior conviction,
    particularly for  a similar offence. He stated at p. 404:<i></i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>These limitations
    on the use of prior convictions, together with the discretion recognized
    by the reasons of La&nbsp;Forest&nbsp;J., demonstrate a marked solicitude
    for the right of the accused to a fair trial and indicate that the law relating
    to the use of prior convictions strives to avoid the risk of preju­dicing
    an accused's trial by introduction of evidence of prior misdeeds. Taken as
    a whole, this body of law is entirely protective of the right of the accused
    not to be convicted except on evidence directly relevant to the charge in
    question. Within this context, it cannot be said that s. 12 of the <i>Canada
    Evidence Act</i> operates in such a way as to deprive the accused of the
    right to a fair trial.</p>

    Lamer C.J. also expressed his trust in the ability of jurors to follow the
    instructions of the trial judge even in cases where they will have been exposed
    to pre-trial publicity. However, the thrust of his reasons still focused
    on ways other than a publication ban for the court to address the fair trial
    concern created by the undeniable potential for the jury to be affected by
    pre-trial publicity. He stated at p. 887:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[A]lthough it
    is possible that a publication ban will have a <i>total</i> absence of influence
    on the fairness of the trial, such cases will be rare. As a result, one will
    generally have to go further and consider the availability of reasonable
    alternative measures when assessing whether, in a given case, a publication
    ban was necessary. [Emphasis in original.] </p>

    concluded that the fair trial objective of the s. 517 publication ban is
    pressing and substantial and that the measure is rationally connected to
    its purpose, to protect the fair trial rights of an accused against possible
    jury contamination. I agree with his conclusion. However, later in his proportionality
    analysis, his conclusion that the salutary effects of the mandatory ban are
    outweighed by its deleterious effects is based in large part on his concern
    that the causal connection between pre-trial publicity and jury contamination
    is weak and speculative and his acceptance that jury members would not remember
    most if not all of such publicity by the time of the trial. I do not share
    that concern nor do I accept that view.</p>

    I have outlined above, I conclude that the potential for jurors to be affected
    by prejudicial information they have heard outside the trial has been accepted
    by the courts as something that must be guarded against in order to protect
    both the accused’s right to a fair trial and the public’s right to be confident
    that justice is done. Clearly some jurors will be able to follow their oaths
    and disabuse themselves of prior information they may have learned about
    the accused or the case. Our faith in juries is based on their willingness
    to do so. However, some jurors may not be able to do so, or may not realize
    that they have been influenced or affected by pre-trial publicity. Further,
    in some instances, depending on the nature of the prejudicial information,
    it may be impossible for even the most conscientious jurors to disabuse themselves
    of that information. Sometimes, in order to prevent prejudice to the accused,
    the proper remedy is the declaration of a mistrial: see <i>R. v. Burke</i> (2002),
    164 C.C.C. (3d) 385 (S.C.C.), at para. 74, where Major J. stated that one
    circumstance where a mistrial may be declared to prevent a miscarriage of
    justice is “where inadmissible evidence is adduced during trial which might
    influence a jury.” </p>

    see <i>RJR-MacDonald Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General), </i>[1995] 3 S.C.R.
    199, at para. 153. As I believe it is necessary to break down the legislative

    of the ban itself, preserving the fair trial rights of the accused.</p>

    is mandatory at the request of the accused, s. 517 creates “an expeditious
    and effective means” of obtaining the order (see Rosenberg J.A.’s reasons
    at para. 50). Because the ban is mandatory and not discretionary, it guarantees
    that: (1) the accused’s fair trial interest will not be violated, (2) the
    accused will not suffer delay in obtaining bail, i.e., his or her liberty,
    (3) the accused will not have his or her financial and other resources diverted
    from the bail and trial preparation processes to fight against the media
    for a publication ban. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If the publication
    ban issue were discretionary, whether the media were present or not, in every
    bail proceeding where a publication ban was requested the justice would be
    required to consider the propriety of making the order. The appellants argued,
    and Rosenberg J.A. accepted, that a justice would have to conduct a <i>Dagenais</i> analysis
    in each case in order to determine whether to order a ban in the particular
    case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[190]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There are several
    problems with attempting to apply the <i>Dagenais</i> test in the bail hearing
    context when an accused is seeking to protect his or her fair trial rights.
    To begin, <i>Dagenais </i>involved a request for a publication ban based
    on common law principles in order to prevent the airing of a television show
    that dramatized very unsavoury events relating to cases that were being heard
    or were about to be heard before juries. Lamer C.J. emphasized that the principles
    discussed applied to a common law, not a statutory, publication ban order.
    The context was an extraordinary set of circumstances that arose close to
    the trial, not an everyday procedure that occurs at the very beginning of
    the criminal process before the accused has been given disclosure or the
    time to evaluate the case with counsel and to make important and informed
    decisions about procedural and substantive issues. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[191]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Lamer C.J. held
    that the application must go before a superior court judge who has the discretion
    to tailor an order to meet the circumstances of the case. Importantly, Lamer
    C.J. held that the judge should turn first to alternative methods of preventing
    the jury from being affected by adverse pre-trial publicity, alternative
    methods such as a change of venue, adjournment of the trial, sequestering
    jurors, challenge for cause or strong judicial direction to the jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[192]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is apparent
    that the <i>Dagenais</i> process does not transfer easily and effectively
    to the ordinary bail proceeding and that Lamer C.J. did not intend the process
    he described to be applied by a justice of the peace on a regular basis in
    an everyday hearing that is intended to be expeditious.<a href="#_ftn10"

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New \(W1\)&quot;;
'>[10]</span></span></span></a> As Lamer C.J. noted at p. 891, the <i>Dagenais </i>hearing
    involves a complex constitutional weighing where the accused who is seeking
    bail would have:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>the burden of
    proving that the proposed ban is necessary, in that it relates to an important
    objective that cannot be achieved by a reasonably available and effective
    alternative measure, that the proposed ban is as limited (in scope, time,
    content, etc.) as possible, and there is a proportionality between the salutary
    and deleterious effects of the ban. At the same time, the fact that the party
    seeking the ban may be attempting to safeguard a constitutional right must
    be borne in mind when determining whether the proportionality test has been
    satisfied. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[193]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Even if an accused
    were able to meet this heavy legal burden, it is clearly unrealistic to expect
    that accused persons in the position I have described could do so within
    any form of expeditious time frame.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[194]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Further, the
    presiding judicial officer is required to first consider all other options,
    then all ways to limit the ban, if it is going to be ordered, and must weigh
    “the importance of the objectives of the particular ban and its probable
    effects against the importance of the particular expression that will be
    limited to ensure that the positive and negative effects of the ban are proportionate.” (p.891). </p>

line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[195]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If it is accepted,
    as Rosenberg J.A. did, that the mandatory ban does not pass constitutional
    muster because the concern for fair trial rights based on jury tainting is
    generally a speculative concern, I find it difficult to imagine in what circumstances
    a discretionary ban on bail proceedings would ever be ordered to protect
    an accused’s fair trial rights.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[196]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Nor can a justice
    of the peace make any order that affects the trial, such as an adjournment
    or change of venue order. These types of alternatives are available to a
    superior court judge who deals with the issue of prejudice just before trial,
    but not to a justice on a bail hearing. Rosenberg J.A. has also raised doubts
    whether a justice of the peace currently has the authority to tailor or limit
    a ban. The result is that, while the <i>Dagenais</i> analysis would require
    the justice to consider alternative measures to protect the fair trial rights
    of the accused, the justice would have no control or formal input into whether
    any such alternatives are actually implemented. This also creates further
    uncertainty for the accused when making the decision whether to seek bail. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Along with the
    issues regarding the suitability of the <i>Dagenais</i> procedure and test
    to the bail hearing process, the amount of time needed to conduct a discretionary
    publication ban hearing in every case where an accused asks for a discretionary
    ban would further overburden an already overburdened bail system.  Whether
    opposed or unopposed, the motion for the ban would add to the length of the
    bail hearing. At least initially, criminal duty counsel may feel unprepared
    to properly conduct a publication ban request proceeding according to the <i>Dagenais</i> criteria
    and likely will require extra time to prepare. There will be a need for adjournments
    and hearings will be longer. </p>

    current problem with overburdened bail courts was recently highlighted by
    the decision of De Filippis J. in <i>R. v. Jevons</i> [2008] O.J. No. 4397
    (Ont. C.J.), where he stayed criminal charges on the date fixed for trial
    because of the delay in the accused’s bail proceeding. In his reasons, De
    Filippis J. gave a detailed account of the accused’s 8-day ordeal waiting
    for a court to have the time to hear his bail application. In his affidavit
    on the stay motion, the accused testified that when the Crown finally agreed
    to consent to bail, he was
    “prepared to agree to just about anything to secure…release” and he had
    “serious doubts” that he would ever obtain a bail hearing (para. 13).  </p>

style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[199]<span

    also described the backlog plaguing the bail courts in the
    <st1:place

    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Durham region and the fact that, for the week in question, the court was
    unable to deal with the majority of contested bail applications and only
    had time for consent bails and adjournments. De Filippis J. concluded that
    the accused was the victim of systemic delay in the bail system in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Durham region and that his <i>Charter</i> right to reasonable bail under

style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[200]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In summary, in
    order to be of practical value to an accused seeking to protect his or her
    fair trial right through a publication ban on the bail proceedings, the ban
    must be mandatory and not discretionary. The existing procedure for seeking
    a discretionary ban under <i>Dagenais</i> puts a heavy and difficult onus
    on the accused and, if implemented following Rosenberg J.A.’s analysis, appears
    to have little likelihood of success. In fact, counsel for the appellants
    acknowledged that very few discretionary bans would likely be granted and
    eventually accused persons seeking bail would not ask for publication bans,
    thereby solving any delay and cost problems associated with seeking the discretionary
    order.</p>

line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[201]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The consequence
    could be that accused persons could be forced to choose between compromising
    their fair trial rights by proceeding with their bail application without
    a publication ban, or foregoing the right to seek bail in order to ensure
    that prejudicial information disclosed in the course of the bail hearing

    concluded that s. 517 meets the minimal impairment test. I agree to the extent
    that it applies to matters that may be tried by a jury. As with the rational
    connection criterion, because the publication ban applies to bail hearings
    in respect of all charges and not just charges that have the potential to
    be heard by a jury, s. 517 cannot be said to minimally impair the infringement
    of s. 2(b) of the <i>Charter</i>. The Attorney General for
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario has suggested that the law is reasonably tailored, despite its application
    where a jury trial is not possible, because it protects the accused on occasions
    when an accused is initially charged with a summary conviction offence and
    is later charged with more serious offences that could potentially be tried
    by a jury. However, if on any of these occasional circumstances there has
    been reporting of prejudicial information from the summary conviction bail
    hearing, and the accused has concerns regarding the ability to obtain a fair
    trial before a jury on the later, more serious charges as a result, steps
    can be taken before trial to curtail the prejudice, such as, for example,
    challenge for cause or change of venue.</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The impairment
    must be “minimal”, that is, the law must be carefully tailored so that rights
    are impaired no more than necessary. The tailoring process seldom admits
    of perfection and the courts must accord some leeway to the legislator. If
    the law falls within a range of reasonable alternatives, the courts will
    not find it overbroad merely because they can conceive of an alternative
    which might better tailor objective to infringement…On the other hand, if
    the government fails to explain why a significantly less intrusive and equally
    effective measure was not chosen, the law may fail.</p>

style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[207]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>One of the alternative
    measures that Rosenberg J.A. considers and initially rejects at the minimal
    impairment stage of his analysis, is a discretionary, tailored ban limited
    to specific types of prejudicial information that would be inadmissible at
    trial, such as an involuntary confession, bad character evidence, similar
    fact evidence or an accused’s full criminal record. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[208]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Another alternative
    that should also be considered is a mandatory ban that is limited to a specified
    list of such evidence or information. Such a ban has all the benefits of
    being mandatory: no delay of the bail hearing, no uncertainty for the accused
    that may cause the accused to have to choose between bail and the right to
    a fair trial, no extra time demands on the bail proceeding, no difficulties
    for the accused in preparing for and conducting a hearing to meet the <i>Dagenais </i>test.
    By being limited to information that is clearly prejudicial and possibly
    inadmissible at the trial, such a ban would, in theory, have a much more
    limited effect on freedom of the press by allowing the reporting of some
    information from the bail hearing, including all or some of the reasons for
    granting or denying bail.</p>

    ban that is limited to specific types of evidence would not be
    “equally effective,” to use the language of <i>RJR MacDonald</i> at para.
    160. One problem is that it could be very difficult for Parliament to draft
    a sufficiently comprehensive list of banned prejudicial information. More
    importantly, as a practical matter, the press may find it unworkable to be
    circumscribed in what it is able to report from the bail hearing, especially
    if it is the banned, prejudicial evidence that is critical to the decision
    of the justice. </p>

    <i> (Attorney-General) v. JTI Macdonald Corp.</i>, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 610, at
    para. 43, McLachlin C.J., writing for the court, emphasized the importance
    of deference by the courts where Parliament seeks to address multifaceted
    problems:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Again, a certain measure of deference may be appropriate,
    where the problem Parliament is tackling is a complex social problem.&nbsp; There
    may be many ways to approach a particular problem, and no certainty as to
    which will be the most effective.&nbsp; It may, in the calm of the courtroom,
    be possible to imagine a solution that impairs the right at stake less than
    the solution Parliament has adopted.&nbsp; But one must also ask whether
    the alternative would be reasonably effective when weighed against the means
    chosen by Parliament.&nbsp; To complicate matters, a particular legislative
    regime may have a number of goals, and impairing a right minimally in the
    furtherance of one particular goal may inhibit achieving another goal.&nbsp; Crafting
    legislative solutions to complex problems is necessarily a complex task.&nbsp; It
    is a task that requires weighing and balancing.&nbsp;
    For this reason, this Court has held that on complex social issues, the minimal
    impairment requirement is met if Parliament has chosen one of several reasonable
    alternatives: <i>R. v. Edwards Books and Art Ltd.</i>, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 713; <i>Irwin
    Toy</i>.</p>

    the legislative approach chosen by Parliament represents a reasonable alternative
    which effectively protects an accused’s fair trial rights. It is the role
    of the court to respect Parliament’s choice unless it does not pass constitutional
    muster. </p>

    found that the legislation fails at this stage of the s. 1 analysis because
    in his view, the deleterious effects of the legislation outweigh its salutary
    effects. He found that the deleterious effects are substantial while the
    salutary effects are speculative and limited. It is at this stage of the
    analysis where we have our major disagreement.</p>

line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[213]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The requirements
    of the third branch of the <i>Oakes</i> proportionality test were articulated
    by Lamer C.J. in <i>Dagenais, </i>where the context was an in-depth consideration
    of the constitutional parameters to be considered when a court is asked to
    order a publication ban at common law.  There must be proportionality between
    the objective of a measure and its deleterious effects, and also between
    the actual salutary effects of the measure and its deleterious effects. Lamer
    C.J. explained how this proportionality analysis applies when deciding whether
    to order a common law publication ban at pp. 889-90:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>A similar view
    of proportionality must inform the common law rule governing publication
    bans…This suggests that when a ban has a serious deleterious effect on freedom
    of expression and has few salutary effects on the fairness of a trial, the
    ban will not be authorized at common law.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>It is also important
    to recognize, however, that the objective usually underlying such bans -
    the diminution of the risk that a trial might be tainted by unfairness –
    is directly related to the accused’s constitutionally protected right to
    a fair trial. Although, as I noted earlier [citation omitted], it is incorrect
    to oversimplify the relationship between the right to a fair trial and the
    right to freedom of expression by blindly applying the “clash of rights” model,
    there are times when the rights of the accused will be in direct conflict
    with the expressive rights of the media. In such cases, I believe it is necessary
    to apply the common law proportionality analysis in a manner that reflects
    the fact that two fundamental rights are in jeopardy. That is, it is essential
    in these circumstances to recognize that the pressing and substantial objective
    at issue is <i>itself</i> a fundamental right, and that, as such, it is a
    matter of exceptional importance. This will be of particular significance
    when considering whether there are reasonable alternative measures available,
    and when assessing the balance between the salutary and deleterious effects
    of the ban. When examining alternative measures, it will be important to
    carefully consider both rights at issue, so as to ensure that any alternative
    measures that impair free expression to a lesser degree than a publication
    ban also reasonably protect the right to a fair trial. Similarly, when considering
    the proportionality of the impact of the ban on free expression to its salutary
    effects on the fairness of the trial, it will be necessary to bear in mind
    the fundamental importance of trial fairness, both to the accused and to
    society. [Emphasis in original.] </p>

    Lamer C.J. rejected the notion that juries are always influenced by publications,
    but recognized as a matter of common sense that some jurors will be adversely
    affected by what they read, see or hear. He expressed confidence that jurors
    can follow judicial instructions to ignore pre-trial information, but also
    expressed concern that this will be more difficult when the publicity is
    not from a finite source but sustained over time. Such sustained pre-trial
    publicity could become implanted into the minds of jurors to the extent that
    they become unable to distinguish the pre-trial information from the evidence
    at trial. </p>

    Lamer C.J. conceded that it will be a rare case when a publication ban will
    have no influence on the fairness of the trial. Therefore he did not discount
    the potential for juror contamination and for trial unfairness because of
    prejudicial pre-trial publicity. Instead, he concluded that when considering
    an accused’s request for a common law publication ban on pre-trial publicity
    about the case, a court should assess whether there are alternative measures
    to accomplish the same purpose. </p>

    lists seven deleterious effects of the mandatory ban. Two relate directly
    to the ban itself: 1) the timing of the ban stifles discussion about the
    bail hearing and the reasons why bail was granted or denied both at the time
    of the decision, or, later if, for example, bail is granted and later revoked.
    Although the ban is temporary, the issue will not be as newsworthy after

    publicity.</p>

style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[218]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The other five
    deleterious effects relate to the fact that the ban is mandatory. The first
    is that the ban extends to charges which can only be tried by a judge alone.
    I have already stated that the mandatory ban is overly-broad in this regard
    and cannot be justified under s. 1. In the remedy I will propose, both the
    Crown and the accused may still seek a discretionary ban in non-jury cases,
    on grounds other than trial fairness based on the potential for jury contamination. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[219]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The other four
    deleterious effects identified by Rosenberg J.A. are: 1) the ban extends
    to all information including non-prejudicial information, and to information
    whose potential prejudice could be addressed by alternative measures such
    as challenge for cause, change of venue and strong judicial direction; 2)
    the ban prohibits publication of the reasons of the justice for granting
    or denying bail, even when the reasons do not interfere with the accused’s
    fair trial rights; 3) the ban operates where prejudicial information is already
    in the public realm, as in these cases where police spoke to the media at
    the time they arrested the accused; and, 4) the ban will prevent individuals
    with knowledge of the case from hearing about it and coming forward with
    relevant information in a timely way.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[220]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although I have
    identified these effects as arising from the fact the ban is mandatory, it
    would be more accurate to say that they arise from the fact that it is a
    mandatory <i>complete</i> ban on all information. As I discussed in the minimal
    impairment section, the ban could have been enacted as a mandatory ban only
    applicable to a list of categories of prejudicial information such as confessions,
    in which case some or even all of these deleterious effects would not occur.
    However, Parliament chose to impose a general ban. The issue at this stage
    of the analysis is whether that choice causes the legislation to fail the <i>Oakes</i> test
    if these deleterious effects are not outweighed by the salutary effect of
    a full mandatory ban.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[221]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Before moving
    to the salutary effects of the mandatory ban, I wish to comment on a number
    of the issues raised by Rosenberg J.A. in his discussion of deleterious effects.
    The first is the notion that alternative measures such as challenge for cause,
    change of venue or strong jury instructions could eliminate the risk to a
    fair trial from publication of prejudicial information from the bail hearing.
    There are two serious practical problems with this suggestion. First, as
    I discussed earlier, these alternative orders are not available to a justice
    on a bail hearing. As well, it would be impractical and costly for accused
    persons, the legal aid system, and the justice system to change the venues
    of jury trials on a regular basis as a method of countering the adverse effect
    on a jury of pre-trial prejudicial information from a bail hearing.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

  <br
clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>no longer be an effective remedy in any event, because the
    Internet preserves pre-trial publicity and search engines like Google make
    it easy for any person to access this information, regardless of location
    or time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[222]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The second observation
    I have relates to situations where there has already been pre-trial publicity
    from sources such as a police press conference. I reject the argument that
    in such situations there is no longer any need for a publication ban on similar
    prejudicial information that may come out at the bail hearing. I reject this
    argument for two reasons. The first is that the police must also be concerned
    with the fair trial rights of accused persons when they make information
    public outside a court setting. The fact that police disclosure has not been
    challenged in court does not mean that there are no limits on that activity.
    In that context, it is not useful for the court to use the fact that the
    police choose to publish some information they have about an accused as a
    basis for allowing the press to report the same or other potentially prejudicial
    information from the bail hearing. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[223]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second, and more
    importantly, there is an enormous difference, both in fact and in public
    perception, between information that is spoken outside court and information
    revealed in court proceedings. Although the rules of evidence are not strictly
    applied in bail hearings, a bail hearing is a court hearing and a report
    of evidence from a court hearing will be treated seriously by the public.
    By contrast, the public knows that information disclosed at a press conference
    is untested and it will be treated with much more scepticism by an informed
    public. The same can be said about an informed public’s reaction to local
    gossip: see Rosenberg J.A.’s reasons at para. 87, quoting the Ontario Royal
    Commission Inquiry into Civil Rights, <i>Report Number One</i>, vol. 2 (Ottawa:
    Queen’s Printer, 1968), at p. 763.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[224]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, I do
    not agree that a publication ban on bail proceedings will necessarily prevent
    witnesses from coming forward. If that is a real concern there are ways to
    address it, such as carefully conducted police press conferences. I also
    do not agree that a co-accused is significantly prejudiced by such a ban.
    The co-accuseds’ complaint appears to be with pre-trial publicity by the
    police and not with the courts or the administration of justice by the courts.</p>

style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[225]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The major salutary
    effect of the mandatory publication ban on bail proceedings is that it protects
    the fair trial rights of an accused from being undermined by a jury that
    may have been tainted by prejudicial information that will not be admissible
    at trial. Rosenberg J.A. views this salutary effect with scepticism, which
    is the main reason why he considers the deleterious effects as overriding.
    He views the social science research as inconclusive on the effect of pre-trial
    publicity on a jury. <i></i></p>

    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    (Attorney General)</i>, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 827, at para. 77 that in order to
    justify a provision targeted to address a harm that is not measurable, the
    government is not required to provide scientific proof of the harm. Rather, “where
    the court is faced with inconclusive or competing social science evidence
    relating the harm to the legislature’s measures, the court may rely on a
    reasoned apprehension of that harm.” This principle was recently applied
    by Sharpe J.A. in <i>Cochrane v.

    has acknowledged both in <i>Corbett </i>and in <i>Dagenais</i> that, although
    the effect of inadmissible information on a jury is not measurable, and although
    we place great trust in our juries, as a matter of logic and common sense,
    some jurors will be adversely affected by the knowledge of prejudicial information
    that is not part of the evidence at trial. It seems to me that it would be
    contrary to the decisions in these cases, where the issue was thoroughly
    considered (also see the dissenting reasons of La Forest J. in <i>Corbett</i>)
    and the link between pre-trial publication and potential jury contamination
    was accepted, to strike down legislation as unconstitutional on the basis
    that that link is speculative. <i></i></p>

    that some particularly prejudicial inadmissible information may influence
    jurors, Rosenberg J.A. rejects the position that a publication ban has a
    salutary effect and suggests instead a more targeted remedial order, such
    as a ban closer to trial or a change of venue as the better answer. However,
    it is clear that a ban on publication of the bail proceeding will have a
    salutary effect on fair trial rights in such a case. In contrast, for reasons
    I have already stated, the remedial measures suggested, while available in
    theory, would be costly for the accused and for the administration of justice
    both to obtain and to implement. <i></i></p>

    in time, it is unclear how legal aid will approach and address the problem
    that counsel will require funding to seek discretionary publication bans
    or tailored remedial orders such as change of venue, as well as to conduct
    trials out of town if changes of venue are ordered. We know that legal aid
    funds are limited and are being stretched to accommodate increasing needs.
    This is also a practical factor when we are discussing the salutary versus
    deleterious effects of a current measure that is simply applied and cost-effective.<i></i></p>

    refers to and essentially discounts the following four incidental salutary
    effects of a mandatory publication ban of bail proceedings: prevention of
    witness contamination, protection of ongoing criminal investigations, encouragement
    of witnesses and sureties to come forward and advancement of the privacy
    interests of the accused. While these may be viewed as extra benefits of
    a ban, I would give them no weight at this stage of the analysis. In my view,
    it was not the intent of Lamer C.J. in requiring a salutary versus deleterious
    effects comparison, that the court be overly concerned with the extent to
    which any side benefits of the measure may or may not be effective. The question
    in this case is whether, in practice, the deleterious effects are sufficient
    to overcome the benefit of an important measure, intended to protect the
    fair trial rights of accused persons under our law. </p>

style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[231]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I would add as
    a salutary effect the fact that, under s. 517, the ban is time limited and
    does not preclude the public and the press from attending the hearing. The
    process is open, and once the trial is complete, there is the opportunity
    for full discussion of any information that was not available to be reported
    earlier. I agree that any limit on the ability of the press to report or
    on the timing of when it can report on court proceedings is a serious breach
    of s. 2(b). However, the temporary nature of the ban ensures that the proceedings
    are not in any way being hidden from the public or that they will not be
    subject to public scrutiny. Of course the <i>Code </i>also contains a so

    on preliminary inquiry evidence in s. 539. As well, regardless of whether
    the accused requests the preliminary inquiry publication ban, s. 542(2) prohibits
    anyone from publishing reports of an admission or confession given at a preliminary
    inquiry until the end of the trial. All these provisions work together and

    this problem in the context of a discretionary ban regime is his decision
    that a justice is not required to give notice to the media when an accused
    asks for a discretionary ban to be ordered.  However, avoidance of delay

    <i> (Attorney General) v. JTI Macdonald Corp,</i> [2007] 2 S.C.R. 610, McLachlin
    C.J. described the last part of the proportionality test as follows at para.
    45:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The final question
    is whether there is proportionality between the <i>effects</i> of the measure
    that limits the right and the law’s <i>objective</i>. This inquiry focuses
    on the practical impact of the law. What benefits will the measure yield
    in terms of the collective good sought to be achieved? How important is the
    limitation on the right? When one is weighed against the other, is the limitation
    justified? [Emphasis in original.]</p>

line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[237]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In other words,
    after considering the strength of the law’s objective, the rational connection
    of the law to the objective and whether the law minimally impairs the <i>Charter </i>right
    that is being violated, the court is still directed to stand back and ensure
    that the positive effects of the law justify its negative impact on the affected <i>Charter</i> right. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[238]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In applying the
    test in the context of a publication ban sought to preserve fair trial rights,
    Lamer C.J. in <i>Dagenais</i>, at p.889-90, also directed that when the objective
    of the ban is to protect another <i>Charter </i>right, then two fundamental
    rights are in jeopardy and “it is essential in these circumstances to recognize
    that the pressing and substantial objective at issue is <i>itself</i> a fundamental
    right, and that, as such, it is a matter of exceptional importance.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[239]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In this case,
    the positive effect of the mandatory publication ban is to protect the fair
    trial rights of the accused by ensuring that an accused seeking bail on a
    charge where a jury trial is possible will know that if asked for, the court
    will order a publication ban on all information disclosed at the bail hearing,
    including prejudicial information that may not be admissible at the trial.
    The accused need not be concerned about seeking bail and about what information
    may be disclosed at the hearing, because the accused is guaranteed that any
    future jurors will not hear reports of potentially prejudicial information
    from the bail hearing which could affect their verdict and therefore, the
    accused’s fair trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[240]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The fact that
    the publication ban is mandatory and not discretionary is one of its most
    significant benefits. The <i>Dagenais </i>common law publication ban process
    is ill-suited to the bail context and structure, both procedurally and substantively.
    If only a discretionary ban were available following a <i>Dagenais </i>hearing,
    the accused’s right to reasonable bail, including an expeditious and cost-effective
    process, could be undermined. In <i>Canadian Newspapers Co. v. Canada (Attorney
    General)</i>, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 122, where the issue was the mandatory nature
    of a publication ban on the identity of sexual assault victims, the Supreme
    Court recognized that the ban had to be mandatory, otherwise victims might
    not come forward out of fear that they would be publicly identified. Similarly,
    an accused needs to be certain when seeking bail that whatever prejudicial
    information may be disclosed at the bail hearing will be protected from disclosure
    to potential jurors. If the ban is not mandatory, then the accused’s right
    to reasonable bail and, at the same time, the accused’s liberty interest
    may be undermined.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[241]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Requiring accused
    to regularly seek discretionary bans would also detrimentally affect the
    functioning of the bail system in Ontario, which, certainly in some regions,
    does not appear to be equipped to handle extended hearings and still deal
    with bail requests expeditiously.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[242]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As I have already
    stated in connection with the publication ban itself, it is also a salutary
    feature of the mandatory ban that it is not permanent, nor does it involve
    an <i>in camera</i> hearing. The ban is only temporary until the jury trial
    is complete. The press and the public are allowed to attend as with any court
    proceeding. Rosenberg J. A. recognizes these features in his analysis but
    does not give them weight as salutary effects. In my view they are significant
    features at this stage of the proportionality analysis because they have
    the effect of minimizing the limitation on freedom of the press.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[243]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is important
    to note that Parliament amended and re-enacted s. 517 in 2005 to include
    publication “in any document.” It did this after the Supreme Court’s decision
    in <i>Dagenais</i>. In so doing, Parliament can be seen to have rejected
    the recommendation of the Law Reform Commission of Canada in Working Paper
    56, <i>Public Media Access to the Criminal Process</i> (Ottawa, 1987) that
    the mandatory publication ban be repealed because of its effect on freedom
    of expression, and as a reaffirmation by Parliament of the choice it made
    in enacting s. 517 to balance the fair trial right with freedom of expression
    in the limited circumstance of a bail hearing.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[244]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The deleterious
    effect of the publication ban is its limit on freedom of expression and freedom
    of the press by preventing the publication of any information from the bail
    hearing, including the reasons for granting or denying bail. These <i>Charter </i>freedoms
    are critical for a free and democratic society and their importance cannot
    be minimized. That said, as discussed above, the limit is temporary and the
    court remains open.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[245]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I do not consider
    the fact that the ban is mandatory at the request of the accused to be a
    deleterious effect for the reasons I have already discussed. In my view,
    it is essential for the protection of the accused, for the operation of the
    bail system and for the efficient and effective administration of justice
    in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario that routine requests for a publication ban on bail proceedings where
    there may be a jury trial result in a mandatory order, not a discretionary
    hearing procedure.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[246]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I acknowledge
    that a deleterious effect of the legislation is that it extends to all information
    at the bail hearing and it is not tailored to cover only the information
    that is necessary to protect the fair trial rights of the accused. However,
    it is unclear that a more tailored ban would make a significant difference
    to the press. In cases where the press wish to report on bail proceedings,
    they will want to report fully and fairly and not be constrained to leave
    out potentially prejudicial material, such as a confession, criminal record,
    or similar fact evidence, especially where the judge’s decision regarding
    bail turns to any extent on that material. This practical concern may well
    explain Parliament’s decision to enact a full mandatory ban. <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[247]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In my view, the
    legislation reflects a reasonable choice by Parliament to enact a measure
    that meets its objective to promote the <i>Charter </i>fair trial right of
    the accused and is minimally impairing of the <i>Charter </i>right to freedom
    of expression. I conclude that, weighing the relevant salutary and deleterious
    effects of the legislation, the salutary effects outweigh the deleterious
    effects and therefore, the limitation on freedom of expression is justified.<i></i></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I have concluded
    that the limit on freedom of expression in s. 517 is justified to prevent
    the potential breach of the fair trial rights of an accused whose charges
    may possibly be tried by a jury. However, to the extent that the mandatory
    ban on bail proceedings applies in respect of charges that cannot be tried

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I agree with
    Rosenberg J.A. that reading down the legislation is the appropriate remedy
    for this legislation. In order to read down the section so that it will only
    apply where the accused may be tried by a jury, some words must be added.
    This was the remedy applied in <i>R. v. Sharpe</i>, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 45 at
    para. 114, where, in order to cure a problem of overbreadth, McLachlin C.J.
    held that the appropriate remedy was “to read into the law an exclusion of
    the problematic application of s. 163.1.” A similar approach was taken in <i>Ruby
    v.
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    (Solicitor General)</i>, [2002] 4 S.C.R. 3 at para. 60, where Arbour J. read
    down s. 51(2)(a) of the <i>Privacy Act</i>, <span style='color:black'>R.S.C.
    1985, c. P-21, by adding language to</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;

    to those circumstances where the government institution chose to make <i>ex

line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[250]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I propose the
    following revision to s. 517 in order to read down the mandatory ban:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>517. (1) If
    the prosecutor or the accused intends to show cause under section 515, he
    or she shall so state to the justice and the justice may, and shall on application
    by the accused <b><i>where and for so long as the charge(s) may be tried
    by a jury</i></b>,
    …</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[251]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The effect of
    the added phrase is to limit the mandatory publication ban at the request
    of the accused to bail proceedings in respect of charges that can possibly
    be tried by a court composed of a judge and jury. Consistent with the goal
    of effectively addressing the overbreadth problem while ensuring that an
    accused’s fair trial rights are preserved, the duration of the ban is limited,
    so that if through an election by the Crown or the defence the trial becomes
    a judge alone trial, either in the Ontario Court or the Superior Court, the
    ban no longer applies.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[252]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I realize that
    this revision to the duration of the ban does not co-ordinate precisely with
    the similar mandatory publication ban on preliminary inquiry evidence under
    s. 539 of the <i>Code</i>, where the ban continues in force until the accused
    is discharged or until the conclusion of the trial, whether by jury or judge
    alone. However, this approach is most consistent with the analysis that justifies
    the full mandatory ban on bail proceedings in order to ensure the fair trial
    of the accused before a jury. Parliament may well wish to consider and address
    both provisions and to apply its own wording to achieve the constitutional
    objectives of the legislation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='font-family:"Times New Roman"'>[253]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There is no need
    to suspend the operation of the section to accommodate the proposed read-down.
    The section will continue to operate as before, except it will apply in fewer
    cases.</p>

    still allows an accused who is charged with an offence that cannot be tried

    In <i>R. v. Mentuck</i> (2001), 158 C.C.C. (3d) 449 (S.C.C.), at para. 32,
    Iacobucci J. explained that a publication ban can be sought to protect “other
    crucial aspects of the administration of justice”. For example, if an accused
    will not be able to obtain bail without sureties and the court is satisfied
    that the identity of the sureties should be protected, a discretionary ban
    could be ordered to ensure that the accused is able to exercise the right
    to obtain reasonable bail. Presumably, such orders will be relatively rare
    and therefore any delays caused by such orders will not be so extensive as
    to affect the justice system as a whole.</p>
