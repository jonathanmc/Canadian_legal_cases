    appellant raises several issues with respect to the Minister’s surrender
    decision, arguing that his surrender would violate his s. 6(1) <i>Charter</i> right
    to remain in Canada and that the Minister’s decision was unreasonable.</p>
  <h3>(a) Was the Minister Unreasonable in Relying on
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      France</st1:country-region>
    ’s Assertion of Jurisdiction? </h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">France</st1:country-region>
    ’s claim to have jurisdiction over him for these purposes is antithetical
    to Canadian notions of justice and fair process and that the Minister’s reliance
    on
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">France</st1:country-region>
    ’s assertion of jurisdiction over the appellant was unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not accept this submission.  The Minister asked for and received clarification
    of the basis for jurisdiction from the French authorities.  In the absence
    of clear evidence to the contrary, the Minister was entitled to rely on the
    legal explanation he received as to the basis for
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">France</st1:country-region>
    ’s assertion of jurisdiction.  Moreover, as the Minister pointed out in his
    reasons, the notion of asserting jurisdiction over offences committed outside
    of
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    in cases of organized crime and terrorism is not antithetical to Canadian
    law.</p>
  <h3>(b) Were the appellant’s rights under s. 6(1) of the <i>Charter </i>violated?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant complains that various requests for further disclosure were rejected
    and asserts that the Minister’s conclusion – that the appellant’s s. 6(1) <i>Charter</i> right
    to remain in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    would <i>not</i> be violated - cannot be sustained. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    am not persuaded that there was any denial of procedural fairness or any
    other grounds that would allow this court to interfere with the Minister’s
    decision.  As the Minister noted, the negative impact of the appellant’s
    actions was felt predominantly if not entirely outside of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  The <i>Cotroni</i> assessment clearly favoured prosecution in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">France</st1:country-region>
    and revealed no prospect of prosecution in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>

  <h3>(c) Is the Surrender Order Inconsistent with the Result of the Extradition
    Hearing? </h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant contends that the Minister improperly ordered his surrender on
    the charge of membership in a terrorist organization in the face of the committal
    judge’s decision to discharge him on the charge of participation in a criminal
    organization.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>Extradition
      Act </i>1999, c.18, the relevant treaty and the applicable jurisprudence
      do not require that the foreign offences set out in the surrender order
      align precisely with the Canadian offences that formed the basis for the
      committal order.  The test is conduct-based and it is sufficient that the
      conduct of the person sought, if it occurred in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    , would have constituted an offence punishable under Canadian law: <i>McVey
    v. U.S.A.,</i> [1992] 3 S.C.R. 475.  However, the appellant relies on the
    principle that the Minister has no discretion to surrender for offences involving
    conduct that is not supported by the evidence at the committal hearing: see,
    e.g. <i>U.S.A. v. Gorcyca </i>(2007), 216 C.C.C. (3d) 403 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    )<b>, </b>at paras. <span lang=FR-CA>61-63; <i>U.S.A. v. Kissel</i> (2008),
    89 O.R. (3d) 481 (C.A.), at paras. </span>39-40 (leave to appeal refused
    2008 S.C.C.A. No. 250); <i>U.S.A. v. Reumayr </i>(2003), 176 C.C.C. (3d)
    377 (B.C.C.A.), at para. 42 (leave to appeal refused 2005 S.C.C.A. No. 474).  The
    appellant places particular emphasis on the following passage from the reasons
    of the committal judge: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[I]n my view, there is no evidence that Mr. Ouzghar
    had knowledge that persons participated [in the criminal organization] in
    the preceding five years with a series of indictable offences.  The evidence
    that might support that Mr. Ouzghar had an operational connection to the
    organization is not sufficient to provide the essential ingredients of the
    offence. I agree with counsel for Mr. Ouzghar that there is no evidence that
    the use of Mr. Ouzghar’s passport was intended for the benefit of a criminal
    organization or that Mr. Ouzghar had the necessary knowledge of the activities
    of the alleged members of the organization.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, those findings must be read in the light of the specific issue the
    committal judge was addressing, namely, the elements required to establish
    the Canadian offence, as it stood at the time, of participation in a criminal
    organization.  Section 467.1 of the <i>Criminal Code </i>stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1) Every one who</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) participates in or substantially contributes <i>to
      the activities</i> of a criminal organization knowing that any or all of
      the members of the organization engage in or have, within the preceding
      five years engaged in the commission of a series of indictable offences
      under this or any other Act of Parliament for each of which the maximum
      punishment is imprisonment for five years or more, and </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b) is party to the commission of an indictable
    offence for the benefit of, at the direction of or in association with the
    criminal organization for which the maximum punishment is imprisonment for
    five years or more is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment
    for a term not exceeding 14 years. (Emphasis added.)</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Section 467.1(2) defined “criminal
    organization” as:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Any group, association or other body consisting
    of five or more persons, whether formally or informally organized, having <i>as
    one of its primary activities</i> the commission of an indictable offence
    under this or any other Act of Parliament for which the maximum punishment
    is imprisonment for five years or more, and any or all of the members of
    which engage in or have, within the preceding five years, engaged in the
    commission of a series of offences. (Emphasis added.)</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    make out a case on this offence the prosecution was required to prove that
    the accused had participated or actively contributed to the “the activities
    of a criminal organization” and that the accused had knowledge that the members
    of the organization had committed certain offences within a stated period
    of time. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the Minister noted, those elements differ from what is required to make out
    the offence of membership in a terrorist organization under French law.  Article
    421-1of the French <i>Penal Code</i> provides that forgery and forgery related
    offences amount to acts of terrorism “where they are committed intentionally
    in connection with an individual or collective undertaking the purpose of
    which is seriously to disturb public order through intimidation or terror.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not agree that the Minister’s decision to make a surrender order for this
    offence was precluded by the fact that the appellant was discharged by the
    committal judge on the participation in a criminal organization charge.  The
    reasons of the committal judge do not amount to a finding that there is no
    evidence to support the elements of the French charge.  The fact that the
    elements of the Canadian offence, related to the <i>activities</i> of the
    organization and the prior misconduct of its members, were not established
    before the committal judge is simply not relevant to the French charge which
    relates to the <i>purpose</i> of the undertaking and the commission of certain
    specified crimes, including forgery. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    committal judge found that there was some evidence that the appellant:</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the light of those findings, as well as the evidence in the record of the <i>Muhajaddin
    Katiba</i>’s activities and the appellant’s contacts with its members, I
    cannot agree that the Minister’s decision to surrender the appellant on the
    charge of membership in a terrorist organization was unreasonable.</p>
