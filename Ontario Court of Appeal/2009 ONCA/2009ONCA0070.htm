  <h2>I.          Overview</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants, Elleanor Hill and several of her family members, sued the respondent,
    Dr. H. H. Allen, for damages allegedly arising from surgery performed by
    Dr. Allen on Mrs. Hill to correct a gynecological condition. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Following
    a 40-day trial, the trial judge found that the surgery performed was medically
    necessary and that Dr. Allen had not conducted the surgery in a negligent
    manner.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge further found that Dr. Allen was negligent in his care of Mrs.
    Hill because he failed to obtain her informed consent to the surgery.  However,
    he also concluded that a reasonable person in Mrs. Hill’s circumstances would
    have decided to have the surgery in question, even if she had been properly
    advised of the nature of the surgery and the risks and alternatives.  He
    therefore held that the appellants had failed to establish that Dr. Allen’s
    negligence caused Mrs. Hill’s injuries and, by judgment dated July 16, 2007,
    dismissed the appellants’ action against Dr. Allen.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants appeal the trial judge’s liability decision.  They argue that
    the trial judge erred by failing to consider what Mrs. Hill would have done
    if Dr. Allen had provided her with the benefit of his clinical assessment
    of the risks and benefits of the surgery and his recommendation whether to
    undergo the surgery.  They submit that, properly advised, Mrs. Hill would
    have declined the surgery and elected to continue with the form of non-surgical
    management of her medical condition employed prior to surgery.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    the reasons that follow, the appeal is dismissed.  On this record, it was
    open to the trial judge to find that Mrs. Hill would have undertaken the
    corrective surgery in question even if she had been properly advised by Dr.
    Allen regarding the surgery, its attendant risks and the available non-surgical
    alternative.  Accordingly, it cannot be said that any breach by Dr. Allen
    of a duty to fully and properly advise Mrs. Hill was causative of her injuries,
    so as to warrant a liability finding against Dr. Allen.</p>
  <h2>II.        Background</h2>
  <h2>(1)       Mrs. Hill’s Medical Condition and the Surgery</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mrs.
    Hill had a lengthy medical history.  Prior to the impugned surgery, she had
    undergone 11 surgical procedures for numerous purposes, including three caesarean
    sections, three laparoscopies, removal of an ovarian cyst, removal of a cyst
    from her bowel, removal of her right ovary, and removal of her gall bladder.  In
    addition, in 1981, when she was 29 years of age, Mrs. Hill had a hysterectomy
    as a result of uterine
    “prolapse” or displacement that caused abdominal pain.  Mrs. Hill also suffered
    from irritable bowel syndrome and epileptic seizures. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    1992, when Mrs. Hill was 40 years of age, she began to experience significant
    abdominal pain caused by “vaginal vault prolapse”.  Simply put, Mrs. Hill
    had a weak pelvic floor that allowed intra-abdominal pressures to push major
    organs (<i>e.g.</i> her uterus and vagina) downwards into a prolapsed or
    displaced position.  Although Mrs. Hill’s vaginal vault prolapse was regarded
    by her healthcare professionals as minor in nature, it nonetheless produced
    considerable discomfort and pain.  As is common with pelvic floor weakness,
    Mrs. Hill’s vaginal vault prolapse was also associated with urinary incon-tinence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    evidence at trial indicated that several surgical procedures had been utilized
    over the years to correct the type of gynecological problem experienced by
    Mrs. Hill, with varying degrees of success.  In particular, in the case of
    vaginal vault prolapse, a number of procedures involving the use of surgical
    mesh to repair the prolapse had been attempted.  Each of these procedures
    was designed to alleviate the pain caused by the prolapsed vagina by suspending
    the vagina with surgical mesh to restore it to a more normal anatomical position.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    June 1993, when Mrs. Hill underwent her surgery, a two-part surgical approach
    was often employed to address vaginal prolapse: vaginal vault suspension
    surgery was performed in tandem with a bladder suspension procedure.  The
    latter surgical intervention was intended to avoid causing or exacerbating
    urinary incontinence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Vaginal
    prolapse can also be treated by non-surgical means through the use of a “pessary” – a
    device that is inserted into the vagina to elevate the vaginal vault, thereby
    relieving the displacement of the vagina. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    was evidence at trial that patients with Mrs. Hill’s condition could use
    a pessary on a long-term basis.  However, there was also evidence that pessaries
    are inconvenient and sometimes cause vaginal infections or pain on intercourse.  Several
    experts testified that, as a result, few young, active women choose pessary
    use as a long-term option to cope with vaginal vault prolapse.  Moreover,
    it appears to be undisputed that in 1993, no pessaries existed that could
    address both vaginal vault prolapse and urinary incontinence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mrs.
    Hill initially used a pessary to manage her condition and to alleviate her
    abdominal pain.  However, she continued to experience urinary incontinence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    June 24, 1993, Dr. Allen performed surgery of his own design on Mrs. Hill
    to correct her vaginal vault prolapse and to suspend her bladder in an effort
    to alleviate her incontinence.  Dr. Allen’s procedure involved the placement
    of a large piece of surgical mesh under the bladder and suspension of the
    vaginal vault from the underside of the mesh.  It is this two-part surgical
    intervention that underlies the dispute in this case.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Unfortunately,
    Mrs. Hill experienced severe post-operative pain and inflammation in her
    lower back and pubic area.  She was unable to lift her legs and developed
    an infection and weakness in both legs.  She was diagnosed as having osteitis
    pubis (inflammation of the pelvic bones), which ultimately required corrective
    surgery to remove the mesh inserted by Dr. Allen.  She also developed bladder
    dysfunction and chronic pelvic and coccygeal pain,<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a> and experienced seizures more frequently.  Since
    1997, Mrs. Hill’s seizures have been controlled through the use of medication.  However,
    she has permanent bladder dysfunction and continues to suffer from incontinence,
    weakness in her legs, pain in her lower back, and coccygeal and pelvic pain.</p>
  <h2>(2)       Appellants’ Complaint</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    their factum, the appellants characterized the sole issue on appeal as one
    of causation, describing it in these terms: “what Mrs. Hill would have done
    if she had been properly informed” by Dr. Allen.  In respect of this issue,
    they argued:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>This is not, however, a typical informed consent
    case.  In the usual case, the plaintiff faces a high hurdle on causation,
    because the doctor recommended a medically reasonable option and the plaintiff
    must establish that she would not have followed the doctor’s advice.  In
    this case, Dr. Allen failed to make any recommendation at all.  The trial
    judge ignored that negligence and ignored the evidence that Allen’s recommendation <u>would
    have been to avoid the surgery</u>.  Faced with that advice, any reasonable
    patient in Mrs. Hill’s position would have chosen not to have the surgery.  [Emphasis
    in original.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Later
    in their factum, the appellants submitted:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Not only did Dr. Allen fail to recommend against
    surgery, he also failed to disclose the risks of surgery to Mrs. Hill.  He
    failed to tell her that the pessary was an option. </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:
center'>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In the face of Dr. Allen’s failure to disclose the
    necessary information and provide her with the recommendation as to what
    he believed was appropriate, the finding on causation cannot stand.  No reasonable
    patient would have opted for surgery in those circumstances, and Mrs. Hill
    herself would not have done so.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>During
    oral argument, the appellants maintained that the trial judge erred by failing “to
    consider and make findings concerning Dr. Allen’s failure to provide [Mrs.
    Hill] with the benefit of his clinical assessment and judgment regarding
    the risks and benefits of the surgery”.  This error, the appellants argued,
    fatally tainted the trial judge’s causation analysis as Dr. Allen’s clinical
    assessment and recommendation concerning the surgery, if provided, would
    have led Mrs. Hill “away from surgery”.  The appellants claimed that if Dr.
    Allen had fully and properly advised Mrs. Hill, he would have recommended
    against the surgery and Mrs. Hill would have followed his advice.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    our view, the appellants’ submissions engage both standard of care and causation
    issues.  However, nothing turns on whether the issues raised are considered
    under a standard of care or causation rubric, or some combination thereof.  In
    the end, for the reasons that follow, the appellants’ challenge to the trial
    judge’s liability decision cannot succeed under either approach.  </p>
  <h2>(3)       Trial Judge’s Decision</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge addressed the standard of care applicable in this case as enunciated
    in <i>terNeuzen v. Korn</i>, [1995] 3 S.C.R. 674, and the duty owed by Dr.
    Allen to adequately advise Mrs. Hill concerning the proposed surgery.  With
    respect to the duty to disclose, the trial judge indicated that a physician
    is required to advise a patient as to
    “the nature of the [proposed] treatment, the expected benefits of the treatment,
    the material risks of the treatment, the material side effects of the treatment,
    alternate courses of action and the likely consequences of not having the
    treatment”.  This was an accurate description of Dr. Allen’s duty to advise
    Mrs. Hill.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge also expressly considered whether Dr. Allen had adequately discharged
    this duty in relation to Mrs. Hill.  After reviewing the evidence bearing
    on the question of the information disclosed by Dr. Allen to Mrs. Hill prior
    to her surgery, and the positions of the parties concerning that evidence,
    the trial judge found that Dr. Allen failed to explain to Mrs. Hill:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    nature of the surgery that he proposed to perform, including: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>(a)
      the fact that the type of surgery proposed was a novel procedure developed
    by Dr. Allen himself; and </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>(b)
      the specifics of the procedure proposed and its possible effects, including
    the size of the mesh to be used to suspend Mrs. Hill’s vagina and the fact
    that the mesh could cause adhesions and distortion of Mrs. Hill’s bladder;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>that
    the continued use of a pessary was a possible long-term alternative to surgery;
    and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>that
    surgery was not required “if [Mrs. Hill] was prepared to put up with the
    urinary incontinence she was experiencing and if she was prepared to continue
    with the pessary on a long-term basis”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    light of these omissions, the trial judge held that Dr. Allen was negligent
    in failing to obtain Mrs. Hill’s informed consent to the surgery.  However,
    based on expert evidence that he accepted, the trial judge also held: that
    the surgery performed by Dr. Allen was “a medically acceptable solution to
    Mrs. Hill’s complaints”; that based on Mrs. Hill’s circumstances and complaints –
    including her age and level of activity, the surgery was necessary; and that
    no negligence in the actual conduct of the surgery could be attributed to
    Dr. Allen.  None of these holdings is challenged by the appellants.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge described the relevant causation inquiry in this fashion: “[W]hat
    a reasonable patient in Mrs. Hill’s position would have done if Dr. Allen
    had adequately explained the surgery to her and told her that long-term use

    is no suggestion that the trial judge misapprehended the legal test that
    governed his causation analysis.  He referred to the applicable authorities
    on this issue, including <i>Arndt v. Smith</i>, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 539, <i>Van
    Dyke v. Grey Bruce Regional Health Centre</i> (2005), 255 D.L.R. (4<span style='font-family:

    (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  In particular, he referred to the ‘modified objective test’ described
    in <i>Arndt</i> at paras. 6 and 9, as quoted in <i>Van Dyke</i> at paras.
    83 and 84 and first enunciated in <i>Reibl v. Hughes</i>, [1980] 2 S.C.R.
    880:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The test enunciated [in <i>Reibl</i>] relies on
    a combination of objective and subjective factors in order to determine whether
    the failure to disclose <i>actually</i> caused the harm of which the plaintiff
    complains.  It requires that the court consider what the reasonable patient <i>in
    the circumstances of the plaintiff</i> would have done if faced with the
    same situation.  The trier of fact must take into consideration any “particular
    concerns” of the patient and any “special considerations affecting the particular
    patient” in determining whether the patient would have refused treatment
    if given all the information about the possible risks.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Some of the criticisms directed at the <i>Reibl</i> test
    may stem from confusion as to what Laskin C.J. intended in his adoption of
    a modified objective test.  The uncertainty surrounds the basic premise that
    the test depends upon the actions of a reasonable person <i>in the plaintiff’s
    circumstances</i>.  Which aspects of the plaintiff’s personal circumstances
    should be attributed to the reasonable person?  There is no doubt that objectively
    ascertainable circumstances, such as the plaintiff’s age, income, marital
    status, and other factors, should be taken into consideration.  However,
    Laskin C.J. didn’t stop there.  He went on and stated that “special considerations” affecting
    the particular patient should be considered, as should any “specific questions” asked
    of the physician by the patient.  In my view, this means that the “reasonable
    person” who sets the standard for the objective test must be taken to possess
    the patient’s reasonable beliefs, fears, desires and expectations.  Further,
    the patient’s expec-tations and concerns will usually be revealed by the
    questions posed.  [Emphasis in original.]</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    accordance with this test, the trial judge reviewed the objective and subjective
    factors that he regarded as having influenced Mrs. Hill’s decision to undertake
    the surgery.  In so doing, he made the following critical findings of fact:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>based
    on her previous experience with surgeries and a discussion with Dr. Allen
    during an office visit on June 4, 1993, Mrs. Hill knew that the procedure
    at issue was major surgery;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>as
    Mrs. Hill had great confidence in Dr. Allen, the fact that the surgery was
    a procedure designed by Dr. Allen and involved the insertion of a large piece
    of mesh beneath her bladder, “would not have bothered [Mrs. Hill]”.  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>On the contrary, Mrs. Hill would have accepted Dr.
    Allen’s explanation that the failure rate with his procedure was better than
    that experienced with the alternative form of surgery often employed to correct
    vaginal vault prolapse; and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mrs.
    Hill was “fed up” with the problems caused by the pessary, including the
    incontinence and other problems associated with its use, and was “surgery
    ready”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge also considered, and rejected, Mrs. Hill’s claim that she would
    not have had the surgery if she had been fully advised by Dr. Allen.  He
    stated:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I am also satisfied that a reasonable patient in
    Mrs. Hill’s circumstances would have decided to have the Marlex mesh [to
    correct her vaginal vault prolapse] and MMK [to correct her incontinence]
    procedures if she had been properly informed of the nature of the surgery
    involved, and the risks and the alternatives.  I therefore find that the
    plaintiffs have failed to prove that Dr. Allen’s negligence in failing to
    obtain Mrs. Hill’s informed consent caused her injuries.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:
center'>….</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The only mistake Dr. Allen made was to book Mrs.
    Hill for surgery without obtaining her informed consent.  Dr. Allen’s negligence
    in failing to obtain Mrs. Hill’s informed consent did not, however, cause
    her injuries.</p>
  <h2>III.       Analysis</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    focus of the appellants’ argument before this court is twofold.  They submit
    that the trial judge erred by failing to consider and find that: (i) Dr.
    Allen failed to provide Mrs. Hill with the benefit of his clinical assessment
    concerning the risks and benefits of the surgery ultimately carried out;
    and (ii) Dr. Allen neglected to recommend whether the surgery should be undertaken
    in preference to the non-surgical option of the continued use of a pessary
    on a long-term basis.  The appellants claim that, as a result of these errors,
    the trial judge omitted a “critical” component of the requisite causation
    analysis and consequently, his causation conclusion cannot stand.  We will
    deal with these arguments in reverse order.</p>
  <h2>(1)       Alleged Failure to Make a Recommendation </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants initially maintained that the trial judge erred by failing to
    consider and find that Dr. Allen’s negligence included his failure to make
    any recommendation for or against the surgery and non-surgical alternatives.  Ultimately,
    however, the appellants’ counsel acknowledged during oral argument that Dr.
    Allen had no legal obligation to make such a specific recommendation.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    was a proper and responsible concession.  In <i>Zampro v. Birsson</i> (1981),
    32 O.R. (2d) 75 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), this court rejected the notion that a surgeon’s failure to make any recommendation
    regarding the advisability of elective surgery constituted negligence.  In <i>Zampro</i> at
    pp. 84-85, Wilson J.A., Brooke J.A. concurring, stated:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[T]he election in the case of elective surgery is
    the patient’s election.  True, it must be the election of a fully-informed
    patient, one who has been apprised of the benefits of the surgery and warned
    of all the risks. …</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>While it may be that a surgeon is under a duty to
    give his patient his assessment of how the benefits of surgery measure up
    against the risks of having it, it seems to me that in the case of elective
    surgery only the patient can truly evaluate the benefits for him or her.  There
    is a substantial subjective element to the evaluation of those benefits which
    are more than merely physical.  There are sociological and psycho-logical
    aspects, the importance of which will vary from patient to patient.  Should
    the surgeon step outside his area of medical and surgical expertise and tell
    the patient what is “best”
    for him or her?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:
center'>….</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[W]ith great respect I do not think we should put
    the surgeon in the position where the only safe course for him to follow
    in the case of elective surgery (which he normally would assume he will perform
    in a non-negligent manner) is to advise against it.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>See also <i>Khoshmashrab v. Bent</i>,

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    surgery at issue in this case was not minor.  Nor was it “almost cosmetic
    surgery” of the type at issue in <i>Zampro</i>.  Nevertheless, it was elective
    surgery in the sense that Mrs. Hill could have continued with her use of
    a pessary on a long-term basis, instead of undergoing surgery.  On the trial
    judge’s findings, Dr. Allen did not specifically advise Mrs. Hill of this
    non-surgical alternative.  In large measure, the trial judge’s finding that
    Dr. Allen did not obtain Mrs. Hill’s informed consent to the surgery rests
    on this important deficiency in Dr. Allen’s advice to his patient.  However,
    this does not mean that Dr. Allen should also have been found negligent on
    the discrete ground that he failed to provide Mrs. Hill with a recommendation
    whether to undertake the surgery.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    any event, it is not clear that Dr. Allen failed to recommend the surgery
    to Mrs. Hill.  On the contrary, parts of the trial judge’s reasons suggest
    that he found that Dr. Allen did make a specific recommendation in favour
    of the surgery.  For example, while the trial judge held that Dr. Allen did
    not properly inform Mrs. Hill of the nature of the relevant surgery and of “the
    risks and alternatives”, he also said: “Mrs. Hill had great confidence in
    Dr. Allen.  The fact that <i>the procedure Dr. Allen recommended</i> was
    his own procedure … would not have bothered her”

style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    we have said, the trial judge addressed Dr. Allen’s duty to adequately advise
    Mrs. Hill about the surgery.  Indeed, this formed a critical part of his
    negligence analysis.  In describing the nature of this duty, the trial judge
    expressly adverted to the requirement to tell Mrs. Hill of the “expected <i>benefits</i> of
    the treatment, the material <i>risks</i> of the treatment, the material side
    effects of the treatment” and “<i>alternate courses of action</i>” (emphasis
    added).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge went on to make specific findings concerning the nature of Dr.
    Allen’s negligence in relation to his duty to advise Mrs. Hill.  These included
    findings that Dr. Allen failed to inform Mrs. Hill of alternatives to the
    surgery, namely, the long-term use of a pessary, and the consequences if
    surgery was not undertaken – for example, continued urinary incontinence.  It
    is implicit in the trial judge’s negligence findings that he recognized that
    Mrs. Hill was entitled to Dr. Allen’s best judgment, based on his clinical
    knowledge and experience, as to the risks and benefits of the surgery and
    the available non-surgical options.  The obligation to provide Mrs. Hill
    with the benefit of such an assessment drove the negligence findings made
    by the trial judge.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants’ real complaint is that the trial judge failed to make a <i>particular</i> negligence
    finding against Dr. Allen: namely, that Dr. Allen was negligent in failing
    to make a specific recommendation to Mrs. Hill regarding the advisability
    of the surgery in all the circumstances.  As we understood their argument,
    although the appellants ultimately acknowledged that Dr. Allen had no affirmative
    legal obligation to recommend for or against the surgery, they maintain that
    his failure to make such a recommendation is nevertheless material as Dr.
    Allen would have advised against the surgery had he made any recommendation
    at all, and Mrs. Hill would have accepted his advice.  On this basis, the
    appellants argue that the trial judge erred by holding that a reasonable
    person in Mrs. Hill’s circumstances would have decided to have the surgery
    even if she had been properly advised by Dr. Allen.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    reject this argument for several reasons.  First, the determination of the
    specifics of Dr. Allen’s negligence is a matter squarely within the trial
    judge’s domain.  His findings concerning those of Dr. Allen’s acts or omissions
    that constituted negligence attract considerable deference from this court.  Absent
    palpable and overriding error, there is no room for appellate interference
    with those findings.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Similarly,
    with respect to causation, the legal error asserted by the appellants concerns
    the trial judge’s factual analysis resulting in his conclusion that a reasonable
    person in Mrs. Hill’s circumstances would have decided to have the two-part
    surgery performed by Dr. Allen even if she had been properly advised of the
    nature of the involved surgery and “the risks and the alternatives”.  This
    involves consideration of the trial judge’s interpretation of the evidence
    as a whole, as it relates to the modified objective causation test.  In order
    to reverse the trial judge’s conclusions on this issue, the appellants must
    establish palpable and overriding error: see for example, <i>Huisman v. MacDonald</i>,
    2007 ONCA 391, at paras. 52-53.  In our opinion, this exacting standard for
    appellate intervention has not been met in this case.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    as we have indicated, the trial judge held that the surgery was “a medically
    acceptable solution to Mrs. Hill’s complaints” and that, given Mrs. Hill’s
    circumstances and complaints, the surgery carried out by Dr. Allen was necessary.  The
    trial judge further held that the surgery performed was within the applicable
    reasonable standard of care.  On these unchallenged findings, regardless
    of the deficiencies in Dr. Allen’s advice to Mrs. Hill, the surgery was both
    appropriate and a reasonable option to offer Mrs. Hill.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants contend that Dr. Allen testified that if he had provided a recommendation
    to Mrs. Hill, “it would have been to continue with the pessary” and “to avoid
    the surgery”.  They point especially to Dr. Allen’s testimony on discovery
    that, “[I]f you can find a way not to have this person have an operation <i>that
    they will accept</i>, then that’s certainly desirable” (emphasis added) and
    at trial that, confronted with the problem of minor stress incontinence and
    effective use of a pessary, he would recommend that: “Mrs. Hill carry on
    [with the pessary] and <i>that she decide when its – when her symptoms are
    severe enough that she wishes something done about it</i>.  That’s entirely
    her decision” (emphasis added.)</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    to focus on only these parts of Dr. Allen’s testimony in isolation takes
    his evidence out of context and ignores his explicit caution that non-surgical
    options must be treatments that the patient “will accept”.  Dr. Allen testified
    about the prospects of a patient like Mrs. Hill accepting the long-term use
    of a pessary as an alternative to surgery.  He said in part: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[M]ost young people don’t want to do that [use a
    pessary on a long-term basis] because they, especially in a person who reacts
    a little bit and produces a discharge.  They’re going to have to use that
    cream for the rest of their life to keep that, to keep that discharge down … so,
    I don’t think I’ve had anybody 40 years old decide to carry on indefinitely.  I’ve
    had people carry on for a while until they got, maybe their job, they were
    going to retire in two years or something like that, but I don’t think I’ve
    ever had anybody carry on, 40 years old, carry on for the rest of their life
    with a, with a pessary of any kind.</p>

    to Mrs. Hill’s testimony, Mrs. Hill telephoned Dr. Allen on April 1, 1993
    because “she was con-cerned about urine loss, vaginal discharge and a rash” and “to
    ask him about surgery to correct her incontinence”.  This call occurred almost
    four months before the re-evaluation and follow-up recommended by Dr. Allen;

    their April 1, 1993 telephone call, Dr. Allen told Mrs. Hill that he could
    repair her incontinence and vaginal vault prolapse with the two-part surgery
    ultimately conducted.  Dr. Allen also explained the operation to Mrs. Hill
    and told her that it would not relieve all her symptoms.  He then told Mrs.
    Hill that she would have to meet with him, and an office visit was scheduled
    for June 4, 1993.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    was against this factual backdrop, which suggests that Mrs. Hill’s incontinence
    had become unacceptable to her, that the trial judge found that Mrs. Hill
    was “fed up with her incontinence and the other problems associated with
    the use of the pessary”, and was ready for surgery.  Contrary to the appellants’
    submission, these findings were open to the trial judge on the evidence.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    all these circumstances, we do not accept the appellants’ claim that Dr.
    Allen would have recommended against surgery for Mrs. Hill had he made a
    specific recommendation concerning it.  On the contrary, given Mrs. Hill’s
    conduct and her condition at the beginning of April 1993, her continuing
    complaints of incontinence, and her discussion with Dr. Allen on April 1,
    1993, Dr. Allen’s evidence may be read as suggesting that he would have recommended
    the two-part surgery as an alternative to a treatment that was no longer
    acceptable to Mrs. Hill (the continued use of a pessary) and to respond to
    her wishes to do something about her incontinence and the problems associated
    with the pessary.</p>

    is a third important factor to be considered.  The appellants submit that
    if Mrs. Hill had been properly informed of the risks and benefits of the
    surgery and if she had the benefit of Dr. Allen’s clinical assessment and
    advice on the choice of corrective surgery versus the continued use of a
    pessary, she would have chosen the latter option.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>But
    the trial judge expressly rejected Mrs. Hill’s evidence that she would have
    refused the surgery if she had been fully advised by Dr. Allen.  In the trial
    judge’s opinion, Mrs. Hill “was not … always a reliable witness”.  He held
    that given Mrs. Hill’s inaccurate evidence on discovery, the conflicting
    histories of urinary problems given by her to two other physicians, and her
    difficulty remembering some aspects of her medical history, her testimony
    at trial that she would have continued with a pessary if she had been properly
    advised by Dr. Allen, “cannot be relied upon”.  Thus, the trial judge’s credibility-based
    findings were adverse to Mrs. Hill.  These findings attract great deference
    from this court.</p>

    there is ample evidential support for the trial judge’s finding that Mrs.

    note, as did the trial judge, that Mrs. Hill had a history of major abdominal
    and other surgery in the past.  On the trial judge’s undisputed findings,
    she knew that the surgery to be carried out by Dr. Allen was a major abdominal
    procedure involving the insertion of mesh to suspend her vagina and bladder.  In
    addition, the trial judge found that although Dr. Allen told Mrs. Hill that
    the surgery was not going to relieve all her symptoms or improve her irritable
    bowel syndrome, Mrs. Hill nevertheless wanted Dr. Allen to look at her bowel
    to determine if he could correct that condition.  As the trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It is therefore apparent that prior to Dr. Allen’s
    surgery, Mrs. Hill’s health was tenuous.  The irritable bowel syndrome caused
    her abdominal pain, pelvic pressure and urgency.  In order to improve her
    health, Mrs. Hill quit her job as a home care worker, dropped out of a case
    management course and consulted Dr. Allen.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    record also reveals numerous complaints by Mrs. Hill to various healthcare
    providers about her incontinence, the need to wear incontinence pads and
    her continuing experience with vaginal infections and rashes.  The trial
    judge held:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The pessary was causing an infection, a discharge,
    a rash and incontinence, and it would probably cause pain on inter-course.  Mrs.
    Hill was occasionally wearing a pad for incontinence and she did not want
    to continue with the pessary.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>Contrary to the appellants’
    submission, these findings were grounded in the evidence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mrs.
    Hill’s continuing ailments are most unfortunate.  But whatever the short-comings
    in Dr. Allen’s advice to Mrs. Hill, we are unable to accept that the trial
    judge erred by concluding that, properly advised, Mrs. Hill would have chosen
    to undergo the surgery at issue.  Indeed, on this record, there is compelling
    support for that conclusion.</p>
