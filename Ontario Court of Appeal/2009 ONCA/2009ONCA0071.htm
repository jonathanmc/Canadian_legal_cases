      appellants (the “Solicitors”) provided legal services to the respondents
      (the
    “Clients”) regarding a condominium development project, for which the Solicitors
    billed the Clients a total of $451,044.94.  Following an assessment of the
    Solicitors’
    accounts pursuant to s. 3 of the <i>Solicitors Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.15,
    the total bill was reduced to $179,250.43.  The Solicitors’ motion to the
    Superior Court seeking an order that the report and certificate of the assessment
    officer not be confirmed was dismissed.  The Solicitors now appeal to this
    court from the order of the motion judge.</span></p>

      Act</i> and, more specifically, what is meant by the phrase “where the
      retainer of the solicitor is not disputed” in s. 3.  Pursuant to this provision,
      the assessment officer has jurisdiction to conduct an assessment only
    “where the retainer of the solicitor is not in dispute”.</span></p>

      and, accordingly, that the assessment officer erred in conducting the assessment,
      contrary to <br>
    s. 3 of the <i>Solicitors Act</i>.  The Solicitors further submit that the
    assessment officer improperly relied on the evidence and report of an expert
    in condominium law to assist him in determining the terms of the retainer.</span></p>

    that they could realize a greater and more immediate profit by converting
    the building from apartments to condominiums.</span></p>

      Gibson

    following day, on April 30, the Solicitors forwarded a retainer letter for
    the Clients’
    approval (the “retainer letter”).  The relevant portions of the retainer
    letter are as follows:</span></p>

      soon as Peoples Trust became aware of the project’s change to a condominium
      conversion, it withdrew its financing on the grounds that this change violated
      the terms of its agreement with the Clients and that construction of a
      condominium project was more complex and subject to greater regulation
      than construction of an apartment building.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Due
      largely to the withdrawal of financing by Peoples Trust and to the decision
      to change the project to a condominium conversion, a myriad of difficulties
      arose, which included, among others, difficulties in securing new lenders,
      cash flow problems, changes  in the project architect and engineer, as
      well as amendments to the physical height and layout of the building.  These
      problems, in turn, resulted in a significant increase in the amount of
      legal work required to complete the project.  To further complicate matters,
      the Clients were unable to sell any of the condominium units in 2002 due
      to inactivity in the condominium market in that year.  Further, numerous
      liens were registered on the property and the Clients experienced difficulties
      in satisfying the prerequisite to the sale of condominium units,  enrolment
      in what was then known as the Ontario New Home Warranty Program (“ONHWP”),
      now referred to as Tarion.  Considerable involvement by the Solicitors
      was ultimately required to remove the liens and salvage the project.  In
      2003, however, when the condominium market improved, units started to sell
      and, by July, 2003, the condominium was finally registered with the ONHWP.  By
      the end of the summer, most of the units had been sold.</span></p>

      the opening of the assessment hearing, the Solicitors raised the objection
      that most of the accounts complained of by the Clients were older that
      one month and, in accordance with s. 3(b) of the <i>Solicitors Act</i>,
      the clients should have obtained a judge’s order for assessment, rather
      than a <i>Praecipe</i> Order.</span></p>

      or setting aside the <i>Praecipe</i> Order, he had no choice but to comply
      with the terms of the <i>Praecipe</i> Order.  As no request for an adjournment
      was then made by the Solicitors at the time to bring the motion before
      a judge, the assessment officer proceeded with the assessment. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Experts’
    reports were filed by both parties: the Clients filed a report by Deborah
        Bellinger, a recognized expert in condominium and construction law; and,
        the Solicitors filed a report by Philip Rimer, a lawyer with experience
        in the financing, acquisition, and restructuring of condominium projects
        and other real estate assets.  In her report, Bellinger outlined the
        typical or conventional legal services provided by a lawyer in the development
        of a condominium project and opined that $50,000 was a reasonable estimate
        of the fees generally charged for those services.  Rimer, on the other
        hand, who acknowledged that he was not an expert in condominium law,
        opined that the Clients’ condominium project involved a significant number
        of unforeseen events and, accordingly, legal services, which were not
        typical or conventional.  Increased legal fees where therefore justified.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At
      the assessment hearing, the Solicitors took the position that the $50,000
      fee estimate set out in the retainer letter covered only the basic legal
      services in respect of the condominium conversion.  In their view, most
      of the work they performed went beyond what was contemplated in the $50,000
      estimate and was therefore properly characterized as additional fees and
      billed at the hourly rates set out in the retainer letter.  The Clients,
      on the other hand, argued that the $50,000 estimate contemplated most of
      the work performed by the Solicitors, and only a minimal amount of the
      completed work fell outside of the scope of this amount.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      assessment officer relied on Bellinger’s report in concluding that much
      of the work billed by the Solicitors as additional fees actually fell within
      the scope of the $50,000 estimated fee set out in the retainer letter.  Accordingly,
      the assessment officer reduced the total bill to $179,250.43.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      Solicitors brought a motion in the Superior Court opposing confirmation
      of the assessment officer’s report and certificate, based on two main grounds:
      first, that the <i>Praecipe</i> Order was invalid and the assessment officer
      exceeded his jurisdiction under <br>
    s. 3 of the <i>Solicitors Act</i> by conducting an assessment when the retainer
    was in dispute; and, second, that the assessment officer committed an error
    in principle by relying on Bellinger’s expert report to disallow certain
    of the Solicitors’ costs.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      dismissing the Solicitors’ motion, the motion judge held that the Solicitors
      were estopped from raising the validity of the <i>Praecipe</i> Order at
      such a late stage.  The motion judge noted that the Solicitors failed to
      explain not only why they did not raise the issue previously, but also
      why they had not proceeded with their earlier motion.  Accordingly, the
      motion judge held that reviewing the <i>Praecipe</i> Order and its validity
      at such a late stage would be patently unfair and would amount to an abuse
      of process.</span></p>

      respect to the jurisdiction of the assessment officer, the motion judge
      held that the retainer was not in dispute, as the Solicitors’ authority
      to perform the work described in the invoices was never disputed.  That,
      according to the motion judge, was “the nub of the retainer.  The assessment
      officer was properly evaluating the value of the services in the context
      of the budget letter.”  The motion judge therefore dismissed the Solicitors’ motion
      and, in so doing, confirmed the assessment officer’s report and certificate.</span></p>

  <h3><span lang=EN-US>(a)       Did the assessment officer exceed his jurisdiction
      in conducting an assessment of the interim accounts rendered to the Clients?</span></h3>

      Solicitors argued that the assessment officer exceeded his jurisdiction
      in conducting the assessment of bills delivered more than one month prior
      to the date that the Clients requisitioned the assessment, contrary to
      s. 3(b) of the <i>Solicitors Act</i>.  However, the Solicitors advised
      in oral submissions that they would not be pressing this ground of appeal. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      my view, this ground of appeal is without merit.  The bills assessed by
      the assessment officer consisted of a series of interim accounts delivered
      to the Clients which culminated in a final account dated less than one
      month prior to the date of the requisition.  Consequently, all of the interim
      accounts can properly be characterized as part of one continuing matter
      related to the condominium conversion project.  The Solicitors neglected
      to pursue their motion for the determination of this issue before a judge
      prior to the assessment.  As a result, the assessment officer had no option
      but to assess all of the bills rendered.  In any event, as set out by this
      court in <i>Price v. Sonsini</i> (2002), 60 O.R. (3d) 257 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), interim bills can be assessed as part of the assessment of the final account.  In <i>Price</i>,
    at para. 16, Sharpe J.A. highlighted the underlying policy of this rule,
    where he stated as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A rule that required clients to move for immediate
    assessment of interim accounts would force clients into the invidious position
    of straining, if not rupturing, the solicitor-client relationship before
    the retainer has ended.  Clients should not be forced to choose between harming
    the solicitor-client relationship and foregoing the right to have an interim
    account assessed.  Rather, under s. 3, clients should be entitled to move
    for an assessment of an interim account within one month of delivery of the
    final account.</p>

      to s. 3, the assessment officer has jurisdiction only “where the retainer

      as to the retainer is a condition precedent to the registrar’s authority
      to issue an order for assessment on requisition pursuant to s. 3.  Accordingly,
      once it appears that the retainer is disputed, the assessment officer cannot

      retainer and the terms thereof are articulated in the retainer letter,

      performed was properly billed at the Solicitors’ hourly rates, although
      the assessment officer was still entitled to assess this portion of the
      bill.  In other words, the dispute did not relate to the existence or terms
      of the retainer but, instead, focused on the proper allocation of the hours
      worked as between the $50,000 fixed fee portion and the hourly rate portion
      of the retainer, as well as the appropriateness of the work and amount
      charged within each category.  Therefore, in my view, the retainer was
      not in dispute within the meaning of s. 3 of the <i>Solicitors Act</i>.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>(c)       Did the assessment officer improperly rely on

      Solicitors further argue that the assessment officer improperly relied
      on the evidence of Bellinger in two ways.  First, they submit that Bellinger’s
      evidence should not have been used by the assessment officer to determine
      the essential terms of the retainer.  Second, they submit that the assessment
      officer wrongly concluded that the Solicitors should have advised the clients
      to abandon the condominium conversion when, in fact, no evidence was led
      that the Clients sought or received advice in this regard from the Solicitors.  I
      disagree with these submissions.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>i)         The terms of the retainer</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As
      set out above, I have concluded that the terms of the retainer were clearly
      articulated in the April 30, 2002 retainer letter and that the disagreement
      between the parties was strictly in respect of the proper characterization
      and apportionment of the work performed.  Whereas the Solicitors viewed
      the vast majority of the time docketed as additional work outside the scope
      of the $50,000 quoted, the Clients believed that most of the time spent
      was either included in the $50,000 fee or, alternatively, was excessive
      and of little value.  Unfortunately, the accounts provided by the Solicitors
      were of limited assistance to the assessment officer, as they did not allocate
      the work between the two categories.  Instead, the Solicitors simply billed
      all of the work at their regular hourly rates, despite the provision in
      the retainer letter which outlined the services that were included in the
      set amount of $50,000.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Bellinger’s
      report was tendered by the Clients to assist the assessment officer in
      allocating the work billed by the Solicitors between the two categories.  Based
      on her comprehensive review of the work performed and billed by the Solicitors
      and the terms of the retainer letter itself, as well as on her experience
      and expertise in condominium law, Bellinger concluded as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[T]he excess in actual costs over
      budget appear to relate to insufficient experience on the part of Mr. Gibson
      and his colleagues to anticipate all of the work that [was] involved in
      the project and an inability to complete the work in an efficient and cost
      effective manner.  Very little of the work undertaken on the project can
      be attributed to the actions of the client or other professionals or to
      unforeseen circumstances or complexities beyond Mr. Gibson’s control.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      other words, Bellinger concluded that the $50,000 budgeted fee contemplated
      all of the legal work that should have been anticipated by the Solicitors
      given the state of the project at the time the fee was quoted.  The assessment
      officer agreed with Bellinger’s conclusion and found as a fact that, at
      the time the retainer was drafted and the budgeted fee was provided or,
      very shortly thereafter, the Solicitors knew or should have known of most
      of the problems the Clients would encounter in completing the conversion
      project.  In my view, the assessment officer properly relied on Bellinger’s
      report to assist him in his determination of the proper quantum and not,
      as the Solicitors suggest, to guide him in ascertaining the essential terms
      of the retainer.  As I have already explained, the terms of the retainer
      were never in dispute; the dispute was solely with respect to the characterization
      and apportionment of the services provided by the Solicitors pursuant to
      that retainer.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>ii)        Based on Bellinger’s evidence, did the assessment
      officer erroneously conclude that the Solicitors should have advised the
      Clients to abandon the condominium conversion?</span></h3>

lang=EN-US>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After
      agreeing with Bellinger’s conclusion, the assessment officer states that “the
      solicitor did not perform adequate due diligence at the outset and failed
      to advise his clients as to the perils of proceeding with a conversion
      from rental to condominium units.”  The Solicitors submit that this finding
      is an error, as it wrongly assumes that the Solicitors had been retained
      to advise the Clients as to whether or not they should proceed with the
      conversion.  The Solicitors submit that this error resulted from the assessment
      officer’s misinterpretation of Bellinger’s report, namely, his earlier
      incorrect reference to Bellinger having established “that the [Solicitors
      were] initially consulted about the feasibility of converting from rental
      to condominium.”</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
      would not give effect to this submission.  Although the assessment officer’s
      reference to the Solicitors having been consulted about the feasibility
      of the conversion was in error, in my view, it was not central to the assessment
      officer’s decision.  Rather, the decision was based on Bellinger’s conclusion
      that the excess costs resulted from the Solicitors’ “insufficient experience”,
      their failure to “anticipate all of the work involved in the project”,
      and their “inability to complete the work in an efficient and cost effective
      manner”.  It was not based on whether the Solicitors had initially been
      consulted as to the feasibility of the conversion. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>When
      the assessment officer refers to the Solicitors’ failure both to “perform
      adequate due diligence at the outset” and to advise “as to the perils of
      proceeding with a conversion from rental to condominium units”, he is simply
      indicating that the Clients expected, quite properly, that the $50,000
      fee covered all the services needed to complete the project as viewed by
      an experienced condominium solicitor at that time.  Further, the Solicitors
      never informed the Clients that they had underestimated the fee and that
      the costs were, in fact, spiraling out of control, nor did they attempt
      to reconcile the interim accounts rendered to the Clients with the $50,000
      budgeted fee.  The Solicitors, therefore, cannot now complain that they
      underestimated the fee; this mistake was the result of their own inexperience
      and/or lack of due diligence.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>d)        Assessment of the Solicitors’ work to resolve
      the construction liens </span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
      have some concern about the assessment officer’s treatment of several of
      the accounts that relate to the Solicitors’ work to resolve construction
      liens.  These accounts, numbers 4303, 4442, 4488, and 4712, which total
      approximately $47,000, were disallowed entirely by the assessment officer
      because, in his view, they resulted from the Solicitors’
    lack of due diligence at the outset of the retainer.  The record, however,
    does not support this finding.  Specifically, Bellinger’s report included
    the construction lien issues among those issues that could not reasonably
    have been anticipated by the Solicitors at the time the retainer letter was
    drafted and, accordingly, suggested that the time spent dealing with these
    issues should “be billed at regular hourly rates <u>unless</u> there were
    specific discussions with the client or other circumstances that might suggest
    that the work was anticipated when the estimate was prepared” (emphasis in
    original).  Neither the assessment officer nor the parties referred to any
    evidence to show that there was any discussion or that there were other circumstances
    at the time the retainer letter was drafted to suggest that the Solicitors
    anticipated or should have anticipated the lien issues.  Therefore, there
    is no basis for the assessment officer’s finding that, with due diligence,
    the lien issues would have been anticipated by the Solicitors and thus included
    in the $50,000 fee.  Accordingly, these accounts should not have been fully
    disallowed.  </span></p>

      light of the delays already endured in this matter, in my view, it is in
      the best interests of both parties that this court set the proper amount
      for these accounts, rather than returning the matter to the assessment
      officer.  The amount allowed, however, should be somewhat less than the
      full amount being claimed by the Solicitors for these accounts because,
      as Bellinger observed, the charges recorded by the Solicitors included
    “significant time recorded for administrative or secretarial tasks, that
    form part of the costs of doing business but are not typically passed on
    to the client”.  I would therefore allow $44,000 for the lien work.</span></p>
