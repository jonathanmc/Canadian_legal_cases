    in the summer of 2003, a tall, heavy, unkempt man wearing a baseball cap,

      two and one-half hours after the last incident, police arrested Craig John

      robbery and disguise with intent. </span></p>

      MacCormack’s trial, the prosecution took the position that the same person
      committed each offence and that person was MacCormack. The offence committed
      in each case was robbery because of the threat of violence implicit in
      the bandit’s demand for money. The prosecutor invited the trial judge to
      apply the evidence adduced on all counts in reaching a conclusion on an
      individual count. </span></p>

      guilt on any individual count. And, at all events, the offence committed
      was theft, not robbery.</span></p>

      were robbery and disguise with intent. The offences were sufficiently similar
      that the evidence on all counts could be taken into account in determining

      John MacCormack (the appellant) appeals his convictions. His principal
      ground of appeal is that the trial judge erred in applying the evidence
      adduced on all counts in determining the adequacy of the prosecutor’s proof
      on each individual count. The appellant also urges that the principal offence
      committed in each incident was theft, not robbery. </span></p>

    cap with an emblem on the front, sunglasses, a golf shirt, shorts, black
    shoes and white socks entered the bank. The man, who was carrying a newspaper
    walked directly to the wicket of teller Cheryl Simpson and, in a low voice,
    said to Ms. Simpson “give me your hundreds, fifties and twenties”.</span></p>

      Simpson didn’t hear what the man said when he first spoke to her. At her
      request, the man repeated his words and put the newspaper he was carrying
      on the counter. Ms. Simpson took several bills from her cash drawer and
      put them on the newspaper. The man folded the newspaper, turned around
      and walked out of the bank. He walked somewhat more quickly than is the
      custom, but he was not running. She saw nothing unusual in the way in which
      he walked.</span></p>

      appearance. He had reddish or dishwater blonde hair that protruded from
      under the edges of his ball cap and continued about half-way down his neck.
      The man wore a ball cap with an emblem on the front, silver, wraparound

      and shoes. The man was about six feet in height and quite stocky. Ms. Stainge

      in different directions along adjacent streets. The man reached into his
      dark shorts, took out a blue baseball cap and put it on his head. The man,
      who was white-skinned, was carrying what looked like a rolled-up newspaper.
      His hair was thinning on the top of his head and “tuffy” on the sides.

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>According
      to the appellant, the trial judge erred in several respects when he decided
      that similar act evidence principles permitted consideration of the evidence
      on all counts in reaching his decision on each individual count.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      first error, Mr. Strezos says, consists of the trial judge’s finding that
      the similarity among the counts was sufficient to invoke similar act principles.
      The sole issue was identity. The degree of similarity required among the
      offences to negate the improbability of coincidence, best captured by the
      phrase “strikingly similar” or some near equivalent, was not met here.
      The trial judge overestimated the impact of routine, generic similarities
      and failed to appreciate the effect of many dissimilarities that negated
      the degree of similarity required to justify admission.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A
      second error, which Mr. Strezos designates “the <i>Woodcock</i> error”,
      is that, in determining whether the required degree of similarity existed,
      the trial judge took into account evidence that tended to link the appellant
      to the relevant acts. The relevant issue, whether the conduct was sufficiently
      similar to invoke similar act principles, is to be decided wholly on the
      basis of evidence of the <i>manner</i> in which the several crimes were
      committed. Evidence of an accused’s involvement in the allegedly similar
      acts is required to satisfy the requirement of relevance, but has no say
      in the threshold decision about similarity.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For
      the respondent, Mr. Stewart begs to differ. The cumulative effect of the
      several similarities pointed out by the trial judge, topped up with some
      others, was sufficient to satisfy the demanding threshold for evidence
      of similar acts tendered to prove identity. Mr. Stewart points out that
      the bank’s security photographs cannot be excluded from the similar act
      analysis. These photographs imbue acts that may seem generic with the required
      level of specificity or distinctiveness and are evidence of the manner
      in which the offences were committed.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As
      for the assertion that the trial judge misused the evidence linking the
      appellant to the relevant acts, Mr. Stewart responds that the trial judge
      did not misappropriate this evidence to the threshold question of act similarity,
      rather assigned it to its proper place. The line between evidence that
      relates to the manner in which an offence is committed and evidence that
      shows the involvement of an accused is not always easy to draw. The rule
      that requires segregation of the evidence indicative of involvement is
      a general, but not an absolute rule. Decisions about similar acts are context-specific
      and, of necessity, involve consideration of some evidence that serves two
      purposes: to assist in establishing similarity and to aid in providing
      a link to the actor responsible for the acts.</span></p>

      travelled. This consequence is inevitable where admissibility depends on
      weight:  </span><i>Arp</i> at para. 47. The credibility of the evidence

    countervailing consideration, prejudice, includes both “moral prejudice” and “reasoning

    of “bad personhood,” the prospect that the verdict will be based on prejudice
    rather than proof:  <i>Handy </i>at paras. 42, 100 and 139. <i>Reasoning </i>prejudice
    has to do with distraction of the trier of fact, especially a jury, from

    an assessment of prejudice may have an attenuated influence in cases in which

      relevant to the issue of identity on the other counts that disclose the

    remains is the application of the principles that govern the admissibility
    of evidence of similar acts to the circumstances of this case to determine
    whether the trial judge went astray in concluding that the admissibility
    requirements had been satisfied. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    we have already seen, evidence of similar acts is received on the basis of
    an objective improbability of coincidence. The evidence derives its probative
    value from the degree of similarity among the acts under consideration. Where
    the evidence is offered to prove identity, we require a high degree of similarity
    among the acts for the evidence to be admitted. In some cases, the acts display
    a unique trademark or signature that renders them “strikingly similar” and
    satisfies the strict standard for admissibility. In other instances, the
    cumulative effect of a number of significant similarities in the manner in
    which the acts were committed will satisfy the admission requirements.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    gain entry as evidence of similar acts, whether involving extrinsic misconduct
    or conduct that is subject of other counts on the same indictment, the evidence
    of similar acts must be appropriately connected to the facts alleged in an
    individual count. Similarities in character, proximity in time and frequency
    of occurrence are important factors:  <i>Handy</i> at para. 81.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the acts took place over an interval of one month. There were
    four occurrences. Each of the premises was a branch of the same bank, CIBC.
    Each was located in a strip mall, easily accessible from a controlled access
    highway. The bandit directly approached the teller without hesitation and
    demanded money. In three instances, the demand was for larger denomination
    bills. The bandit made no gestures, spoke in a low voice and said nothing
    but the words of demand he uttered. In every instance, the bank had few,
    if any, other customers, a circumstance apparently visible from outside the
    branch by a casual glance through the glass entrance doors and adjacent windows
    of the bank. The four branches are located in reasonable proximity to each
    other, three in

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    a general rule, preliminary findings of fact that are preconditions to the
    admissibility of evidence eschew consideration of the quality or reliability
    of the proposed evidence. After all, weight properly lies within the province
    of the trier of fact not the arbiter of the law. Yet where the touchstone
    of admissibility is probative value, more particularly, its predominance
    over prejudicial effect, some invasion of the province of the trier of fact
    is ineluctable:  <i>Arp</i> at para. 47. In some instances, perhaps more
    in cases where the evidence of similar acts involves extrinsic misconduct
    rather than other counts, there is a controversy about whether the allegedly
    similar acts occurred. Such controversies seem apt to dilute the probative
    value of the evidence and enhance the prejudicial effect of its admission.
    Not so, here. The acts occurred, witness their recording on the banks’ security
    systems. To the extent that the strength of the evidence that the similar
    acts occurred, and in a particular manner, is a factor of influence in the
    assessment of probative value (<i>Handy</i> at paras. 133-134), the inalienable
    record here favours reception.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is worth remembering that the search for similarities in the manner in which
    allegedly similar acts were committed is a question of degree. Like some
    other crimes, bank robbery may not show much diversity or distinctiveness,
    at least in the sense of a trademark or signature. Yet, the authorities allow
    the accumulation of significant similarities to satisfy the threshold for
    admissibility. Often, the probative force of an accumulation of circumstances
    exceeds the sum of its individual parts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Setting
    to one side the potential impact of considering the “linkage” evidence in
    determining the similarity issue, the accumulation of significant similarities
    among the several incidents here is sufficient to establish the objective
    improbability of coincidence. Such dissimilarities as existed among the acts
    were neither so numerous nor substantial to dilute the probative value of
    the acts alleged to be similar. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    potential prejudicial effect of evidence of similar acts includes both moral
    and reasoning prejudice. Moral prejudice, the potential stigma of “bad personhood”,
    refers to the risk of an unfocussed trial and a wrongful conviction, a verdict
    based on prejudice as a surrogate for proof:  <i>Handy</i> at paras. 100
    and 139. Reasoning prejudice has to do with the distraction of the trier
    of fact from properly focussing on the charge(s), aggravated by the consumption
    of time in dealing with a multiplicity of incidents:<i> Handy</i> at para.
    144. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    case involves the invocation of similar act principles across counts in a
    multi-count indictment. The evidence relating to each count is relevant to
    and admissible in proof of the allegation contained in that count. Each incident
    is of equivalent gravity and of minimal inflammatory potential. This is not
    a case, in other words, in which conduct extrinsic to the crimes alleged
    in the indictment is enlisted as evidence of similar acts to prove what is
    alleged, and lugs with it inflammatory claims of greater gravity or moral
    depravity.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    large measure, the practical realities of a trial by judge sitting alone
    in a case in which the allegedly similar acts do not extend beyond the counts
    of a multi-count indictment reduce significantly, if not to the vanishing
    point, the virus of reasoning prejudice. The judge is less likely than a
    jury to be distracted by a focus on similar acts. No additional time is required
    to adduce the evidence of similar acts because they are co-extensive with
    the evidence that is relevant, material and properly admissible on the individual
    counts. The only additional time required is that needed for the argument
    on admissibility at the end of the trial. The conduct relied upon as evidence
    of similar acts was <i>not</i> contested, although the appellant’s participation
    and the legal characterization of the crimes committed were controversial. </p>

    required for evidence of similar acts offered to establish the identity of
    the perpetrator of the several offences charged. The offences contained a
    number of significant similarities which, taken together, warrant admission.
    The dissimilarities among the four incidents were neither so many nor so
    substantial to diminish the probative value of the evidence to the point
    of its domination by prejudice. Such dissimilarities as there may have been
    did not compound confusion and distraction, thus aggravate prejudice.</p>

      s. 343(a) anyone who steals, and in order to extort what is stolen or to
      prevent or overcome resistance to the theft, uses threats of violence to
      a person or property commits robbery. A threat of violence may be express,
      or implied from words or conduct, or from both words and conduct. All the
      circumstances require consideration:  <i>R. v. Sayers and McCoy</i> (1983),

    ground resonates with the sound of a claim that the finding of “threats of
    violence” was unreasonable. In my view, it was not. A bank. A direct approach
    to a teller. A demand for money, not a withdrawal slip or any other typical
    banking document. Conduct designed to intimidate and to instil a sense of
    fear in its recipient and to ensure compliance with its demand. Such a crime
    is robbery, not theft.</p>
