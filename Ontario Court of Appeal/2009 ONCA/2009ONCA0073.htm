    been set up by conservation officers on the east side of the road as part
    of an enforcement operation to catch illegal hunters.  </p>

    Yapput shone the spotlight out of the driver’s window illuminating the decoy.  The

    on
    <st1:Street w:st="on">

    on those rights – one relating to government regulation and the other relating

    as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>And His Majesty

    Magiskan explained there were a number of reasons why moose moved more frequently
    during night hours and were thus considerably easier to locate.  The reasons
    included the amount of human traffic during the daytime, the fact that moose
    feed at night, and the beginning of the rutting season in September and early
    October.  Mr. Magiskan considered that night hunting was preferable to day
    hunting.  He explained that his father had hunted at night and knew where
    the moose came to feed in the rivers at night.  </p>

    reasons.  The first was released on April 27, 2001.  In those reasons, the
    justice of the peace dealt first with the charge against Jacob under s. 17(1)(e)
    of the <i>FWCA</i> of shooting across a public roadway.  He found that
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Greta Road is “a right of way for public vehicular traffic” within the meaning
    of s. 17(1)(e).  He held that Greta Road constituted “lands taken up” within
    the meaning of Treaty 9 and that, as such, Greta Road is not a location from
    which the appellants may claim a treaty right to hunt.  On the basis of this
    reasoning, he convicted Jacob of the charge.</p>

    response, the Crown argues that the purpose of the subsection is to protect
    the public.  Thus, the subsection is aimed at prohibiting discharging firearms
    in or across places where the public drives vehicles.  The requirement that
    there be a “right of way” for public use does not refer to a formal or legal
    grant of a right of way to the public.  Rather, the requirement is focused
    on the public’s actual use of the land in question.  The subsection applies
    if it can be shown that the public uses the land with the permission of the
    person who controls its use whether that person is a government authority,
    private individual or company.</p>

    21(1)(c) did not require that the land on which the public travelled be dedicated
    by government or even intended for public travel.  Nor did it require that
    there be a legal grant authorizing the use by the public.  Use by the public,
    nothing more, was sufficient to attract the protection afforded by the subsection.  In
    addition, the wording of s. 21(1)(c) was sufficiently broad to include a
    privately owned or privately maintained roadway if it was used by the public.  Some
    of the roadways listed (e.g. driveways, squares and places) could be owned

    that are used or intended for use by the public.  It is self evident that
    discharging a firearm from or across such a thoroughfare could constitute
    a serious risk to public safety.  Undoubtedly, the subsection was aimed in
    part at least at protecting against such a risk.</p>

    not
    “substantial” so as to suggest a change in the content of the law.  It seems
    to me that the use of the new phrase
    “a right of way for public vehicular traffic” is consistent with an effort
    to improve the formulation of the subsection, not change its intent.  It
    simplifies the list of potential thoroughfares to which the subsection applies
    and removes the possibility that the previous list was not sufficiently inclusive.  Moreover,
    there is nothing in the Hansard Debates leading up to the enactment of the
    current provision to suggest that the revision in the wording of the subsection
    was intended to bring about substantial change.  I would be hesitant to read
    into the new subsection an intention to narrow the public safety protection

line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    view is consistent with the third prong of the statutory interpretation test,
    the purpose of the provision.  One of the purposes of s. 17(1)(e) is to protect
    the public who is travelling in vehicles from the dangers arising from the
    discharge of firearms.  David Ramsay, MPP, Timiskaming-Cochrane, described
    one of the purposes behind the <i>FWCA</i> as follows:  “Safety in methods:  It
    refers to things like unsafe areas for hunting and hunter clothing and the
    careless use of firearms and new penalties for that, which is very important,
    bringing that up to today; ways that I suppose in the old days we used to
    accept in hunting animals”: see Ontario, Legislative Assembly, <i>Official
    Report of Debates (Hansard)</i>, No. 257b (08 December 1997) at p. 13653
    (David Ramsay).  It would be inconsistent with this purpose to interpret
    s. 17(1)(e) as excluding some roadways on which the public lawfully travels,
    because of the nature of the underlying authority permitting the travel.  The
    purpose of the provision is to prohibit discharging a firearm across lands
    over which the public drives vehicles with permission.  That purpose can
    best be achieved by interpreting the phrase “a right of way for public vehicular
    traffic” broadly so as to protect the members of the public driving on all
    lands that are open to public use in vehicles.  </p>

    pursuant to which Kimberly Clark uses and maintains

    Greta Road is a well established and maintained road.  It has been in use

      the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. Badger</i>, [1996]

      it was put to a visible use that was incompatible with hunting.  Turning
      to the case law, it is clear that the courts have also accepted this interpretation
