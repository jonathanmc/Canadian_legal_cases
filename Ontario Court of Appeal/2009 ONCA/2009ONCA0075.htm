  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>This
    is an appeal from the judgment dated March 19, 2008 where it was declared
    that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i)  the Residual Value Charge imposed upon
    Boniferro by Her Majesty the Queen purportedly under the authority of the <i>Crown
    Forest Sustainability Act</i>, 1994, S.O. 1994, c. 25 is a tax for which
    there is no lawful authority to impose and collect;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii) Boniferro is entitled to an accounting
    by Her Majesty the Queen of all RVCs paid by Boniferro since March 13, 2003;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iii)     Boniferro is entitled to a refund of
    all RVCs it paid to Her Majesty the Queen since March 13, 2003 with interest
    thereon in accordance with the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i> and the <i>Courts
    of Justice Act</i>;</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><u><span lang=EN-US>OVERVIEW</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The
    respondent, Boniferro Mill Works ULC (Boniferro) acquires timber, owned by
    the Crown, and which it harvests from Crown land pursuant to a licence granted
    to it under the <i>Crown Forest Sustainability Act</i> (<i>CFSA</i>). For
    this privilege it pays certain fees to the Crown. Those fees include:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) Forest Renewal Charge pursuant to s.
    49 of the Act;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b) The Forestry Futures Charge pursuant
    to s. 51(5) of the Act; and,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(c) The price for the timber consisting of
    two components:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i)  the minimum value component;
    and,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii) the residual value component.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The
    respondent argued and the application judge accepted, that a portion of these
    charges (the “Residual Value Component” or
    “RVC”) was a tax for which there was no lawful authority.
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario appeals from that judgment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The
    Crown asserts that the RVC forms part of the price paid by purchasers of
    Crown timber and which the respondent agreed to pay. The Crown, when disposing
    of its property, is in no different a position than any other property owner.
    It may choose whether to sell its property, and may set the price for such
    a sale as it sees fit. There is no entitlement to purchase Crown timber.
    The charge at issue is only paid by those who choose to purchase Crown timber.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The
    respondent argues that in pith and substance, when the legislative structure
    and machinery are properly examined against the background of legislative
    history and jurisprudence, as they were by the application judge, the RVC
    is seen to have the hallmarks and characteristics of a tax as opposed to
    a price.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><u><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The
    respondent operates a hardwood sawmill in Sault Ste. Marie,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario. It harvests timber and produces forest products, which are sold
    to end users for manufacture into hardwood flooring, kitchen cabinets, furniture,
    pallets, boxes and musical instruments.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Boniferro
    acquired the sawmill on March 13, 2003 and at the same time acquired shares
    in the capital stock of Clergue Forest Management Inc. (“Clergue”). Clergue
    holds a licence, a Sustainable Forest Licence (SFL) for the Algoma Forest
    Management Unit on behalf of Boniferro and five other partner companies.
    Crown forest resources are sold only to persons who are licensed to harvest
    forest resources pursuant to a SFL.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Clergue
    harvests timber pursuant to its SFL and provides a supply of forest resources
    to the partner companies. Clergue is the respondent’s main supplier of harvested
    timber. The respondent reimburses Clergue for all charges levied by the Minister
    against Clergue as part of the licensing regime under the <i>CFSA</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Clergue
    was issued Sustainable Forest Licence Number 542257 approved by Order-in-Council
    No. 2242/97 dated December 10, 1997 which permitted it to harvest all species
    of timber in the Licence Area (as specified in the licence) in the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Algoma
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Forest. The terms and conditions of the licence are set out in that document
    and include:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2.2<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span>The
    Company shall pay area charges and forestry future charges in accordance
    with sections 32(1) and 51(5) of the <i>Crown Forest Sustainability Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2.4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The
    Company shall pay the prices determined by the Minister under section 31
    of the <i>Crown Forest Sustainability Act</i> for forest resources harvested
    under this licence.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>10.1<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The
    Company shall be involved by the Crown for the forest renewal charge to be
    paid by the licensee pursuant to the <i>Crown Forest Sustainability Act</i>.
    The Company shall pay the forest renewal charge to the trust.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The
    licence was for a term of twenty years commencing April 1, 2002 subject to
    review by the Minister every five years to ensure compliance with the terms
    and conditions of the licence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Section
    31 of the <i>CFSA</i> provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Minister may determine from time to time the
    prices at which forest resources may be harvested or used for a designated
    purpose under a forest resource licence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>and s. 40 requires that
    Crown charges in relation to forest resources, authorized to be harvested
    pursuant to a SFL, shall be paid by the licensee whether the resources are
    harvested by the licensee or someone else with or without the licensee’s
    consent. Crown charges are defined in s. 3 of the Act to include all prices,
    charges, fees, penalties, costs, expenses, interest and fines. Section 33
    of the Act provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Property in forest resources that may be harvested
    under a forest resource licence remains in the Crown until all Crown charges
    have been paid in respect of the resources.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>All
    licensees are required by the <i>CFSA</i> to pay the following charges:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>49(1)  The holder of a forest resource licence
    shall pay forest renewal charges to the Minister of Finance in the amounts
    and within the times required by the Minister of Natural Resources.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>51(5)  The holder of a forest resource licence
    shall pay forestry futures charges to the Trust in the amounts and within
    the times required by the Minister.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>and in addition to these
    sums “the price” for timber pursuant to s. 31 of the Act quoted above.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>At
    all relevant times “the price” included two components described in the Crown’s
    factum as:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The minimum value component, which is usually set
    annually and is an amount per cubic metre of timber. The minimum value component
    ensures a minimum level of revenue from the sale of the timber. The amount
    varies between species or species group and the type of mill to which the
    timber is delivered.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The residual value component, which is an amount
    per cubic metre of timber that is determined on a monthly basis. Like the
    minimum value, the residual value is a component of the price for timber
    pursuant to section 31 of the Act.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The
    RVC permits the Crown to set a price for its timber that takes into account
    a strong market for its product. The RVC may be charged when the net price
    deemed to be received by a category of mill for representative product exceeds
    a certain threshold amount. As the market price for the product increases
    beyond the threshold amount, the RVC amount increases each month. Similarly,
    when the market price for representative product decreases, the RVC amount
    decreases each month. When the market price is below the set threshold amount,
    the RVC is zero.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The
    RVC varies by species/species group, category or grade and the type of mill
    where the timber is processed. The RVC calculation attempts to assign a value
    to the timber harvested from Crown lands that reflects current market conditions.
    For example, timber of the same specie and grade going to the same types
    of but different mills will bear the same RVC –
    irrespective of the profit or indeed lack thereof of the individual mills.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><u><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The
    Crown submits that the application judge fundamentally erred in failing to
    undertake any analysis in relation to its position that the RVC was simply
    a component of the price charged for the sale of Crown resources. The Crown
    says the application judge embarked on an analysis comparing regulatory charges
    to taxes in circumstances here, where the Crown never argued that the RVC
    was a regulatory charge. The Crown’s position has always been that this is
    a case of proprietary rights where the government as a property owner is
    dealing with its property as an owner and setting a price for the sale of
    its resources.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It
    appears from his reasons that the application judge understood the Crown’s
    position. At paragraph 51 of his reasons he says:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[51]     It says that, as such, the price which
    it sets as property owner in selling its resources to a purchaser such as
    Boniferro are charges entirely distinct from a tax or a regulatory charge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>However,
    after examining the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Canadian
    Industrial Gas &amp; Oil Ltd. v. Government of Saskatchewan</i>, [1978] 2
    S.C.R. 545 (<i>CIGOL</i>) and noting the differences between that case and
    the one before him, he went on to note the two similarities between the RVC
    and the royalty surcharge which was the subject of the <i>CIGOL</i> case:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>•     that the RVC proceeds are paid into the provincial consolidated revenue
    fund; and,</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>•     the legislation provides for significant remedies to the
    government for collection over and above a private lessor-lessee relationship.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In <i>CIGOL</i> the
    court was concerned with a royalty surcharge, imposed not only on those producers
    who had existing leases with the Crown but also on those who were producing
    on private lands and whose rights in that regard were expropriated by the
    same legislation. The royalty surcharge did not take a share of the producer’s
    profits but one hundred percent of them and was mandatory regardless of actual
    production or profit level.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>… any person who is producing oil from lands in
    respect of which the Crown has expropriated the oil and gas rights has no
    right to elect not to produce oil which would become liable for payment of
    the royalty surcharge. He is compelled, by the imposition of a heavy penalty
    imposed for failure to comply, to continue the production of oil.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>It
    is of note that in <i>CIGOL</i> there was never any doubt about the validity
    of the traditional royalties levied. The court differentiated between the “royalty
    surcharge”
    and the existing royalties which were described as “genuine”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The
    application judge thereafter considered the analysis in three cases<a href="#_ftn2"
name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a> – all of which addressed the distinction between
    regulatory charges and taxes. In applying the test set out in those cases
    to the facts before him, he erred. The only issue he ought to have considered
    was whether, as owner of the land and timber in question,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario was entitled to set the price as it did.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Instead
    the application judge applied the <i>Eurig<a
href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><b><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[3]</span></b></span></span></a> </i>analysis to the case before him. This
    analysis was succinctly set out at paragraph 15 in <i>Eurig</i> as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Whether a levy is a tax or a fee was considered
    in <i>Lawson</i>, <i>supra</i>. Duff J. for the majority concluded that the
    levy in question was a tax because it was: (1) enforceable by law; (2) imposed
    under the authority of the legislature; (3) levied by a public body; and
    (4) intended for a public purpose.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Using that analysis, the
    application judge concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[78]     …
    that the RVC is enforceable by law. The sections of the <i>Crown Forest Sustainability
    Act</i> which I have quoted above provide broad enforcement measures, some
    of which have in fact been applied against Boniferro. The enforcement powers
    of the respondent reach far beyond those of a property owner and are specifically
    provided for in the legislation. Furthermore, payment of the RVC is compulsory
    in the same sense as the GST, for example.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[79]     I further find that the RVC is purported
    to be imposed under the authority of the legislature, and in particular,
    section 31 of the <i>Crown Forest Sustainability Act</i>. The enforcement
    provisions of the Act relate to “Crown charges” which are all prices, charges,
    fees, penalties, costs, expenses, interest and fines imposed under this Act
    or under a Forest Resource Licence. The Forest Resource Licence is a licence
    granted under the Act. Although the licence itself contains Section 2.4,
    whereby,</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>2.4 The company shall pay the prices
    determined by the Minister under Section 31 of the <i>Crown Forest Sustainability
    Act</i> for forest resources harvested under this licence. That section,
    in my view, does not stand alone as a term between a lessor and lessee, but
    rather, is in fact a term “imposed under the authority of the Legislature.”</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I find that the true purported authority for the
    RVC is section 31 of the Act, not the licence alone.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[80]     The RVC clearly is levied by a public
    body.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[81]     Furthermore, the RVC, unlike the other
    two trust provisions provided for in the <i>Crown Forest Sustainability Act</i>,
    is intended for a public purpose being entirely deposited into the general
    consolidated revenue fund for the province. Indeed the Crown concedes this
    point.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[82]     The court, in <i>Eurig</i>, also considered </p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>another factor that generally distinguishes
    a fee from a tax is that a nexus must exist between the quantum charged and
    the cost of the service provided in order for a levy to be considered constitutionally
    valid. (p. 11)</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[83]     There is no evidence whatsoever of any
    such nexus in relation to the RVC.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[84]     Justice Major, for the court, stated at
    para. 22,</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>The evidence in this appeal fails to disclose
    any correlation between the amount charged for grants of letters probate
    and the cost of providing that service. The Agreed Statement of Fact clearly
    shows that the procedures involved in granting letters probate do not vary
    with the value of the estate. Although the cost of granting letters probate
    bears no relation to the value of an estate, the probate levy varies directly
    with the value of the estate. The result is the absence of a nexus between
    the levy and the cost of the service which indicates that the levy is a tax
    and not a fee.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[85]     On the basis of the foregoing analysis,
    I conclude that the Residual Value Charge is in fact a tax. It is in stark
    contrast to the Residual Value Rate which the Regulation to the Crown Timber
    Act authorized as one element of Crown charges and which was specifically
    identified in the Schedule 1.1 to the Regulations. It has no relationship
    to a regulatory scheme and bears no nexus to any cost of delivery of services
    by the Respondent. It clearly fits the criteria set out in the <i>Lawson</i> case
    for determination of whether a levy is a fee or a tax. The RVC was not arrived
    at by a process of negotiation between free wills resulting in a meeting
    of minds, rather it is an obligation imposed by the Respondent. As such,
    in my view, it is an obligation that arises at law and not pursuant to contract.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He
    then went on to consider whether there was express legislative authority
    to authorize the imposition of a tax and concluded that s. 31 of the Act
    does not authorize the imposition of a tax. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In
    his analysis, the application judge placed great reliance on the differences
    between the Act and the <i>Crown Timber Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. 51 which
    preceded it. He noted that the former Act provided for a Forest Renewal Trust
    and a Forest Futures Trust similar to the charges found in the Act.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He
    also noted what he described as the “marked contrast” between s. 31 of the
    Act and s. 51 of the former Act that provided:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>51.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;</span>Unless
    otherwise provided in the Regulations, the Crown dues to be paid in respect
    of timber by a licensee or class of licensee are those Crown dues fixed or
    determined under the Regulations in force at the time the timber is measured,
    even if the timber is cut before the Regulations come into force.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>He
    noted that the Residual Value Rate was specifically referenced by name in
    the Regulations and was a fixed amount and placed reliance on that fact in
    concluding: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>… there is no legislative authority authorizing
    the Residual Value Charge tax.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>There
    can be no doubt that proprietary charges are different from regulatory charges
    or taxes. In <i>620 Connaught Ltd. v.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    (Attorney General)</i>, [2008] S.C.C. 7 at para. 49, Rothstein J. observed:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I agree that proprietary charges for goods and
    services supplied in a commercial context are distinct from either regulatory
    charges or taxes and may be determined by market forces. As explained by
    Professor Hogg in <i>Constitutional Law of Canada</i> (5<sup>th</sup> ed.
    2007) at pp. 870-71:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>[Proprietary charges] are those levied by a
    province in the exercise of proprietary rights over its public property.
    Thus, a province may levy charges in the form of licence fees, rents or royalties
    as the price for the private exploitation of provincially-owned natural resources;
    and a province may charge for the sales of books, liquor, electricity, rail
    travel or other goods or services which it supplies in a commercial way.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In <i>620
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    Connaught</i>, the government did not argue that the licence fees that were
    the subject of that case were proprietary charges. The case instead was concerned
    with whether the charges were of a regulatory nature or a tax.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>A
    necessary and important distinction is to be made between a province’s broad
    power to control the use and exploitation of natural resources located on
    lands owned by the Crown and the power possessed by the Crown as a legislative
    authority which power is limited by the <i>Constitution</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>As
    Professor Hogg has noted:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The exploitation of a provincially-owned resource
    can be controlled by the province, either by the province directly producing
    and selling the resource, or by the province granting permits, leases or
    licences that authorize private firms to produce and sell the resource. Obviously,
    the rate of production, the degree of processing within the province and
    (subject to market conditions) the price at which it is to be sold can be
    controlled by the province as proprietor … </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A province can profit from the exploitation of
    provincially-owned resources in a variety of ways: by direct sales or by
    licence fees, rents or royalties.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Peter W. Hogg <i>Constitutional Law of

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>When
    the Crown is disposing of its own property, it is not bound by limits on
    its legislative authority. The use and disposition of Crown timber is a common
    example of the authority of the Crown to dispose of its property as it sees
    fit. Professor Hogg notes at pp. 30-10-30-11:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Most forest lands are owned by the provinces … In
    each province, the provincially owned forests are not only subject to provincial
    legislative power under s. 92(5) and s. 92A, they are also subject to provincial
    executive power as proprietor: the province enjoys the same powers of disposition
    and management as a private proprietor. The provincially-owned forests are
    in fact harvested by private firms to whom the provincial Crown issues licences
    to cut timber. The process is controlled by the province through conditions
    attached to the licences …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The province can derive revenue from the production
    of timber on its own lands through sales of timber, rents, licence fees and
    stumpage fees (which are like royalties). When imposed as a proprietor, these
    charges are valid, even if they would be invalid if levied by legislation
    as taxes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>As
    the Crown has noted in paragraph 34 of its factum:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The difference between a proprietary charge and
    a tax can be illustrated in this case by the different treatment accorded
    Crown and private timber, harvested by the same company and milled at the
    same sawmill. Under the Act, the harvester of Crown wood must pay all of
    the charges discussed above. However, the harvester of private wood is liable
    to pay none of these charges – that harvester must pay whatever fees are
    agreed to with the owner of the private land.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In
    CIGOL the invalid royalty surcharge was held to be a tax because:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>1.   It impacted on those who had no contractual relationship with
    the Crown.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>2.   The obligation to pay the surcharge arose pursuant to legislation
    and not by contract.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>3.   The legislation compelled producers to continue producing
    oil or pay a significant fine if they refused.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>4.   The surcharge was levied on the share of production to which,
    by the terms of the lease, the lessee was entitled to keep.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>None
    of these factors are present in this case. Here, only those who purchase
    timber from the Crown are required to pay the charge as part of the price
    for the timber. The obligation to pay what amounts to a variable royalty
    is clearly set out in the licence granted to the licensee in addition to
    s. 31 of the Act. There is no obligation on anyone to purchase Crown timber.
    Mills are free to acquire timber from private sources in which event there
    is no obligation to pay anything to the Minister. Finally, the RVC allows
    the Crown to share in the profits when the market is strong. At the risk
    of repetition, in relation to the latter point, the Supreme Court of Canada
    has said that proprietary charges may be determined by market forces, see <i>620
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Connaught</i>, <i>supra</i> at paragraph 49.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In
    concluding that the RVC was a tax, the application judge relied on <i>Lawson
    v. Interior Tree Fruit and Vegetable Committee</i>, [1931] 2 D.L.R. 193,
    wherein the Supreme Court of Canada defined the classic elements of a tax
    to be:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>1)  Is the levy enforceable by law?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>2)  Is the levy imposed under the authority of the legislature?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>3)  Is the levy imposed by a public body?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>4)  Is the levy imposed for a public purpose?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The
    application judge concluded that the RVC met all four criteria and therefore
    was a tax. However, as the Supreme Court of
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    noted in <i>620
    <st1:place w:st="on">

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>these characters will likely apply to most government
    levies.</p>

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    British Columbia</i>, [1985] B.C.J. No. 3015 (S.C.) Spencer J. at para. 7,
    commenting on the CIGOL decision which relied on the <i>Lawson</i> case definition
    of the four classic elements of tax, stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>… It was enforceable by law, it was imposed under
    the authority of the Legislature, it was imposed by a public body, and it
    was made for a public purpose. With great respect, although that case is
    authority for the proposition that an impost cannot be a tax unless it meets
    those criteria, I do not think the converse necessarily follows, that anything
    meeting those four criteria must be a tax. I do not of course dispute the
    ruling in that case that the royalty surcharge was a tax, but those four
    tests would apply to a ferry fare in British Columbia, although in my opinion
    that fare is not a tax but a fee for service imposed under statutory authority.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>I agree with and accept
    his reasoning. Although the levy may meet the four <i>Lawson</i> criteria,
    that alone is not sufficient to make the levy a tax.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In
    my view, it is clear from all of the above that the RVC was merely part of
    the purchase cost of timber from the Crown. There was no obligation imposed
    on anyone to purchase timber from the Crown but if and when they did, it
    was clear from both the Act and the terms of their licence from the Crown
    that the price of that timber would vary according to market conditions and
    would be set by the Minister. In my view the RVC is not a tax and accordingly
    the judgment declaring it to be such must be set aside.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><u><span lang=EN-US>LIMITATION DEFENCE</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In
    view of my conclusion that the RVC is not a tax but rather a valid part of
    the purchase price of timber, it follows that the respondent is not entitled
    to any refund of money paid to the Crown as RVC. It is therefore unnecessary
    to determine the second ground of appeal which relates to the limitation
    period, but I do so in the event this case goes further.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The
    Crown says the application judge made two errors when he concluded 1) that
    the limitation period began to run from the date that the respondent first
    paid RVC and 2) that the relevant limitation period is six years.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The
    Crown says the cause of action must be said to be complete when each payment
    was made in essence, a separate and distinct cause of action for each payment
    made. The effect causes two limitation periods to be relevant: s. 4 of the <i>Limitations
    Act</i>, 2002, which provides a two-year limitation for the commencement
    of claims from the time a claim is discovered as well as the former <i>Limitations
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. L-15, which provides for a six-year period after
    the cause of action arose.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The
    Crown says the new Act applies to all causes of action discovered after January
    1, 2004 and therefore the respondent would only be entitled to repayment
    from two years before the Notice of Application was filed, August 20, 2007.
    (The Crown’s factum at para. 59 erroneously states that the Notice of Application
    was filed August 20, 2005).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The
    old Act applies for claims based on acts or omissions that took place before
    January 1, 2004 and for this case that period is six years. Therefore, the
    Crown argues,  payments made to December 31, 2003 are recoverable but those
    made after January 1, 2004 to August 20, 2005 are statute barred because
    only those payments made in the two years prior to the issuance of the Notice
    of Application are recoverable i.e., in the period from August 20, 2005 to
    August 20, 2007, the latter being the date the Notice of Application was
    filed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The
    Crown relies on the transition provision contained in the new Act. Section
    24(5) of the new Act provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>24(5)  If the former limitation period did not
    expire before the effective date and if a limitation period under the Act
    would apply were the claim based on an act or omission that took place on
    or after the effective date, the following rules apply:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1. If the claim was not discovered before
    the effective date, this Act applies as if the Act or omission had taken
    place on the effective date.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2.   If the claim was discovered before the
    effective date, the former limitation period applies.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Section
    24(1) defines “effective date” to mean the date on which the new Act came
    into force, which was January 1, 2004. The difficulty here lies in the fact
    that James P. Boniferro, president and CEO of the respondent, in paragraph 10 of his affidavit sworn 20 August 2007, states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>10. Until we at Boniferro realized in early
    summer, 2007 that the RVC was an unauthorized tax rather than simply a component
    price of Crown timber we had been disputing with the Minister the level at
    which the RVC was being charged.</p>

      24(2) of the new Act provides:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>This section applies to claims
      based on acts or omissions that took place before the effective date and

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      claim for the payments made before January 1, 2004 falls within section
      24(2). They are claims based on acts or omissions that took place before
      the effective date and in respect of which no proceeding was commenced
      before the effective date. Once Section 24(2) of the new Act is met the
      consequence is that the transition provisions of this section apply.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      former limitation period under the old Act was six years and had not expired
      before January 1, 2004 (the claims began March, 2003) and hence s. 24(3)
      is of no application.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Similarly
      s. 24(4) does not apply to the facts of this case. While the former limitation
      period did not expire before the effective date, a limitation period under
      the new Act would apply were the claim based on an act or omission that
      took place on or after the effective date (January 1, 2004).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>This
      brings us to s. 24(5), which I will repeat for ease of reference:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(5) If the former limitation period did not
    expire before the effective date and if a limitation period under the Act
    would apply were the claim based on an act or omission that took place on
    or after the effective date, the following rules apply:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.  If the claim was not discovered before
    the effective date, this Act applies as if the act or omission had taken
    place on the effective date.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote> 2.   If the claim was discovered
    before the effective date, the former limitation
    period applies.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      my view, the facts of this case meet the requirements of s. 24(5)(1) of
      the new Act. The former limitation period (6 years) did not expire before
      the effective date (January 1, 2004) and a limitation period under the
      new Act would apply if the claim were based on an act or omission that
      took place on or after the effective date; the claim was not discovered
      before the effective date accordingly – the new Act applies as if the act
      or omission had taken place on the effective date, January 1, 2004.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span><span lang=EN-US>Consequently,
      the claims in relation to the payments made before January 1, 2004 are
      for the purpose of the new Act treated as though they had been made on
      January 1, 2004. The tolling of the limitation period in relation to those
      claims, however, does not begin until the claims are discovered which,
      here was August, 2007 as it was for the claims in relation to the payments
      made after January 1, 2004.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>In
    these circumstances had Boniferro succeeded it could have claimed in respect
    of all payments made from March, 2003 to January 1, 2004 (all deemed to have
    occurred January 1, 2004 by Section 24(5) (1) and subject to a two year limitation
    from the discovery of the claim) and those from January 1, 2004 forward,
    on the basis of Section 4.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>However,
    having found that the RVC is a legitimate component of the price of timber
    and a proprietary charge within the competence of the Crown it does not matter
    in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>For
    these reasons I would allow the appeal and set aside the judgment of Tranmer
    J. dated January 21, 2008 and in its place I would order that the application
    be dismissed with costs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>If
    the parties are unable to agree on costs the Crown may file brief written
    submissions within 15 days of the release of these reasons and the respondent
    may file responding submissions within 15 days thereafter.</p>
