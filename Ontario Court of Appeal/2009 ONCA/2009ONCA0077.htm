  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
style='text-transform:uppercase'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    subject of this appeal is a cottage property.  The central issue in this
    case is whether the Superior Court had jurisdiction to entertain the action
    brought by the appellants for damages and other relief or whether the Landlord
    and Tenant Board had exclusive jurisdiction under the <i>Residential Tenancies
    Act, 2006</i>, S.O. 2006, c. 17 (“<i>RTA</i>”).  A subsidiary issue is whether,
    even if the Superior Court had jurisdiction, the appellants ought to be allowed
    to argue the applicability of the <i>RTA </i>on appeal.  <u></u></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant Cyril Kaiman married Diamond in 1978.  They had one child, the
    appellant Benyemina. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Shortly
    after Cyril and Diamond married, they began to vacation at a cottage property
    owned by Diamond’s father, Harvey Leonard Graham (“H.A.”).  In 1979, Cyril
    proposed an improvement to the cottage to H.A.  The appellants say that H.A.
    agreed to the improvements and verbally agreed to give Cyril a 100 year lease.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    September 1, 1982, H.A. and his wife Frances Edna Graham (“
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Frances</st1:country-region>
    ”) entered into a lease with Diamond (and Diamond only) in respect of the
    cottage.  The lease was for a term of 40 years.  It contained a termination
    clause stating that notwithstanding the 40 year term, the lease shall expire
    upon the death of H.A. and the happening of one of three events: (i)
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">France</st1:country-region>
    ’s death; (ii)
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">France</st1:country-region>
    ’s remarriage; or (iii) written notice by
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Frances</st1:country-region>
    that she no longer wishes to use the cottage property. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants say that both Cyril and Diamond continued to negotiate with H.A.
    for a 100 year lease and to include provision for any children of the marriage
    in the lease.  Revised leases were prepared but never executed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    August 18, 1999, H.A. transferred the entire property to his son, the respondent
    Douglas.  Shortly thereafter, Diamond passed away.  H.A. passed away two
    years later.  Since Diamond’s death, the appellants say that they have been
    denied use and enjoyment of the cottage property. 
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place

    provided written notice trigging termination of the lease in January 2005. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
style='text-transform:uppercase'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    trial, the appellants sought the following relief: a declaration that they
    had an equitable interest in the cottage property; rectification of the written
    lease agreement to extend the term to 100 years; and a declaration that an
    unsigned written lease was valid and subsisting.  They also sought damages
    in the amount of $250,000 on account of the improvements to the cottage on
    the basis of <i>quantum meruit</i> and unjust enrichment.<b><u></u></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
style='text-transform:uppercase'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    appeal, the appellants do not attack the basis of the trial judge’s decision.  They
    submit that the trial judge lacked jurisdiction to hear the claim they brought
    because the <i>RTA</i> applies to the cottage and the Landlord and Tenant
    Board had exclusive jurisdiction to deal with the matters in issue.  The
    appellants submit that, as a result, the judgment of the Superior Court judge
    is a nullity and ought to be quashed.  They also argue that they are tenants
    as “heirs” of Diamond pursuant to s. 2 of the <i>RTA </i>and that the lease
    termination clause is void since it is an agreement to terminate a lease
    entered into at the time of the tenancy, contrary to s. 37(5)(a).  <b><u></u></b></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h3>1.         <i>Did the Superior Court have jurisdiction to hear the case
      presented before it?</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    stated above, the appellants neither pleaded nor raised the <i>RTA </i>at
    trial.  The question is thus whether the appellants should be allowed to
    rely on it for the first time on appeal.  Since the appellants’ argument
    goes to the jurisdiction of the Superior Court, it may be raised for the
    first time on appeal: see <i>W.(V.) v. S.(D.)</i>, [1996] 2 S.C.R. 108, at
    para. 17.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the matter is by no means free from contention, for the purposes of determining
    the jurisdictional issue, I am prepared to assume that the <i>RTA </i>applied
    to the cottage property in issue.  It is clear, however, that the Superior
    Court had jurisdiction to hear the case presented before it and that the
    matters in issue at trial did not fall within the exclusive jurisdiction
    of the Landlord and Tenant Board.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Contrary
    to the appellants’ submission, the central issue at trial was <i>not</i> the
    interpretation and applicability of a lease governed by the <i>RTA</i>.  Rather,
    as discussed above, the issues at trial concerned the extension of the lease
    based on an alleged oral promise and compensation for improvements based
    on unjust enrichment or <i>quantum meruit</i>.  The Superior Court undoubtedly
    had jurisdiction over this subject matter and the subject matter contained
    in the statement of claim.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants have framed the issue on appeal as being whether a declaration
    terminating their tenancy should be granted.  They submit that the Landlord
    and Tenant Board has exclusive jurisdiction to decide this issue: see generally,
    Part V of the <i>RTA </i>and s. 168(2).  However, their statement of claim
    does not contain a request for a declaration terminating a tenancy.  It requests
    a declaration that a tenancy exists.  The <i>RTA </i>does not confer jurisdiction
    on the Tribunal to determine whether there is a valid tenancy agreement.  The
    existence of a tenancy agreement is presumed: <i>O’Brien v. 718458 Ontario
    Inc. </i>(1999), 25 R.P.R. (3d) 57 (Ont. Gen. Div.).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore,
    in their statement of claim, the appellants sought numerous grounds of relief,
    including equitable relief and a certificate of pending litigation, which
    the Landlord and Tenant Board would have had no jurisdiction to order.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    any event, even if the Board had jurisdiction to determine whether the tenancy
    was validly terminated,<i> </i>having regard to the appellants’ claim for
    damages in the amount of $250,000, the appellants were entitled to commence
    their proceeding in the Superior Court.  Having done so, that court had all
    the jurisdiction that the Board would have had.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    207(1) of the <i>RTA </i>states that the Board, where it otherwise has jurisdiction,
    may order the payment of the greater of $10,000 and the jurisdiction of Small
    Claims Court.  Section 207(2) states:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A person entitled to apply under this Act but whose
    claim exceeds the Board’s monetary jurisdiction may commence a proceeding
    in any court of competent jurisdiction for an order requiring the payment
    of that sum and, if such a proceeding is commenced, the court may exercise
    any powers that the Board could have exercised if the proceeding had been
    before the Board and within its monetary jurisdiction.  </p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>Simply put, the Superior Court had
    jurisdiction to grant any and all of the relief claimed by the appellants.  The
    Board did not.  Any jurisdiction it did have was, by virtue of s. 207(2),
    non-exclusive.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I would dismiss the appellants’ submission that the Superior Court lacked
    jurisdiction to try the case. </p>
  <h3>2.<i>         Although the Superior Court had jurisdiction, should the
      appellants’ argument respecting the RTA be entertained on appeal? </i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants rely on s. 3 of the <i>RTA</i> which states that the Act<i> </i>applies “with
    respect to rental units in residential complexes, despite any other Act and
    despite any agreement or waiver to the contrary”.  They argue that the exception
    in s. 5(a) of the Act does not apply.  That section provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>5.  This Act does not apply with respect to,</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a) living accommodation intended to be provided
    to the travelling or vacationing public or occupied for a seasonal or temporary
    period in a hotel, motel or motor hotel, resort, lodge, tourist camp, cottage
    or cabin establishment, inn, campground, trailer park, tourist home, bed
    and breakfast vacation establishment or vacation home.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>The appellants place particular
    reliance on the Divisional Court decision in <i>Putnam v. Grand River Conservation
    Authority</i> (2006), 210 O.A.C. 191 which held that year-round cottage properties
    did not fall within the predecessor to s. 5(a) of the <i>RTA</i> since the
    properties were not “part of a cottage or cabin establishment” that was analogous
    to a hotel, motel or the other types of accommodation set out in the definition.  Accordingly,
    the appellants wish us to make a determination on appeal as to the applicability
    of the <i>RTA </i>or to refer the matter for hearing before the Landlord
    and Tenant Board.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
class=bold>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    general rule is that appellate courts will not entertain entirely new issues
    on appeal.  The rationale for the rule is that it is unfair to spring a new
    argument upon a party at the hearing of an appeal in circumstances in which
    evidence might have been led at trial if it had been known that the matter
    would be an issue on appeal: <i>Ontario Energy Savings L.P.&nbsp;v.&nbsp;767269
    Ontario Ltd.</i>,&nbsp;2008 ONCA 350, at para. 3.  The burden is on the appellant
    to persuade the appellate court that “<span class=italics>all the facts necessary
    to address the point are before the court as fully as if the issue had been
    raised at trial”: <i>Ross. v. Ross</i> (1999), 181 N.S.R. (2d) 22 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), at para. 34, per Cromwell J.A.; <i>Ontario Energy Savings </i>at para.
    3.  </span>This burden may be more easily discharged where the issue sought
    to be raised involves a question of pure law: see e.g. <span class=verdana><i>R.
    v. Vidulich</i> (1989), 37 B.C.L.R. (2d) 391 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    );</span> <i>R. v. Brown</i>, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 918, per L’Heureux-Dubé J.,
    dissenting<span class=bold>.</span>  <span class=bold>In the end, however,
    the decision of whether to grant leave to allow a new argument is a discretionary
    decision to be guided by the balancing of the interests of justice as they
    affect all parties: <i>R. v. Warsing</i>, [1998] 3 S.C.R. 579, </span>per
    L’Heureux-Dubé J., dissenting<span class=bold>; <i>R. v. Sweeney</i> (2000),
    50 O.R. (3d) 321 (C.A.); </span><span class=verdana><i>Vidulich</i></span><span
class=bold> at pp. 398-99.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
class=bold>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=bold>In
      my opinion, it would be contrary to the interests of justice to entertain
      the appellants’ argument respecting the <i>RTA</i> with a view to having
      the issue of the applicability of the Act determined by this court or at
      a new hearing.  Five reasons support this conclusion.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    appeals cannot be conducted without any regard for the pleadings and positions
    advanced at trial.  The majority of the relief requested – a declaration
    that the appellants had an equitable interest in the cottage property, rectification
    and specific performance of a lease, a declaration that an unsigned lease
    was valid, and damages – had nothing to do with the <i>RTA</i>.  Having regard
    to the fact that the appellants’ arguments at trial did not succeed and that
    they did not challenge them on appeal, it is clear that there was “no error
    at trial in this case” and that the appellants are seeking “an opportunity
    to present a whole new case” based on a statute that was neither pleaded
    nor argued before the Superior Court.  To allow them to raise the <i>RTA</i> in
    these circumstances would run “contrary to the basic purpose of an appeal
    which is to correct trial error”: <i>Canadiana Towers Ltd. v. Fawcett</i> (1978),
    21 O.R. (2d) 545 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the issue of whether the <i>RTA </i>applies to the cottage property appears
    to involve an application of facts to a legal definition and is thus a question
    of mixed fact and law.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  Since the <i>RTA</i> was neither raised nor contemplated
    at trial, the factual record regarding the nature and use of the property
    is sparse.  All that is known is that it was a cottage and that the Kaiman
    family used it during the summers over the duration of the lease period and
    sometimes over Christmas for a couple of weeks.  Had the respondents known
    that the <i>RTA </i>would have been in issue, they could have developed a
    more fulsome record on these matters so as to support their contention that
    the <i>RTA </i>does not apply.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    no explanation has been put forward as to why this argument was not raised
    at trial. Counsel on this appeal, who did not represent the appellants at
    trial, does not allege negligence or incompetence on the part of trial counsel.  Nor
    is there any affidavit from trial counsel to the effect that the <i>RTA</i> was
    not pleaded or raised due to inadvertence.  We are simply asked to speculate
    that this is in fact what happened.  The appellants should not be allowed
    to have a second chance based on speculation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
class=ssl2>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Fourth,
    in seeking to be allowed to raise this issue, the appellants did not undertake
    to save harmless the respondents from their costs at trial on a full indemnity
    basis or offer to pay the costs of the appeal on this basis.  The fact that
    the appellants did not ensure that the respondents would be adequately compensated
    in costs for their failure to raise the <i>RTA </i>at trial is a factor that
    has been held to weigh against allowing new arguments on appeal: see e.g. <span class=bold><i>V.S.
    v. Nova Scotia (Minister of Health) </i>(2006), </span><span
class=ssl2>249 N.S.R. (2d) 185 (C.A.), at para. 28.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fifth,
    even if this court were to refer the question of whether the cottage property
    was subject to the <i>RTA </i>to the Landlord and Tenant Board, the likelihood
    of success of the appellants’ argument is by no means clear and is outweighed
    by the interests of finality.  The approach in <i>Putnam </i>appears to depart
    from previous approaches taken by the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court to the interpretation of s. 5(a) of the <i>RTA </i>and its
    predecessor, s. 3(a) of the <i>Tenant Protection Act, 1997</i>, S.O. 1997,
    c. 24.  In <i>McCormick</i> <i>v. Paul Bunyan Trailer Camp Ltd</i>. (1999),
    22 R.P.R. (4th) 305 (Div. Ct.), Aitken J. held that all that was necessary
    for the exemption to apply was that: (1) the living accommodation falls within
    one of the categories set out in the definition; and (2) it is intended to
    be occupied for a seasonal or temporary period.  It is arguable that this
    could be said of the cottage at issue in this case.  It would be unfair to
    the respondents to allow the appellants to rely on the <i>RTA </i>on appeal
    in light of the state of the authorities and this sparse factual record.  It
    would also be unfair to the respondents to have them undergo the expense
    of yet another hearing at first instance simply because a fresh lawyer on
    the case thought of a new argument that may or may not succeed.<i></i></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    regard to the positions advanced in the pleadings and at trial, the issue
    being one of mixed fact and law, the lack of any explanation as to why the
    argument was not raised at trial, the lack of any undertaking by the appellants’ with
    respect to costs on a full indemnity basis, the likelihood of success of
    the new argument and the interests of finality, it would be contrary to the
    interests of justice to allow the appellants to raise the new argument concerning
    the <i>RTA </i>at this late stage.<i> </i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal.  Costs of the appeal are to the
    respondents and, as agreed, are fixed at $2,500, all inclusive, to each respondent. </p>
