    agreed to act as a courier for two brothers, about whom we know little. His

w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    with not one, but two suitcases. He assumed that the suitcases contained

    Airport, he was referred for a secondary examination. An x-ray revealed a

    the discovery of a light brown lumpy substance located under false covers
    in both suitcases. </p>

    brown lumpy substance proved to be heroin – 9.56 kilograms (21 pounds) to
    be exact, with a purity of 61 to 77 percent and a street value of between
    $4.78 and $6.69 million. The heroin seized from the respondent represented
    11.4 percent of all of the heroin seized by Canadian police forces in 2005;
    for street purposes, it represented a monumental 430,290
    “hits”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Apart
    from his age and lack of criminal antecedents, the respondent had little
    else to offer by way of mitigation. His claim that he was motivated to commit
    the crime because of unspecified financial difficulties rings somewhat hollow.
    At the time of the offence, he was gainfully employed as a truck driver and
    living with his mother and three sisters. He planned to use the $20,000 as
    a down payment on a house. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    short, like many, if not most cases involving first offender couriers, the
    respondent was vulnerable. His youth and lack of sophistication, his apparent
    need for money and his clean record made him a prime target for the two men
    who enlisted his services. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Be
    that as it may, as this court explained in <i>R. v. Cunningham</i> (1996),
    104 C.C.C. (3d) 542 at 547, concerns for “the plight of many couriers” must “give
    way to the need to protect society from the untold grief and misery occasioned
    by the illicit use of hard drugs.” And lest there be any doubt about it,
    heroin represents the worst of the hard drugs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge in the instant case questioned that proposition but was prepared,
    in the end, to assume “that heroin is a marginally more dangerous drug than
    cocaine”, thereby warranting “a marginal increase” in the range of sentences
    identified for cocaine importation (para. 70).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s characterization of heroin as
    “marginally” more dangerous than cocaine finds no support in the record,
    nor in the existing case law. Time and again, this court and the Supreme
    Court of Canada have made it clear that heroin is the most pernicious of
    the hard drugs
    – it is the most addictive, the most destructive and the most dangerous.
    Heroin trafficking has been described as a “despicable” crime and one that “tears
    at the very fabric of our society”: see <i>Pushpanathan v. Canada</i>, [1998]
    1 S.C.R. 982 at para. 79; <i>R. v. Nguyen</i> (1996), 92 O.A.C. 200 at para.
    9; <i>R. v. Sherman</i>, [2001] O.J. No. 5008 (S.C.) at para. 18; aff’d (2004),
    183 O.A.C. 198; and <i>R. v. Osei</i>, [2002] O.J. No. 5601 (S.C.) at para.
    7, aff’d 2004 CanLII 25984 (C.A.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s treatment of heroin as only
    “marginally” more dangerous than cocaine led him into error in assessing
    the appropriate range of sentence for first offender couriers who import
    large amounts of high grade heroin for personal gain. Specifically, we respectfully
    disagree with the trial judge’s conclusion that the sentencing range for
    such individuals should only be “marginally” higher than the range of sentences
    (six to eight years, per <i>Cunningham</i>) for first offender couriers who
    import large amounts of cocaine for personal gain.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    we recognize that sentencing is not an exact science and that trial judges
    must retain the necessary flexibility to do justice in individual cases,
    as a general rule, absent exceptional or extenuating circumstances, first
    offender couriers who import large amounts of high grade heroin into Canada
    for personal gain should expect to receive sentences consistent with the
    twelve to seventeen year range suggested by the Crown. To be clear, when
    we refer to &ldquo;large amounts&rdquo; of high grade heroin, we are not
    referring solely to multiple kilograms; as authorities from this court and
    other courts show, lesser amounts will often attract similar, if slightly
    lower, penalties (see para. 20 below).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    range of sentence may seem harsh to some, but it is necessary to protect
    our country and our citizens from the ravages of heroin. Those who would
    engage in its importation must know that they will pay a heavy price.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    that regard, some clarification is needed to address the significance, if
    any, of couriers, like the respondent, who purposefully shut their eyes to
    the nature and quantity of the illicit substance they are importing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge considered the respondent’s wilful blindness to be a mitigating
    circumstance. With respect, we disagree. As a matter of principle and policy,
    we ought not to be sending a message to would-be-couriers that if they wear
    blinders, they will receive a lower sentence than if they actually learn
    the nature and quantity of the substance they are importing. In assessing
    degrees of moral blameworthiness, we see no meaningful distinction between
    the two.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    so concluding, we are not to be taken as departing from the principle enunciated
    by this court in <i>R. v. H. (C.N.)</i> (2002), 170 C.C.C. (3d) 253 – that
    where an offender takes reasonable steps to determine the nature of the drug
    and is duped by his co-conspirators, this will serve as a mitigating factor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That,
    however, is not this case. The respondent was wilfully blind to the nature
    and quantity of the substance he was importing. Having kept himself in the
    dark, he cannot rely on his lack of knowledge as a mitigating factor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, despite the appellant’s youth and lack of criminal background,
    for personal gain he imported an enormous amount of high grade heroin into
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    . There are few reported cases where couriers have been found in possession
    of like amounts. But those that exist and others that involve much smaller
    amounts confirm the range of sentence that we have suggested: see for example, <i>R.
    v. Kwok</i> (1986), 31 C.C.C. (3d) 196 (Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C.
    refused (1987), 24 O.A.C. 160, where the amount of heroin imported was 7.7
    pounds (3.49 kilograms) and the courier is reported to have received a sentence
    of thirteen years imprisonment on a plea of guilty; <i>R. v. Mostafalou</i> (October
    21, 1992), Toronto, C11611 (Ont. C.A.), in which a sentence of nine-and-a-half
    years, in addition to six-and-a-half months of pretrial custody, was upheld
    for importing 489 grams of heroin; <i>R. v.</i> <i>Anaso</i>, [2002] O.J.
    4452 (Ont. C.A.), where the accused received a sentence of eight years, in
    addition to two years and four months credit for pretrial custody, for her
    courier-like role in attempting to export 1.13 pounds (512 grams) of heroin; <i>R.
    v. Mensah</i> (2003), 170 O.A.C. 244, leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused,
    [2003] S.C.C.A. No. 207, where the accused received a global sentence of
    nine years, less credit for pretrial custody of twenty-and-a-half months,
    for importing 1.038 kilograms of heroin; <i>R. v. Jantuah</i> (1993), 62
    Q.A.C. 19, where the Quebec Court of Appeal upheld a sentence of ten years,
    in addition to six months pretrial custody, for the importation of 475 grams
    of heroin; <i>R. v. Tsoi and Chan</i> (1982), 36 A.R. 606 (Alta. Q.B.), where
    the co-accused courier was sentenced to ten years after pleading guilty to
    importing two pounds (907 grams) of heroin;<i> R. v. Thambiah</i> (1987),
    23 O.A.C. 394, in which a sentence of fifteen years was upheld for the importation
    of 30 pounds (13.6 kilograms) of high grade heroin. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the situation at hand approximates the situation in <i>Thambiah</i>.
    In the result, the appeal is allowed and the sentence imposed at trial is
    increased to fourteen years and nine months imprisonment. A fresh evidence
    report received on appeal from Corrections indicates that the respondent
    is doing well at the Beaver Creek Institution. While it will be for the Correctional
    authorities to determine, we would recommend that the respondent be allowed
    to remain at Beaver Creek to complete the balance of his sentence.</p>
