      main issue on this appeal is whether the transition provisions in the <i>Limitations

      proposed counterclaims for contribution and indemnity.</span></p>

      Green was in a rear-end collision with Mr. and Mrs. Placzek before the
      new Act came into force. After the new Act came into force, the Placzeks
      sued Mr. Green for damages arising from the accident.</span><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:14.0pt'> </span></p>

      than two years after delivering his statement of defence, Mr. Green asked
      for an order allowing him to add counterclaims for contribution and indemnity
      with respect to Mrs. Placzek’s damages against Mr. Placzek and two new
      parties. In support of his request, Mr. Green submitted that he did not
      discover his proposed counterclaims until his examination for discovery,
      and that the basic two-year limitation period under the new Act with respect
      to his counterclaims had not therefore expired. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      J. dismissed Mr. Green’s motion, holding that Mr. Green discovered his
      proposed counterclaims on the date he was served with the Placzeks’ statement
      of claim and that the basic two-year limitation period under the new Act
      had, in fact, expired. In addition, the motion judge found that all of
      the proposed defendants would be prejudiced if Mr. Green was allowed to
      amend at this stage. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      appeal, Mr. Green does not challenge the motion judge’s conclusion that
      the limitation periods under the new Act have expired, assuming they apply. </span>Rather<span lang=EN-US>, he claims for the first
      time that he discovered his proposed counterclaims on the date of the accident
      and therefore, under the transition provisions in the new Act, the limitation
      periods in place before the new Act came into force (the “former limitation
      periods”) govern. According to Mr. Green, the former limitation periods
      have not expired. </span></p>

      Green also claims that the motion judge erred in finding prejudice that
      should preclude his amendments even if the limitation periods have not
      expired. </span></p>

      the reasons that follow, I conclude that the transition provisions in the
      new Act do not apply to Mr. Green’s proposed counterclaims and that the
      limitation periods in the new Act govern. Accordingly, I would dismiss
      the appeal on the limitations ground and it is unnecessary that I deal
      with the prejudice issue. </span></p>

      that Mr. Placzek’s erratic driving caused the accident. As against General
      Motors and McMaster, Mr. Green claims that they were negligent in the manufacture

      that the basic two-year limitation period under the new Act, which runs
      from the discovery of a claim, would not expire until April 2009.</span></p>

      motion judge said:</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><span

    should also add that the law concerning the former limitation period(s) that
    applied to contribution and indemnity claims under s. 1 of the <i>Negligence
    Act</i> is not entirely clear. Since a contribution and indemnity claim is
    not a claim for damages arising from the accident, I am not persuaded that
    Mr. Green was correct in asserting that the six-year limitation period applicable
    to negligence actions generally applied; nor am I persuaded that the respondents
    were correct in asserting that the two-year limitation period under s. 206
    of the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. H. 8, applied in this
    case. </p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText>In my opinion, unless the injured party’s limitation
    period against the concurrent tortfeasors had expired (in which case s. 8
    of the <i>Negligence Act</i> would have governed), the applicable limitation
    period was likely the six-year limitation period applicable to actions on
    the case under s. 45(1)(g) of the <i>Limitations Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.
    L.15.  See e.g. <i>Peel (
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Regional
    <st1:PlaceType
w:st="on">
    Municipality) v.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    </i>, [1987] 3 F.C. 103.</p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText>I do not think the applicable limitation period was
    the two-year period applicable to actions under a statute under s. 45(1)(h)
    of the former <i>Limitations Act</i> because that section has been interpreted
    as being restricted to penal provisions (see <i>Zurich Indemnity Co. of Canada
    v. Matthews</i> (2005), 254 D.L.R. (4th) 97 (Ont. C.A.) and <i>West End Construction
    Ltd. v. (Ontario (Ministry of Labour)</i> (1989), 70 O.R. (2d)133 (C.A.)).
    Section 1 of the <i>Negligence Act</i> is not such a provision.</p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText>I cannot rule out entirely the possibility that the
    relevant limitation period was the six-year limitation period applicable
    to actions on a contract or for a debt under s. 45(1)(g) of the <i>Limitations
    Act</i>, but I think it is more likely that the limitation period for actions
    on the case applied: see Cheifetz at p. 77-79; and <i>Baker</i>.</p>
