    is an appeal from the judgment of Cullity J., dated May 29, 2008, which granted
    specific performance of an option to lease agreement (OLA) between Midas
    Realty Corporation of Canada Inc. (“Midas”) and Galvic Investments Limited
    (“Galvic”) following an application brought by Midas.  In so doing, the application
    judge granted Midas possession of premises owned by Galvic in priority over
    a pre-existing lease between Galvic and its tenant, 618818 Ontario Inc. (“Tenant”).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Galvic
    and Tenant are related corporations.  The application judge found that, at
    the relevant times, Gail Rudachuk and her daughter, Victoria Rudachuk, were
    the sole directors and officers of Galvic and Tenant.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    premises were purchased by Galvic in 1981.  At that time, Midas was a lessee
    and had sublet the premises to a Midas franchisee.  In 1985, Tenant acquired
    the franchise and became a subtenant of Midas.  When the lease between Midas
    and Galvic expired in 2001, a new arrangement was negotiated among the parties.  Three
    documents were prepared as part of this arrangement:  a new franchise agreement
    between Midas
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    (as the franchisor) and Tenant (as the franchisee); a lease between Galvic
    and Tenant; and the OLA between Galvic and Midas.  Tenant chose to terminate
    the franchise on June 28, 2007, and has not carried on business on the premises
    since July 2007.  On receiving notice of the termination, Midas purported
    to exercise an option to acquire a lease of the premises, and required Galvic
    to execute the same, pursuant to the OLA.  When Galvic refused, the application
    was brought.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge found that the three documents had been prepared as part
    of an arrangement.  He further found that Galvic, Tenant and Gail and Victoria
    were acting in concert in the connected and substantially contemporaneous
    transactions that led to the execution of the three documents.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Galvic
    appeals.  It argues that the application judge erred in: (1) finding that
    Midas’s right under the OLA is superior to Tenant’s right under the pre-existing
    lease; (2) failing to interpret the OLA in accordance with the doctrine of <i>contra
    proferentum</i>; and, (3) finding that the premises are unique and on that
    basis granting specific performance.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Tenant
    joins with Galvic.  It reinforces Galvic’s first ground of appeal, stressing
    that the application judge erred in elevating Midas’ contractual claim over
    its pre-existing interest in, and right to quiet enjoyment of, the premises.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    relation to the first issue, we see no palpable and overriding error in the
    application judge having found that Gail, Victoria, Galvic and Tenant were
    acting in concert in the connected, and substantially contemporaneous, transactions
    that led to the three agreements being executed.  Further, we see no error
    in his finding that having induced Midas
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    to grant the franchise to Tenant by executing the OLA,
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Gail,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Victoria and the two corporations were acting in concert to frustrate Midas’ attempt
    to enforce the OLA.  On the record, the application judge was fully justified
    in making those findings of fact, in finding that the equities warranted
    an order requiring Galvic to perform its obligations under the OLA, and in
    declaring that the lease between Tenant and Galvic was terminated.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    respect to the second issue, the application judge interpreted the OLA such
    that Galvic did not have a unilateral right to refuse to execute and deliver
    the lease on Midas’ request.  This interpretation is consistent with the
    fundamental principle that the proper interpretation of a contract is one
    which promotes the true intent of the parties at the time of entry into the
    contract.  The application judge’s finding that the purpose of the OLA was
    to ensure the continued presence of Midas on the premises is entirely consistent
    with the recitals contained in the OLA.  Having interpreted the language
    of the provisions of the OLA by reference to the purposes of that agreement,
    as disclosed in the recitals, there was no need for the application judge
    to resort to the principle of <i>contra proferentum</i>.
     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not accept that the application judge erred as suggested in the third
    ground of appeal.  Contrary to Galvic’s submission, on the record, the application
    judge was entitled to find that the premises had the requisite uniqueness
    to justify an order for specific performance.  In this regard, it is telling
    that the franchise agreement itself reserves to Midas the right to select
    the site, and that the franchisee is granted the right to operate a Midas
    shop only at the designated location as selected by Midas.  Although the
    application judge did not refer expressly in his reasons to the requirement
    that there be a fair, real and substantial justification for substantial
    performance, this standard is implicit in his reasons.  His reasons also
    make it clear that the standard was satisfied.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    its factum, Galvic also impugned the application judge for not weighing the
    benefit versus the burden of specific performance on the basis of the parties.  We
    do not accept that this complaint is well-founded as there was no evidence
    on the record regarding the effect that specific performance would have on
    Galvic, except for the fact that Tenant’s lease would come to an end.  As
    Tenant had ceased carrying on business on the premises before Midas sought
    to exercise the option to acquire a lease of the premises, it is hard to
    see what prejudice it would suffer.  In any event, we agree with the application
    judge that the equities in this case favour Midas, not Galvic.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    short, we find no error in the reasons of the application judge.  On the
    contrary, we endorse them.  The application judge articulated and applied
    the correct legal principles and his detailed findings are fully justified
    on the record.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Midas
    asked this court to vary the date on which the lease is to begin.  Counsel
    for Midas properly conceded that this matter had been raised for the first
    time on appeal.  We decline to decide the matter for that reason – it is
    an issue which needs to be properly argued and decided in the context of
    an appropriate evidentiary record.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons given, the appeal is dismissed.  In the view of the court, there
    is no basis to award costs other than on a partial indemnity scale.  Costs
    of the appeal to the respondent are fixed at $15,000, all inclusive.  </p>
