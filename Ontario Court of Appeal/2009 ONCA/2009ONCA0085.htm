lang=EN-US>INTRODUCTION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Jeremy
    Corkery is one of a group of defendants being sued by Bell ExpressVu Limited
    Partnership in one action, and by EchoStar Satellite LLC and others in a
    second.  The plaintiffs in both actions claim similar relief against the
    same defendants in relation to unauthorized access to, and trafficking in,
    satellite television signals.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    February 20, 2008, Justice Spence found Mr. Corkery in contempt of earlier
    orders granted in both proceedings on November 16, 2007 (the “November 16
    Orders”), and struck his statements of defence primarily for failing to pay
    costs of the proceedings which resulted in the November 16 Orders.  The November
    16 Orders were a follow up to an Anton Piller Order obtained by the plaintiffs
    at the beginning of the proceedings and permitting them, among other things,
    to copy information from certain computers in Mr. Corkery’s possession.  Some
    of the copied information turned out to be unreadable, for various technical
    reasons.   Under the November 16 Orders, Mr. Corkery was required to allow
    Bell ExpressVu and EchoStar to attend at his premises to re-image (i.e.,
    copy) certain computer hard drives and removable storage media in order to
    rectify the problem.  In circumstances that I shall outline, this never happened,
    and Spence J. ultimately found Mr. Corkery in contempt and struck his statements
    of defence in both actions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Corkery seeks to set aside that disposition.  For the reasons that follow,
    I would allow the appeal.</p>
  <h3>FACTS</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents allege that the appellant and other defendants were illegally
    facilitating unauthorized access to their encrypted satellite television
    programming signals.  They obtained the Anton Piller Order and an interlocutory
    injunction from Morawetz J. on July 20, 2006.  On July 26, the Anton Piller
    Order was executed at the appellant’s place of business (
    <st1:address
w:st="on">
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    5974 Main St.,
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Niagara Falls) and his former home (
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    <st1:Street
 w:st="on">
    6092 Trillium Crescent,
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
  w:st="on">
    Niagara Falls).  As part of that exercise, a number of computer hard drives
    were copied onto what is called a “Western Digital”
    WD2500JB computer hard drive (the “
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Western Digital Drive”).  A law firm was appointed as Independent Supervising
    Solicitor (“ISS”) under the Anton Piller Order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents subsequently discovered that the
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Western Digital Drive had malfunctioned.  The information and evidence copied
    onto it could not be accessed or copied further.  The respondents therefore
    applied for orders permitting them to re-image (i.e., re-copy the information
    from) the computer hard drives and electronic media devices from which the
    information had originally been copied.  Spence J. granted the order requested
    in each action on November 16, 2007.  Paragraph 2 of the orders state:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><u>The
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Bell ExpressVu Order</u></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>2. THIS COURT ORDERS that the Plaintiff, Bell Expressvu
    Limited Partnership be permitted to re-attend the business premise of the
    Defendant, Jeremy Corkery (“Corkery”), for the purpose of re-imaging the
    computer hard drives and removable media which were initially copied onto
    the Western Digital Drive.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><u>The EchoStar Order</u></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>2. THIS COURT ORDERS that the Plaintiffs may re-attend
    the premises of the Defendant, Jeremy Corkery (“Corkery”), for the purpose
    of re-imaging the computer hard drives and removable media which were initially
    copied onto the Western Digital Drive.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    there are differences between the two orders.  In the Bell ExpressVu order,
    the plaintiffs are permitted “to re-attend <i>the business premise</i> of
    the Defendant”, whereas in the EchoStar order they may
    “re-attend <i>the premises</i> of the Defendant” (emphasis added).  These
    differences became a source of contention and confusion, exacerbated by the
    fact that Mr. Corkery apparently vacated his business premises at
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    5974 Main St. following the execution of the Anton Piller Order and before
    the November 16 Orders. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant attended the motion before Spence J. on November 16, although he
    was unrepresented at the time.  He was present when the motion judge read
    his endorsement and was provided with a copy of that endorsement.  He was
    also provided with a copy of the order as issued and entered by way of an
    e-mail message sent to him on December 3, 2007.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Bell
    ExpressVu and EchoStar say that the appellant deliberately failed to comply
    with the November 16 Orders.  Mr. Corkery says he never deliberately disobeyed
    them.  He maintains: (a) that it took time for him to arrange a day off work
    on a date that was acceptable for the respondents, or their representatives,
    to attend; (b) that there were difficulties in clarifying the place of attendance;
    and (c) that alternate suggestions to address the foregoing problems – for
    example, that the hard drives be brought to the offices of the ISS for copying – were
    met with unacceptable and improper demands by the respondents to access his <i>computers</i> (as
    opposed to the permissible access to the <i>hard drives and electronic media</i> in
    question).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All
    of this can be traced in a series of e-mail exchanges that took place between
    November 20, 2007 (when counsel for the respondents made his first request
    for convenient times within the ensuing two weeks when their computer forensics
    expert and the ISS could re-attend) and December 6 (the evening before a
    9:30 a.m. appointment obtained to schedule proceedings to enforce the Order).  As
    is often the case in disputes of this nature, it is possible to find elements
    in support of both sides’ positions in this exchange.  At the end of the
    day, however, the respondents had not yet been provided with access to the
    hard drives and removable media devices in question.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the 9:30 appointment on December 7, the motions for contempt and to strike
    the appellant’s statements of defence were scheduled for January 30, 2008.  On
    January 17, the appellant was served with the notices of motion in each action.  The
    contempt motion was founded on his conduct in allegedly interfering with
    the respondents’ right to attend and re-image the hard drives and electronic
    devices.  The motion to strike was based primarily on his failure to pay
    the costs ordered against him at the time of the November 16 Orders.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant did not serve or file any responding materials, but on January
    30 sought an adjournment and served a number of summonses to witnesses.  The
    motion judge refused the adjournment and quashed the summonses.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  Although proceedings commenced that day, the
    motion was put over in any event because there was insufficient time to hear
    it.  As the motion judge was seized of the matter, a new date was set for
    February 19, 2007.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    February 18, the appellant delivered six of the ten contested hard drives
    to the offices of the ISS.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    February 19, the appellant sought leave to file materials and, again, an
    adjournment.  He was represented by counsel at this time.  The motion judge
    refused both requests and proceeded to hear the motions, which he disposed
    of by way of a very brief endorsement the following day.  His reasoning with
    respect to the contempt finding is contained entirely in the following two
    sentences:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Based on the material of the plaintiffs and in
    particular the course of conduct shown in the communication between the parties
    in the motion records of the plaintiffs, the defendant Mr. Corkery deliberately
    interfered with the proper efforts of the plaintiffs to exercise the authority
    and receive the benefit of the court order of Nov 16/07. This interference
    constitutes contempt of this Court order. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to the motion to strike, he said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The costs of the plaintiffs’ motions in respect
    of the Nov 16/07 order were ordered to be payable within 30 days.  The costs
    have not been paid.  Mr. Corkery has failed to comply with the order in this
    respect as well.  It is not apparent that Mr. Corkery has a strong defence
    in the merits in the actions against him.  There is no evidence as to Mr.
    Corkery’s means.  No reason is shown why his defence should not be struck.  In

  <h3>The Contempt Finding</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not need to deal with the two procedural issues raised by the appellant,
    because I am persuaded that the appeal must be allowed on the third ground.  In
    any event, I have read the reasons of my colleague Justice Sharpe, and I
    agree with his disposition of the issues respecting the allegedly deficient
    notice of motion and introduction of hearsay evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the third ground, however, I agree with the appellant that the motion judge
    either failed to turn his mind to the test to be applied in making a finding
    of civil contempt or, if he did, that he applied the test improperly.  Nowhere
    in the motion judge’s brief six-line endorsement on the contempt issue does
    he address this important question.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents seek to imprison the appellant for a civil contempt.  Indeed,
    Ms. Bambrough confirmed at the outset of argument that her instructions were
    to seek a jail term, and only alternatively, a fine, if the matter proceeds.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    finding of contempt of court is a serious matter that is quasi-criminal in
    nature.  It is
    “first and foremost a declaration that a party has acted in defiance of a
    court order”: <i>Pro Swing Inc. v. Elta Golf Inc., </i>[2006] 2 S.C.R. 612,
    at para. 35.  The potential penal sanctions facing a contemnor underscore
    the seriousness of such a finding.  As the Supreme Court of Canada has observed, “[t]<span style='color:#3A3A3A'>he
    penalty for contempt of court, even when it is used to enforce a purely private
    order, still involves an element of ‘public law’, in a sense, because respect
    for the role and authority of the courts, one of the foundations of the rule
    of law, is always at issue”: <i>Pro Swing, </i>at para. </span><span
lang=FR-CA style='color:#3A3A3A;'>34, citing </span><i><span

    [1992] 2 S.C.R. 1065, at p. 1075.  </span>This court has recently reaffirmed
    these principles in <i>Korea Data Systems Co. v. Chiang, </i>2009 ONCA 3,
    at paras. 10-11.  It is for these reasons that motions for contempt are often
    said to be <i>strictissimi juris</i>, i.e., that all proper procedures must
    be strictly complied with: see <i>Dare Foods (Biscuit Divisions) Ltd. v.
    Gill</i>, [1973] 1 O.R. 637 (H.C.J.); <i>Toronto Transit Commission v. Ryan</i> (1998),
    37 O.R. (3d) 266 (Gen. Div.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    three constituent elements of the test for civil contempt were summarized
    by this court in <i>Prescott-Russell Services for Children and Adults v.
    G.(N.)</i> (2006), 82 O.R. (3d) 686, at para. 27:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The criteria applicable to a contempt of court
    conclusion are settled law.  A three-pronged test is required.  First, the
    order that was breached must state clearly and unequivocally what should
    and should not be done.  Secondly, the party who disobeys the order must
    do so deliberately and wilfully.  Thirdly, the evidence must show contempt
    beyond a reasonable doubt.  Any doubt must clearly be resolved in favour
    of the person or entity alleged to have breached the order.  [Citations omitted.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>See
    also <i>Hobbs v. Hobbs </i>(2008), 54 R.F.L. (6<sup>th</sup>) 1, at paras.
    26-28.  In relation to the first of these elements, it must be clear to a
    party exactly what must be done to be in compliance with the terms of an
    order: <i>Pro Swing, </i>at para. 24.  In relation to the third element,
    the requirement of proof beyond a reasonable doubt ensures that the potential
    penal consequences of a finding of contempt are not ordered lightly: <i>Korea
    Data Systems, </i>at paras. 10-11. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    noted, the reasons of the motion judge were exceedingly brief.  I do not
    suggest that such reasons must necessarily analyse the application of the
    established three-pronged test to the facts of the case in great detail:
    see
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <i>Hobbs</i><i>, </i>at paras. 26-28.  However, a motion judge must at a
    minimum turn his or her mind to the test and apply the elements of the test
    properly.  Here, the motion judge did not do so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Instead,
    he focused solely on the question of deliberate and wilful disobedience of
    the orders.  The motion judge does not appear to have considered the requirements
    that the terms of an order must be sufficiently clear and unequivocal or
    that contempt must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.  The strength of
    a finding of deliberate disobedience of an order weakens progressively with
    the lack of clarity in the terms of the order against which the disobedience
    must be measured.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    parties engaged in a debate via e-mail over what business premises the November
    16 Orders referred to and where the re-attendance to re-image should take
    place.  The discrepancies between the two orders appear to have been at the
    root of this exchange of communications and to have led to confusion regarding
    the meaning of the orders.  In the Bell ExpressVu order, the plaintiffs are
    permitted “to re-attend <i>the business premise</i> of the Defendant”, whereas
    in the EchoStar order they may
    “re-attend <i>the premises</i> of the Defendant”. (emphasis added)  To complicate
    matters further, Mr. Corkery asserts that the respondents were aware of his
    having moved business premises in the time between the execution of the Anton
    Piller Order and the November 16 Orders. The respondents profess to have
    no knowledge of such a move.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents were permitted to re-attend “for the purpose of re-imaging the
    computer hard drives and removable media which were initially copied onto
    the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Western Digital Drive.”  However, there is apparently no list of the hard
    drives and removable disks in question.  The appellant took the position
    that he had some, but not all of them, and, indeed, he delivered 6 out of
    a total of 10 in issue to the offices of the ISS on February 18, the day
    before the argument of the motion.  Moreover, there is some indication in
    the record that several of the hard drives and removable disks may not have
    belonged to or been in the possession of the appellant, but, rather, belonged
    to and may have been in the possession of his clients.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>None
    of these matters were addressed by the motion judge, nor does any consideration
    appear to have been given to whether or not the terms of the November 16
    Orders were sufficiently clear and unequivocal in the circumstances to support
    a finding of contempt.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Those
    Orders did not provide a blank cheque to the respondents to re-examine the
    appellant’s computers in any location, at any time.  They provided instead
    access to hard drives and removable media at the appellant’s “business premises” or
    “premises”.  There was too much scope for confusion regarding the actual
    terms of the November 16 Orders – as evidenced by the communications between
    the parties – to find the appellant in contempt, in my view.  In this respect,
    I agree with the following observations of Cullity J. in <i>Jaskhs Enterprises
    Inc. v. Indus Corp.</i>, [2004] O.J. No. 4062 (S.C.J.), at para. 40:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[A] failure to comply with an order of the court
    will not be contempt if there are genuine, unresolved issues between the
    parties with respect to the manner in which it is to be carried into operation.  A
    finding of contempt will not be made for breach of an order unless its meaning
    and requirements in the particular circumstances are clear and unambiguous.
    [Citations omitted.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor
    does the motion judge seem to have considered the question of the burden
    of proof – a matter that may well be important in this case.  The burden
    is on the party seeking the contempt order to establish contempt on the evidence
    beyond a reasonable doubt.  Probability is not sufficient.  While a good
    case may be made that the appellant was in all likelihood ragging the puck
    as much as he could in terms of facilitating the respondents’ re-imaging
    exercise, whether it could be said beyond a reasonable doubt that he was
    deliberately interfering with the respondents’ rights under the orders may
    be another story.  It is not clear what standard the motion judge applied
    in making his finding that “Mr. Corkery deliberately interfered with the
    proper efforts of the plaintiffs to exercise the authority and receive the
    benefit of the court order of Nov 16/07.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    while the motion judge applied his mind to the second criterion for a finding
    of contempt – i.e., whether the appellant had “deliberately and wilfully” disobeyed
    his orders – he does not seem to have considered the equally important first
    and third criteria, namely whether the terms of the orders were clear and
    unequivocal and whether the record established a finding of contempt beyond
    a reasonable doubt.  He thus left issues arising on the record touching both
    of these criteria unresolved.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is for these reasons that I take a different view of Mr. Corkery’s compliance
    or non-compliance with the November 16 Orders for purposes of a contempt
    finding than does my colleague.  I am satisfied the finding of contempt cannot
    stand and must be set aside.</p>
  <h3>The Order Striking the Statements of Defence</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    am also satisfied that the orders striking out the appellant’s statements
    of defence must be set aside as well.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge based his decision to strike on three grounds:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(i)   The appellant’s failure to pay the costs
    of the November 16 Orders;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(ii) The appellant’s conduct on the basis of which
    he had been found in contempt; and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(iii) The fact that it was not apparent the appellant
    has a strong defence on the merits.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge concluded that “no reason [was] shown why his defence should
    not be struck.”  Respectfully, this approach transfers the onus on the motion
    to strike to the appellant.  It was not for the appellant to demonstrate
    that he had a strong defence on the merits or to show why his defence should
    not be struck.  It was for the respondents to do so.  This flaw is significant,
    given the grounds upon which the motion judge proceeded.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    was open to the motion judge to consider striking the appellant’s defence
    based on his failure to pay the costs of the November 16 Orders and on his
    conduct in relation to those Orders: rules 57.03(2) and 60.12(b).  Striking
    out a defence is a severe remedy, however, and in my opinion ought generally
    not to be a remedy of first resort in circumstances such as this, without
    at least providing the defaulting defendant with an opportunity to cure the
    default.  The appellant was afforded no such opportunity.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge emphasized what he viewed as the lack of a strong defence on
    the merits.  Coupled with the appellant’s conduct – which need not be established
    beyond a reasonable doubt for these purposes – and the failure to abide by
    the costs award, a weak defence <i>could</i> justify an order striking the
    pleadings.  The basis for the motion judge’s conclusion that “it is not apparent
    that Mr. Corkery has a strong defence in the merits in the actions against
    him”
    is puzzling, however.  The appellant’s statements of defence were not in
    the record before him.  Nor, for that matter, were the statements of claim.  There
    is therefore some merit in the appellant’s submission that it was difficult
    for the court to make any finding regarding the relative merits of either
    party’s case.  It is not possible to say whether – supposing he had been
    able to assess the details of the appellant’s defence and it turned out to
    be more meritorious than he had thought – he may have considered the costs
    default and the appellant’s conduct in a different light.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Taken
    in conjunction with the apparent reversal of onus, these considerations lead
    me to conclude that the orders striking the appellant’s defences in the two
    actions must be set aside as well.</p>
  <h3>DISPOSITION</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the foregoing reasons I would allow the appeal and set aside the orders in
    each action finding the appellant in contempt and striking out his statements
    of defence.  I observe in closing, however, that the November 16 Orders remain
    in effect and continue to be binding upon the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

    see no merit to the submission that the notices of motion lacked sufficient
    particulars to bring home to the appellant the basis of the allegation of
    contempt.  Bell ExpressVu sought an order in the following terms:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A<span class=Doubleindent-quoteChar>n order declaring

    notices of motion then provided detailed grounds setting out the crucial
    term of Spence J.’s November 16, 2007 order and alleged that, to date, the

    hard drives.  </p>

    my view, the appellant could have been left in no doubt about the nature
    of the allegations giving rise to the contempt proceedings.  He was named
    as the alleged contemnor.  The acts said to constitute contempt – failure
    to grant the respondents access to his business premises to re-image certain
    hard drives – were specified.  As the allegation involved the ongoing breach
    of an existing order, the date of the alleged contempt – the period following
    the date of the order, November 16, 2007 – was sufficiently identified.  </p>
  <h3><i><span style='font-weight:normal'>2.

    were sufficiently clear and unequivocal to support a finding of contempt
    and his failure to do so should not vitiate his finding of contempt. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the orders which the motion judge himself had made were clear on their face:
    they required the appellant to give the respondents access to his premises
    to allow them to re-image the hard drives they had tried to copy on July
    25, 2006. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    I fail to see how the fact that the appellant had moved his business or moved
    the hard drives from where they had been when the <i>Anton Piller </i>Order
    was first executed could somehow defeat the rights of the respondents or
    render the orders unclear.  Simply put, the order granted the respondents
    access to the hard drives in whatever “business premise” or “premises” the
    appellant was keeping them.  The respondents did not insist, as was their
    right, to actually enter the appellant’s premises; they simply wanted access
    to the hard drives.  Where the hard drives were being kept was a matter entirely
    within the appellant’s knowledge.  In my view, the appellant should not be
    permitted to circumvent the orders by moving the hard drives from one place
    to another. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    it is clear from the record that the appellant was in court when the motion
    judge made his order and that he was provided with a draft order for approval.  It
    was only when he was being pressed for his cooperation and threatened with
    contempt that he took any exception to the wording of the orders.  He filed
    no material to indicate that he did not understand what the orders required
    him to do.  The evidence before the motion judge indicates that the appellant’s
    failure to comply with the orders was the product of his own strategy of
    delay and avoidance rather than the result of any uncertainty or confusion
    about the meaning of the orders.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents’ solicitor sent an e-mail to the appellant on November 20, pressing
    him to approve the draft orders and comply with the orders.  In his response
    sent the following morning, the appellant asked the solicitor for clarification
    as to what premises the respondents wished to attend.  The respondents’ solicitor
    immediately responded as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The purpose of Spence J’s order was to allow us
    to re-image the 10 hard drives found at your business premises (
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    5974 Main St.,
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Niagara Falls) and identified by DEI using the following control numbers:
    401, 402, 403, 405, 408, 409, 410, 411, 412, 413. Our motion materials… provide
    more detail as to which of your computers these hard drives were removed
    from.  You should still have those computers and those hard drives as they
    are considered evidence in this action and must be preserved by you.  It
    will be up to you to advise us where they are currently located.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Please note that time is of the essence on this
    issue as every passing day potentially undermines the integrity of that electronic
    evidence.  As such, please advise us as soon as possible when we can come
    and re-image them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    the appellant again asked for particulars as to the meaning of the word “premises” later
    that same morning, counsel for the respondents replied aptly: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>You need to advise us where the drives are located.  That’s
    within your knowledge, not ours.  The order allows us to enter the premises
    where the drives are located.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    responses accurately captured the meaning of the orders and what the appellant
    was required to do.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    November 27, the appellant advised the respondents’
    agents, who were to do the re-imaging, that he had moved from his office
    at
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    5974 Main St.  It is significant that at this point, there is no suggestion
    of any concern about a lack of clarity in the orders as to where the imaging
    would take place.  Indeed, the appellant indicated that the re-imaging could
    take place at his current premises or, alternatively, that he could bring
    the hard drives to the office of the respondents’ agents.  He added that
    since he lived in a small apartment it would be less than convenient to do
    the re-imaging there and that he “would be agreeable to moving the location” but
    that he would need the “go ahead” to do so.  When he was told that the respondents
    were agreeable to copying the hard drives at their agents’ office but that
    to do so, the appellant would be required to bring both the computers and
    the hard drives, the appellant objected.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    see no merit to the submission that the respondents’
    request that the appellant bring the computers in which the hard drives were
    found on the date of the original search exceeded the ambit of the November
    16 Orders.  The November 16 Orders gave the respondents more than the right
    to have access to the hard drives: they gave them the right to access the
    appellant’s premises for the purpose of re-imaging the hard drives.  Moreover,
    the November 16 Orders have to be read as part and parcel of the original
    Anton Piller Order that gave the respondents broad rights to search electronic
    equipment used by the appellant, required the appellant to preserve the evidence
    and expressly provided that the appellant shall not “remove any of the Evidence
    from the Premises, or alter, deface, discard, conceal or destroy in any manner
    any of the Evidence wherever situate.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, on this record, there was no doubt about the clarity of the orders
    or what they required the appellant to do.  The respondents repeatedly asked
    when and where they could re-image the hard drives.  The appellant failed
    to provide them with access to the hard drives despites numerous requests,
    opportunities and the threat of contempt proceedings between November 16,
    2007 and the hearing of the contempt motion, which was not concluded until
    February 20, 2008.  Where the appellant’s premises were located and where
    the hard drives could be found were matters within the appellant’s knowledge.  Any
    confusion or uncertainty about the location of the hard drives or the place
    where the respondents would attend to re-image them was caused by the appellant’s
    own actions.  The appellant’s failure to comply with the orders cannot, in
    my view, be attributed to any doubt about what the orders required him to
    do.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    was ample evidence to support the motion judge’s finding that the appellant
    had “deliberately interfered with the proper efforts of the plaintiffs to
    exercise the authority and receive the benefit of the court order of Nov.
    16/07.”  That was a finding of fact that is entitled to deference in this
    court, and in any event, I find it difficult to see how the motion judge
    could have come to any other conclusion. In particular, the evidence demonstrated
    that:</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“Where
    the trial judge does not express a particular standard of proof, it will… be
    presumed that the correct standard was applied…
    unless it can be demonstrated by the analysis conducted that the incorrect
    standard was applied”: <i>F.H. v. McDougall</i>, 2008 SCC 53, at para. 54.  Judges “are
    presumed to know the law with which they work day in and day out”: <i>R.
    v. Burns</i>, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 656, at p. 664.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is nothing in the motion judge’s reasons to suggest that he applied a standard
    other than the well-known standard applicable to a finding for contempt – proof
    beyond a reasonable doubt.  Indeed, the unequivocal language he used when
    making the key finding – “the defendant Mr. Corkery deliberately interfered
    with the proper efforts of the plaintiffs” – suggests that he saw no room
    for doubt. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore,
    the motion judge’s reasons must be read as a response to the case as it was
    presented.  As I have already noted, the appellant filed no responding material
    and did not put any of the facts alleged by the respondents in issue.  In
    these circumstances, the motion judge cannot be faulted for omitting to state
    explicitly that he had satisfied himself that contempt had been proven beyond
    a reasonable doubt.</p>
