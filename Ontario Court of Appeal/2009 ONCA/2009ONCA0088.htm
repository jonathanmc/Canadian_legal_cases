    Richmond Hill.  It was purchased in trust for the appellant in April 2007,
    for the purchase price of $2.9 million.  Since that date, the appellant has
    spent approximately $130,000 in renovations, upgrades and repairs.  The property
    is subject to two mortgages:  a first mortgage to the Bank of Montreal initially
    in the amount of $1,537,500, and a second mortgage to the respondent in the
    amount of $910,000.</span></p>

      16, 2008.  As at that date, the amount owing on the second mortgage was
      $830,150.  Pursuant to the notice of sale, the appellant had until June

      2008, the appellant advised the respondent that she had the necessary funds
      to redeem the mortgage.  The respondent refused to accept payment claiming
      that the property had been sold.  When it became apparent that the sale
      had been agreed to before the 35-day notice period under the power of sale
      had expired, the respondent agreed that the sale had to be cancelled and
      that the appellant could redeem.</span></p>

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>DISCUSSION</span></h4>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>1.         Was there evidence of a valid agreement of
      purchase and sale?</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the existence of a valid agreement of purchase and
    sale was a contentious fact.  As a result, the appellant argues, r. 39.01(5)
    requires that proof of this fact must be tendered by a person with direct
    knowledge.  The respondent could not, therefore, rely on his solicitor’s
    affidavit deposing as to his information and belief that a valid agreement
    of purchase and sale had been entered into. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, this ground of appeal must fail.  The evidence before the application
    judge on this point was not limited to the respondent’s solicitor’s affidavit.  There
    was also the evidence of the purchaser, Paiva, who testified that he had
    purchased the property and had paid a $50,000 deposit.  Paiva identified
    a signed copy of the agreement of purchase and sale as accepted by the respondent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether
    or not the evidence of the respondent’s solicitor regarding the sale was
    sufficient, the direct evidence of the purchaser to the effect that he had
    entered into a binding agreement of purchase and sale is clearly adequate
    to establish the sale.  This is particularly so given that there is no evidence
    suggesting that the agreement was invalid or had not been properly executed
    by the parties.</p>
  <h3>2.         Should the sale be invalidated?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    a general rule, the court will not intervene in a mortgagee’s exercise of
    its power of sale.  As set out in Walter M. Traub, ed., <i>Falconbridge</i> <i>on
    Mortgages</i>, 5th ed., looseleaf (
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Aurora,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario: 
    <st1:PersonName w:st="on">
    Canada Law Book, 2008), at para. 35:120.20:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A mortgagee who acts in good faith and without
    fraud will not be prevented from proceeding with a power of sale, even where
    there may have been some breach by the mortgagee in its duty to take all
    reasonable precautions to obtain market value, unless tender is made of the
    entire mortgage amount.  The courts will not interfere with the exercise
    of the power of sale in these circumstances where damages can adequately
    compensate the mortgagor.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>If a mortgagee exercises the power of sale in good
    faith for the purpose of realizing its mortgage debt, without corruption
    or collusion with the purchaser, the court will not interfere, even though
    the sale may be very disadvantageous, unless the price is so low as in itself
    to be evidence of fraud.  [Footnotes omitted.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Therefore,
    once it is determined that a valid agreement of purchase and sale has been
    entered into, a mortgagor seeking to set aside the sale must put forward
    evidence of fraud or bad faith and satisfy the court that the purchaser had
    knowledge or was put on inquiry.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the present case, the appellant has listed a series of facts that, in her
    view, lead to the conclusion that the purchase was a sham and that the purchaser
    is not <i>bona fide</i>.  Other than seeking to deprive the appellant of
    any equity she may have remaining in the property, no motive was advanced
    or is apparent for perpetrating what, in effect, is alleged to be fraud.  If
    it is simply an improvident sale, the mortgagor can later seek damages from
    the mortgagee.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Central
    to the appellant’s case, therefore, is the suggestion that the sale was at
    such a gross undervalue as to constitute evidence of fraud on the mortgagor
    or, at the very least, as to raise a strong suspicion in that regard.  In
    my view, there is no basis on this record for reaching such a conclusion.</p>
  <h3>a)         Was the sale at an undervalue?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant bears the onus of showing that the sale was at such an undervalue
    as to amount to fraud or bad faith.  She relies almost exclusively on the
    fact that the property was sold for $2.45 million when, about two months
    earlier, the respondent had listed the property for $2.91 million.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    list price may be some indication of value, it is in fact only an indication
    of what the respondent thought the property should be initially offered at.  The
    fact that the respondent never expected to receive an offer in that amount
    is apparent from the fact that he accepted an offer to purchase the property
    for $2.45 million only two days after listing it at $2.91 million.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Significantly,
    however, the record contains better evidence of value.  We know that the
    appellant purchased the property for $2.9 million in April 2007, and that
    she spent over $130,000 in renovations, upgrades and repairs to the property,
    bringing the total investment to $3.03 million.  By April 2008, about a year
    after acquiring the property, she defaulted on the mortgages.  Coincident
    with this, an appraisal for the property was obtained for mortgage purposes.  It
    appraised the property at $2.7 million, indicating a range of values from
    $2.558 million to $2.785 million, well below the $3.03 million invested by
    the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appraisal suggests that either the appellant paid more than the market value
    for this property or that property prices in that area declined in value
    from April 2007, to April 2008.  Whichever it is, given the economic situation
    that has developed over the summer and fall of 2008, it is reasonable to
    assume that an update of the appraisal would be more likely to show a continuing
    decline rather than an increase in value.  The fact that the appellant has
    had difficulty obtaining refinancing of the existing mortgages is a further
    indication of the decline in value.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appraisal is also of interest in that it shows that, before being purchased
    by the appellant, the property had been listed on and off for the preceding
    two years.  The $2.9 million paid by the appellant was almost half a million
    dollars less than the $3.388 million at which the property was listed in
    July 2005.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From
    the perspective of the respondent, he has been carrying the mortgages since
    April 2008.  The sale to Paiva was rapid and the price is only $108,000 below
    the low end of values shown in the appraisal obtained some four months earlier.  The
    economic climate is such that the property may well be declining in value
    and the property’s sales history suggests that a quick sale at higher values
    will likely be difficult to secure.  Viewed in this context, I do not consider
    a price of $2.45 million obtained on a power of sale so low as to raise concerns
    or impose on Paiva a duty to inquire.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    concluded that the appellant has failed to meet its onus of showing that
    the sale was at such an undervalue as to be evidence of fraud or bad faith,
    there is simply no explanation of why the respondent and Paiva would engage
    in an alleged fraud and, in my view, the appellant cannot succeed in this
    proceeding.  For completeness, however, I will nonetheless address the appellant’s
    submission that the purchase has all of the earmarks of a sham.</p>
  <h3>b)        Is the purchase a sham?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant maintains that the circumstances surrounding the purchase, including
    how the purchase was concluded, are suspect and the court should conclude
    that the purchase by Paiva is a sham.  Some of the points raised by the appellant
    are that the purchaser: </p>
  <p>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>was
    called around noon and signed the agreement of purchase and sale that afternoon
    without negotiation and without having visited the property or having consulted
    his wife;</p>
  <p>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>was
    unable to adequately explain how the agent came to offer him the property;</p>
  <p>(c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>had
    lived in his current home for 20 years and had not yet listed his home for
    sale;</p>
  <p>(d)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>could
    not remember details about the property; </p>
  <p>(e)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>had
    no idea when the closing would take place;</p>
  <p>(f)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>could
    not adequately explain how he would raise the purchase price given that he
    lived in a neighbourhood where houses on the same street as his were listed
    for sale at only 15-20% of the price he proposed to pay for the new property;
    and</p>
  <p>(g)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>did
    not know if the cheque had cleared his account and did not have his deposit
    cheque certified despite the fact that a previous listing agreement had stipulated
    that deposit cheques should be certified.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would not give effect to this submission.  The application judge considered
    all of these facts and concluded that, while some of the points raised are
    somewhat unusual, there was “no evidence of lack of <i>bona fides</i> that
    would require the intervention of this court … [and] no basis in the evidence
    upon which to set aside the agreement of purchase and sale.”  Before us,
    the appellant has not been able to show any error in the application judge’s
    reasons nor has she established that the application judge’s conclusion on
    this point is unreasonable or unsupported by the evidence.  In my view, the
    application judge’s findings in this regard are entitled to deference and
    ought not to be interfered with.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    any event, while some of the circumstances raised by the appellant are somewhat
    curious or unusual, they cannot support a finding that the purchase was a
    sham.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is clear that Paiva was interested in the property.  About two years earlier,
    Paiva viewed the property, both inside and out, and took his wife to view
    the outside of the property.  It is a reasonable inference that Paiva was
    considering moving to that area or, at least, purchasing a property of that
    size and cost.  In July 2005, the property was listed for $3.388 million
    and by February 2006, the list price had dropped to $2.99 million.  Paiva
    would not, or could not, buy it then at that price but, given his apparent
    interest in the property, it is not at all surprising that two years later
    when he was offered the property at $2.45 million under a power of sale,
    he was prepared to act quickly.  His offer was left open only until 5:00
    p.m. that day, leaving little time to have the deposit cheque certified (although
    there is no indication that certification was a requirement) or to arrange
    a viewing of the property for himself or for his wife.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    for Paiva’s inability to provide details concerning the subject property,
    this is a 22,000 sq. ft. home that he had visited some two years earlier.  It
    is understandable, in my view, that he could not describe the number of bedrooms
    and bathrooms contained in a house of that size.  In any event, as he explained
    in his testimony, he had purchased his current house without even having
    seen the inside.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to how the agent came to offer him the house, Paiva testified that
    he had had a number of social meetings with the agent prior to the purchase
    and, in the course of those meetings, had told the agent about houses he
    had seen, including the subject property.  Paiva’s testimony on this point
    is, admittedly, somewhat confused because at other points in his testimony
    he says he did not discuss the subject property with the agent prior to August
    13.  English is not Paiva’s first language and the confusion may well stem
    from the way the various questions were asked.  The distinction appears to
    be that, prior to the date of purchase, Paiva had done business with other
    real estate agents but had not discussed purchasing a property, including
    the subject property, through this agent.  Up until August 13, his conversations
    had been strictly social. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Concerning
    Paiva’s ability to pay, as I have noted earlier, it is reasonable to assume
    that because Paiva was viewing properties in that price range some two years
    earlier, Paiva was able to raise the necessary funds to purchase them.  Further,
    as Paiva testified, he, together with his company, owned two residential
    properties, a commercial property and had over half a million dollars on
    deposit at various banks.  Paiva has the resources necessary to fund the
    purchase of the subject property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    in light of the fact that the property was sold by power of sale and because
    of the ongoing litigation, it is understandable that a specific closing date
    had not been agreed to and that Paiva chose not to list his current home
    for sale or take steps to obtain a mortgage.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    conclusion on this point, therefore, I see no basis for finding that the
    purchase is a sham.</p>

    appellant was not in funds on August 13.  Despite the appellant’s statement
    that she was in funds when the application was heard, the documents filed
    in support suggest that she was still short by close to $30,000.  Before
    this court, the appellant tendered evidence to the effect that she could
    raise the necessary funds.  The commitments, however, provide among other
    things, that the property is to have an appraised value of not less than
    $2.7 million.  It is unclear, at this point, whether the conditions in the
    letters of commitment can be met.  </p>
