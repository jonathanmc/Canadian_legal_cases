    the Frenchmen’s Creek property and the 550075 property (the first mortgages).  The
    appellants also hold second mortgages over both of these properties as well
    as over a third property, the Old Willoughby property (the second mortgages). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    a result of previous defaults in payment by the respondents on the first
    mortgages, the parties entered into a settlement agreement.  The settlement
    agreement bound together and dealt with all five mortgages.  Section 3 of
    the settlement agreement provided that the respondents would make a series
    of payments to the appellants in respect of the first mortgages.  The settlement
    agreement also stipulated that the respondents would provide the appellants
    with consents to judgment for foreclosure in relation to the first mortgages
    on the Frenchmen’s Creek and 550075 properties to be used by the appellants
    in the event of default by the respondents on the first mortgages.  The parties
    later entered into an amending agreement and, pursuant thereto, s. 3.1 was
    added to the settlement agreement.  Section 3.1 provided that the respondents
    would make a further series of payments to the appellants.  It did not stipulate
    to which mortgages these payments would apply.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    only issue on this appeal is whether the motion judge erred in concluding
    that all of the payments made by the respondents to the appellants, which
    totalled $871,345.95, ought to be applied first to pay down and ultimately
    retire the first mortgages and only thereafter to reduce the second mortgages.  In
    my view, the motion judge did not err in reaching this conclusion.  Accordingly,
    the appeal should be dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    $871,345.95 in payments can be grouped as follows: $630,000 paid by way of
    a series of cheques; and, $241, 345.95 paid out of the proceeds of the judicial
    sale of a portion of the Old Willoughby property, which represents the balance
    of the sale proceeds after a first mortgage held by a non-related party was
    retired.</p>
  <h3><u>The $630,000 paid by a series of cheques </u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    3 of the original settlement agreement provided for a series of monthly payments
    by the respondents to the appellants in respect of the Frenchmen’s Creek
    and 550075 first mortgages.  Payments were to continue until June 15, 2005
    and the balance of the debt was to be retired by June 30, 2005. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents were unable to pay the balance due on the first mortgages by
    June 30.  This led to the parties entering into an amending agreement whereby
    s. 3.1 was added to the settlement agreement.  Although s. 3.1 did not state
    the debt against which these further payments were to be applied, the motion
    judge observed that the context in which s. 3.1 was negotiated, including
    the ongoing threat by the appellants to use the consents to judgment for
    foreclosure in respect of the first mortgages, suggested that the payments
    were intended to “stave off” the appellants’ use of the consents to judgment
    for foreclosure.  Further, the motion judge found that the specific numbering
    of the paragraph added to the settlement agreement, s. 3.1, suggested that
    it was intended to constitute an amendment to s. 3.  Accordingly, the motion
    judge concluded that s. 3.1 should be read as an integral part of the original
    s. 3 of the settlement agreement and that the payments made pursuant thereto
    were to be applied in the same manner as payments made under the original
    s. 3 – i.e. to pay down the first mortgages.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants submit that, because s. 3.1 does not stipulate to which mortgages
    the funds were to be applied and, further, since the respondents failed to
    specify to which debt the sums were to be applied when they made the payments,
    the appellants were not precluded from applying the payments against the
    amounts owing under the second mortgages.  I would not give effect to this
    submission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, considering the context, it was open to the motion judge to make
    the finding she did and I see no basis to interfere with her conclusion.  I
    note also that the series of payments provided for in s. 3.1 is, in effect,
    simply a continuation of the series of payments provided for in s. 3 and,
    logically, should therefore be applied in the same way.</p>
  <h3><u>The Old
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Willoughby proceeds</u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants submit that the $241,349.95 paid to them out of the proceeds of
    the judicial sale of a portion of the Old Willoughby property ought not to
    be applied to pay down the first mortgages over the Frenchmen’s Creek and
    550075 properties.  These monies were the proceeds of a judicial sale and,
    according to the appellants, the question of against which debt the proceeds
    of sale were to be applied is governed by the terms of the interim and final
    reports on sale in the mortgage proceedings involving the Old Willoughby
    property or, alternatively, by s. 6 of the settlement agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    interim report on sale provided that after retirement of the unrelated first
    mortgage, the appellants were entitled to receive the excess funds on account
    of the second mortgage they had registered against the Old Willoughby property.  The
    appellants argue that the motion judge therefore erred in not applying these
    sums to reduce the second mortgage on the Old Willoughby property.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    s. 6 of the settlement agreement provided that the proceeds of sale of any
    of the properties were to be paid to the appellants on account of all five
    mortgages, not just in relation to the first mortgages.  According to the
    appellants, the motion judge’s finding that all of the monies advanced by
    the respondents to the appellants ought to be applied to the first mortgages
    was therefore inconsistent with both the interim and final reports on sale,
    as well as with the terms of the settlement agreement.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    disagree with this submission.  In my view, by entering into a settlement
    agreement that bound all five mortgages together, it is apparent that the
    parties intended that all of the payments made by the respondents to the
    appellants were to be governed by the settlement agreement.  Section 6 of
    the settlement agreement specifically provides that payment to the appellants
    out of the proceeds of sale of any of the properties would be on account
    of all five mortgages.  Although s. 6 does not specify to which mortgage
    or in what proportion a payment received on account of sale was to be applied,
    the motion judge concluded that, in the context, the payment from the Old
    Willoughby sale should be applied to reduce the first mortgages.  On the
    facts of this case, I do not consider her conclusion to be unreasonable. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Shortly
    before receiving the payments from the sale, the appellants demanded from
    the respondents a payment of $250,000, failing which they would use the consents
    to judgment for foreclosure with respect to the first mortgages.  Although
    I acknowledge that the payment of $241,349.95 was made pursuant to a judicial
    sale and would have been paid to the appellants regardless of the demand,
    the amount generated from the sale was nonetheless almost the same as the
    amount that had been demanded.  Other relevant facts are that:</p>
  <p>(a)       all of the payments previously received by the appellants were
    applied in respect of the first mortgages; </p>
  <p>(b)       there was the continuing threat that, if payments were not made,
    the appellants would use the consents to judgment for foreclosure in relation
    to the first mortgages; and</p>
  <p>(c)       section 6 of the settlement agreement provided that proceeds from
    the sale of any of the properties were to be on account of all five mortgages
    and did not stipulate how the allocation among them was to be made.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    a result, it was not unreasonable for the motion judge to conclude that the
    proceeds from the judicial sale of a portion of the Old Willoughby property
    should be applied first to reduce and retire the first mortgages and only
    thereafter to reduce the second mortgages.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    conclusion, I would dismiss the appeal with costs to the respondents fixed
    at $20,000, inclusive of GST and disbursements.</p>
