    Gale, the appellant, is a licensed standardbred driver.  The Ontario Racing
    Commission (the
    “ORC”) is the body established under the <i>Racing Commission Act, 2000</i>,
    S.O. 2000, c. 20, to govern, direct, control and regulate horse-racing in
    the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    province of
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Ontario.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    March 30, 2005, John McEachern, an ORC investigator, asked Mr. Gale to provide
    a urine sample.  Mr. Gale was unable to do so.  Mr. McEachern viewed the
    matter as Mr. Gale having refused to provide a sample.  He also viewed Mr.
    Gale as having spoken to him, using insulting or abusive language.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
    on these events, Inspector McEachern charged Mr. Gale with having violated
    certain of the Rules of Standardbred Racing.  Mr. Gale attended a hearing
    before three race-track judges who found that he had violated the rules in
    question.  He was fined $1500 and suspended for 15 days.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Gale appealed to a full panel of the ORC.  After a full hearing <i>de novo</i>,
    the ORC upheld the decisions of the race-track judges but reduced the fine
    from $1500 to $500. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Gale brought an application for judicial review in which he sought to have
    the ORC decision set aside.  The
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court dismissed the application, finding the ORC’s decision was
    reasonable as “[t]here was ample evidence upon which the Commission could
    come to the decision it did.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the present action against the ORC and Mr. McEachern, Mr. Gale seeks damages
    for negligence, negligent investigation, breach of statutory and/or regulatory
    duties, and intentional infliction of emotional distress.  He alleges that
    in similar situations, the ORC and/or its investigators have allowed standardbred
    drivers who fail to provide a urine sample with an opportunity to provide
    a sample at a later time without charge, suspension or penalty.  He contends
    that the charges against him were laid as punishment for the disrespectful
    comments that he had allegedly made to Inspector McEachern on the day in
    question.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents moved for summary judgment.  In granting the motion, Brockenshire
    J. found that the ORC had dealt with the issues raised in the present action.  He
    held that the action was barred by issue estoppel and the doctrine of abuse
    of process.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Gale appeals to this court, asking that the order below be set aside.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    we see no error in the decision below, we would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    ORC held a full <i>de novo</i> hearing at which the appellant appeared, testified
    and was represented by counsel.  The issues which the appellant seeks to
    litigate are the same issues he raised in defence in the ORC proceedings
    and on which the ORC ruled.  The motion judge was aware of the differences
    between the ORC proceedings and the litigation process, stating that if the
    proceedings before the ORC had been limited strictly to Mr. Gale’s conduct,
    it might have been open to him to launch a civil proceeding dealing with
    the conduct of the inspector.  However, the motion judge found that the defence
    that Mr. Gale mounted initially, and again on appeal to the ORC, turned largely
    on the allegations that the inspector had acted improperly by not granting
    him the right to give a sample on some future date, as he allegedly had done
    for other drivers.  Additionally, there was evidence and argument that the
    inspector had laid the charges against Mr. Gale as punishment for the comments
    that Mr. Gale had allegedly made to the inspector earlier on the day in question.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    short, the motion judge found that the question of the inspector’s good faith
    and the propriety of his actions had been ruled on in the proceedings before
    the ORC.  On the record, it was fully open to the motion judge to make those
    findings.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the circumstances, we agree with the motion judge that to permit the action
    to proceed is an abuse of process.  The doctrine of abuse of process is predicated
    on the notion that litigation ought not be permitted to proceed where it
    would violate such principles as judicial economy, consistency, finality
    and the integrity of the administration of justice:  see <i>Toronto (City)
    v. C.U.P.E. Local 79</i>, [2003]  3 S.C.R. 77 at para. 37.  The same issues
    raised by the appellant in defence at the ORC proceedings would have to be
    relitigated.  And, in order to succeed in the action, the appellant would
    have to displace the determinations made by the ORC and upheld by the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court.  To permit the action to proceed would violate the principles
    identified in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <i>Toronto</i><i> v. C.U.P.E.</i>.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    the extent it is argued that the motion judge erred in failing to exercise
    his residual discretion to allow the action to proceed, we see no basis on
    which to interfere with the exercise of that discretion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the appeal is dismissed with costs to the respondent fixed at $1,000, all
    inclusive.</p>
