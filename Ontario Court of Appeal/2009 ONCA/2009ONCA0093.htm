  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Conviction Appeals</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    appeals arise out of a joint trial of the two appellants, together with a
    third party. The appellant Sabaratnam appeals his convictions on the basis
    that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence and reached an unreasonable
    verdict. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the trial judge was entitled to rely on the combined evidence of
    the false credit cards found on the person of the appellant, which he said
    were always in his possession, together with the evidence of all the equipment
    found in the home for stealing credit card personal information and for manufacturing
    false credit cards, to infer knowledge of and participation by this appellant
    in the crimes charged. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the trial judge may have misapprehended some minor details in his description
    of the evidence, they were not material and did not affect the verdict.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant Prathapan submits that it was not open to the trial judge to infer
    from the evidence of all the equipment and documents relating to the manufacture
    of false credit cards found in the home that she had the requisite knowledge
    for a finding of possession. We disagree. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge rejected as incredible the unequivocal evidence of the appellant
    that she only noticed objects that belonged to herself or her husband in
    her home. Having done so, the trial judge was entitled to infer, based on
    the number and location in the house of the items found, that the appellant
    had the requisite knowledge of their presence to ground a finding of possession. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeals against conviction are therefore dismissed.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Sentence
      Appeals</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to sentence, we see no basis on which to interfere with the sentence
    imposed on Sabaratnam. We are not persuaded that the trial judge erred in
    principle, including in his decision not to impose a conditional sentence,
    or in his consideration of the appropriate sentencing factors in fashioning
    his sentence for this appellant. It is not suggested that the sentence imposed
    is unfit. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    particular, on this record, we do not agree that the sentence imposed offended
    the parity principle or that the restitution order is unsustainable. Sabaratnam’s
    brother pled guilty to reduced charges and received mitigation credit as
    a result. This important factor does not apply to Sabaratnam. With respect
    to the restitution order, there was some evidence before the trial judge
    of Sabaratnam’s ability to make restitution. Moreover, this appellant was
    found guilty of conspiracy in relation to a significant financial fraud.
    In these circumstances, the restitution order imposed against him was reasonable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    we reach a different conclusion in respect of part of the sentence imposed
    on&nbsp;Prathapan. Her counsel argues that the restitution order imposed
    on her is unsupportable on the evidence, especially given the absence of
    any evidence that she benefited from the illegal conduct in issue. We agree,
    although for somewhat different reasons, that the restitution order against
    her must be set aside.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, there was no evidential basis to support this order against&nbsp;Prathapan,
    the 26-year-old mother of two young children who was not and appears never
    to have been employed outside the home, at least in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    . Moreover, it is undisputed that her husband was the sole income earner
    in the family. In these circumstances, absent any proof of ability by this
    appellant to discharge the restitution order, the restitution order imposed
    is unsustainable. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Therefore,
    leave to appeal sentence is granted with respect to both appellants. Sabaratnam’s
    sentence appeal is dismissed. Prathapan’s sentence appeal is allowed in part,
    by setting aside the restitution order imposed. In all other respects, her
    sentence remains in full force and effect.</p>
