    appellant was convicted of five counts of indecent assault and one count
    of sexual assault after a trial before a superior court judge sitting without
    a jury.  The offences were committed from 1974 to 1983 and all involved adolescent
    male victims. The appellant was given a global sentence of 9.5 years.  He
    appeals the convictions and seeks leave to appeal the sentence.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge erred by ruling that the evidence
    on each count was admissible as similar fact evidence on all other counts.  The
    appellant argues that the similarities identified by the trial judge reflected
    only generic details that one might expect to see in all types of sexual
    offences and that the similar fact ruling reveals an error in principle sufficient
    to justify appellate intervention.</p>

    trial judge applied the correct legal test for the admissibility of similar
    fact evidence as mandated by <i>R. v. Handy</i>, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 908.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his ruling, the trial judge identified the following elements in the evidence
    that, in his view, rendered the evidence on each count admissible on all
    other counts:</p>
  <p><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>proximity
    in time – the appellant engaged in sexual contact with one or more complainant
    over a 10 year period with no gap;</p>
  <p><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    sexual acts were similar in their detail and all involved the abuse of young
    males starting at age 14 or less;</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>there
    were a large number of incidents sufficient to support a finding of situation-specific
    behaviour;</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    similarities established a <i>modus operandi</i> of grooming and creating
    surprise sexual opportunities to molest young males:</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
&quot;Courier New&quot;'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>all
    five complainants participated in weekend visits to the appellant’s farm
    and four of the five were sexually assaulted there;</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
&quot;Courier New&quot;'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>in
    each of the five cases, the appellant gained the trust of the complainant’s
    parents, or, through his Big Brother connections, arranged to have the boys
    entrusted to his care overnight;</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
&quot;Courier New&quot;'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>all
    five complainants were assaulted late at night while sleeping;</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:&quot;Courier New&quot;;
&quot;Courier New&quot;'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>there
    was little or no discussion between the appellant and the complainants before,
    after or during the sexual acts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge considered the possibility of collusion between the complainants
    and found that while there was evidence of opportunity for collusion, there
    was no evidence to indicate that there had in fact been any collusion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is well-established that a similar fact ruling is entitled to a high degree
    of deference and that an appellate court will not intervene with the trial
    judge’s ruling unless the trial judge’s analysis is
    “unreasonable, or is undermined by…legal error or misapprehension of material
    evidence”: R. v. James (2006), 213 C.C.C. (3d) 235 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) at para. 33; <i>R. v. Shearing</i>, [2002] 3 S.C.R. 33, at para. 73.  We
    see no such legal error or misapprehension of material evidence in this case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, it was open to the trial judge to conclude that these similarities
    went beyond the generic similarities one might expect to find in relation
    to any sexual offence. It was also open to him to conclude that the fact
    that some of the complainants alleged a single incident of abuse while others
    alleged repeated abuse did not make a material difference given the number
    of features common to each allegation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    note as well that <i>Handy</i> states that admissibility is conditioned by
    the issue to which the evidence is directed.  Here, the evidence went not
    to identity, where distinctive features amounting to a
    “signature” may be required, but rather to the <i>actus
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    reus</i>, where less cogent similarities may render the evidence admissible.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    we observe that this was a judge alone trial on a multi-count indictment.
    There was no severance application and it was inevitable that the judge deciding
    the case would hear all of the evidence.  While this, of course, does not
    by itself render the evidence admissible across all counts, it significantly
    reduces the risk of prejudice.  Moreover, in his reasons, the trial judge
    properly identified the permitted use of similar fact evidence and cautioned
    himself against prohibited lines of reasoning.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    we would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p><b><i>(b)       Credibility findings</i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge failed to provide adequate reasons
    for rejecting the appellant’s evidence as well as the evidence of the appellant’s
    father.  The trial judge relied on the fact that the appellant had deliberately
    lied regarding theft allegations against one of the complainants as his primary
    reason for rejecting the appellant’s evidence. In oral argument before us,
    particular emphasis was placed on the trial judge’s rejection of the father’s
    evidence because his account of a meeting involving him, the appellant and
    one of the complainants regarding theft allegations was “inconsistent with
    the proven facts and with the evidence of his own son”.  The father was not
    specifically cross-examined on that evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the failure to cross-examine the father on this point certainly raises an
    issue of fairness, it remains the case that the father’s evidence on this
    point was inconsistent with that of the appellant and with the other evidence
    at trial.  In our view, there was an evidentiary foundation for the trial
    judge’s findings that the appellant’s father had not told the truth regarding
    the theft allegations and that, in general terms, he had “shaded the facts
    in an attempt to bolster his son’s case.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    credibility findings are often difficult to explain and are the paradigm
    case for deference.  The Supreme Court of Canada has directed that intervention
    by appellate courts will be “rare” and that reasons for credibility findings
    need not consider or answer each and every argument or each and every piece
    of evidence: <i>R. v. R.E.M.</i>, 2008 SCC 51. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    read as a whole, we are not persuaded that the trial judge’s reasons for
    his credibility findings reveal any deficiency that would warrant or justify
    appellate intervention.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>SENTENCE APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant raises, for the first time in oral argument, the submission that
    the trial judge miscalculated the sentence he had imposed.  The trial judge
    first sentenced the appellant to concurrent terms of eight years on counts
    one, two, and five.  He then said the following with respect to the remaining
    counts: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In addition, sir, you are sentenced on each of
    counts three and four to six months in jail <i>consecutive to each other
    and consecutive to the sentence on count one…</i> with respect to count six… you
    are sentenced to six months in jail <i>consecutive to the sentence in count
    one</i>.  The global sentence then on all six counts is 9 1/2 years.” (Emphasis
    added).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that, as the six-month sentence in relation to count six
    was specified as being only consecutive to the sentence on count one, it
    must run concurrent with respect to the six months imposed on the other counts. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    disagree.  There was no reason for the trial judge to distinguish or to impose
    a different sentence on count six than on counts three and four.  In our
    view, it is apparent that the trial judge intended to impose a global sentence
    of 9 1/2 years and that his failure to state that the sentence on count six
    was to run consecutively to the sentences imposed on counts three and four
    was merely a slip.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the appellant submits that the sentence lies outside the accepted range.  Again,
    we are unable to agree with this submission.  The appellant, in a position
    of trust, sexually abused five adolescent males over a period of 10 years.  The
    acts of abuse included forced anal intercourse.  The sexual assaults were
    regular and persistent in relation to two victims.  This brings the sentence
    within the range identified in <i>R. v. D.D.</i> (2002), 58 O.R. (3d) 788
    (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the conviction appeal is dismissed, leave to appeal sentence is granted but
