  <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant was convicted of the following offence:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><b>Kevin Martin KOHL</b> on or about the 3<span style='font-family:&quot;Times New \(W1\)&quot;;
'>rd</span> day of Nov ember in the year 2006 at the City of St. Catharines in
    the said region did, without lawful authority and knowing that another person,
    namely Susan DICK, was harassed or recklessly as to whether that person was
    harassed, engage in threatening conduct directed at that person and cause
    the said Susan DICK to reasonably fear for personal safety, contrary to Section
    264, subsection (3) of the Criminal Code of Canada.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant, a complete stranger to the complainant, jumped out from behind
    some bushes and confronted her, blocked her way in a threatening and frightening
    manner while she was jogging, and confronted her without either touching
    her or speaking to her.  He then chased her down the street as she attempted
    to escape from him.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant was sentenced to three years in the penitentiary.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    case raises the issue of whether a single incident of this nature can constitute
    harassment under s. 264(3)(d) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  It also raises
    the issue of whether a sentence of three years in the penitentiary is a fit
    sentence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal from conviction.  I would
    allow the sentence appeal and reduce the sentence to two years in the reformatory
    followed by a period of probation.  </p>
  <h2>THE FACTS</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the early evening hours of November 3, 2006, the complainant, who was training
    to compete in the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    New York City marathon two days later, was jogging on a residential street
    in Port Dalhousie,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario.  She was passed on the roadway by the appellant who was running
    with what the complainant described as a “loping, almost gorilla-like” gait.  It
    was dark and the street lamps were on.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    the appellant ran ahead of her, the complainant noticed that he looked back
    at her over his shoulder on four occasions and then disappeared from view
    behind some bushes.  She was alarmed and frightened by this conduct.  Within
    a very short period of time, the appellant came out from behind the bushes
    and confronted her. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant stood in the middle of the road and faced the complainant with
    his arms outstretched.  She testified that, “it was a threatening stance
    as if he was trying to block my way.  It was clear I was not going to make
    it past him.”  She was alarmed as the appellant came towards her in a very
    threatening manner.  The complainant stopped running.  The complainant took
    two steps forward to see what the appellant would do and he came towards
    her – she panicked and ran away in the opposite direction.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant ran after the complainant and continued to pursue her.  The complainant
    ran as fast as she could.  However, the appellant was gaining on her.  The
    complainant looked for a house in which she could seek a safe haven.  She
    saw a house with its porch light on and a car in the driveway.  She ran up
    the steps and rang the doorbell.  As she waited for someone to come to the
    door, the appellant stood at the end of the driveway and stared at her.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    owner of the house, Robert Montgomery, answered the door and after the complainant
    explained her plight, he let her into the house.  Mr. Montgomery observed
    that the complainant was very, very scared when he opened the door.  While
    she was comforted by Mr. Montgomery’s wife, Mr. Montgomery went outside to
    speak to the appellant.  Mr. Montgomery noticed the appellant standing in
    front of a neighbour’s house – two doors away.  Mr. Montgomery approached
    the appellant and asked him why he was there.  The appellant said that he
    was waiting for his girlfriend to pick him up.  Mr. Montgomery then asked
    why he was on that street.  The appellant responded that he had observed
    a neighbour of Mr. Montgomery, whom he knew, come home in his car and he
    wanted to talk to him.  The appellant then walked into the neighbour’s yard
    and stood under a tree.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Montgomery described the appellant as appearing very disconnected.  There
    was no emotional content to what he was saying.  Mr. Montgomery thought the
    appellant was either on drugs or that he was mentally challenged in some
    way.  Mr. Montgomery went back to his house and called the police.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    took 20 to 25 minutes for the police officer, David Sinclair, of the Niagara
    Regional Police, to arrive.  Constable Sinclair observed that the complainant
    had been crying.  She appeared to be shaking somewhat.  Her voice was very
    shaky.  After the complainant and Mr. Montgomery recounted what had happened,
    Constable Sinclair left the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Montgomery residence to look for the appellant.  The officer did not find
    the appellant and returned to the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Montgomery residence.  It was arranged that Constable Sinclair would drive
    the complainant home.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When
    the complainant got into the police car, she noticed that the appellant was
    standing at the end of the street.  The police officer drove his car to where
    the appellant was standing – near the bushes where he had first confronted
    the complainant.  The complainant identified the appellant to the police
    officer.  The police officer told the complainant to run back to the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Montgomery residence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    officer arrested the appellant for criminal harassment.  The officer cautioned
    the appellant and advised him of his right to counsel.  The appellant responded: “I
    am sorry with that thing with the girl tonight.  It won’t happen again.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Montgomery drove the complainant home. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Throughout
    the confrontation between the complainant and the appellant, the appellant
    did not speak a single word.  The complainant was 40 years old, 5 foot 5
    inches tall, and weighed 125 pounds.  The appellant was 32 years old.  Witnesses
    at trial estimated his height was between 5 foot 11 inches to 6 foot 4 inches
    and his weight between 190 pounds to 220 pounds.  He was a big man.</p>
  <h2>THE REASONS OF THE TRIAL JUDGE</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Defence
    counsel at trial conceded that an incident may be characterized as a single
    act and constitute harassment.  However, he argued that the Crown had failed
    to prove any of the elements of the offence as described by the Alberta Court
    of Appeal in <i>R. v. Sillipp</i> (1997), 120 C.C.C. (3d) 384.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Sillipp</i>,
    Berger J.A. described the elements of the offence of criminal harassment
    at para. 18:</p>

    Code</i>.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It

    must be established that the accused who engaged in such conduct knew that
    the complainant was harassed or was reckless or wilfully blind as to whether
    the complainant was harassed;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    must be established that the conduct caused the com-plainant to fear for
    her safety or the safety of anyone known to her; and</p>

    must be established that the complainant’s fear was, in all of the circumstances,
    reasonable.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>The trial judge, after reviewing
    the evidence in some detail, concluded that the Crown had established beyond
    a reasonable doubt all of the elements of the offence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge sentenced the appellant to a three year penitentiary term.</p>
  <h2>ISSUES ON THE CONVICTION APPEAL</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant raises the following grounds of appeal from conviction:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge erred in her analysis of whether the appellant’s actions amounted
    to threatening conduct under s. 264(2)(d) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge erred in finding that the complainant was harassed when the single
    incident carried no real future prospect of the continuing torment of the
    complainant.</p>
  <h2>ANALYSIS</h2>
  <h2>(i)        Did the trial judge err in her analysis of whether the appellant’s
    actions amounted to threatening conduct under s. 264(2)(d) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>?</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for the appellant relies upon the decision of this court in <i>R. v. Burns</i> 2008
    ONCA 6 (CanLII).  Burns was a police officer in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    North Bay and was convicted of criminal harassment.  The court’s endorsement
    on the harassment charge is contained in three  short paragraphs and reads
    as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[2]       To establish harassment under s. 264(2)(d)
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, the Crown had to establish that the appellant
    engaged in “threatening conduct”.  We accept the definition of threatening
    conduct given in <i>R. v. George</i> 2002 YKCA 2 (CanLII), (2002), 162 C.C.C.
    (3d) 337 (Y.T.C.A.) at para. 39 that, in order to meet the objectives of
    s. 264, the threatening conduct must amount to a “tool of intimidation which
    is designed to instill a sense of fear in the recipient”.  The impugned conduct
    is to be viewed objectively, with due consideration for the circumstances
    in which they took place, and with regard to the effects those acts had on
    the recipient.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[3]       In brief, the conduct in question is as
    follows.  The appellant and the complainant knew one another but had virtually
    no contact in the three years prior to the incident.  The incident took place
    in broad daylight in downtown
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    North Bay while the complainant was walking down
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Main Street with her five-year old daughter, after having left a bank.  The
    appellant was dressed in full police uniform and also on foot on
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Main Street.  He wolf-whistled at the complainant, said “nice butt” or “nice
    ass” and then, after the complainant sped up to get away from him, called
    out “are those pants painted on”.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[4]       While the appellant’s conduct was clearly
    inappro-priate and unwanted, we do not see the incident as amounting to threatening
    conduct within the meaning of those words in s. 264(2)(d).  Although the
    complainant justifiably felt upset and scared by the appellant’s conduct,
    viewed objectively, we do not see it as rising to the level of a “tool of
    intimidation designed to instill a sense of fear”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for the appellant submits that the trial judge did not have the benefit of <i>Burns</i> and
    failed to consider whether the appellant’s conduct was a “tool of intimidation
    designed to instil a sense of fear” in the complainant.  Counsel relies upon
    comments made by the trial judge to the effect that she could not discern
    what the intention of the appellant was in respect of the complainant.  In
    particular, he cites the following observation of the trial judge in her
    reasons for judgment:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Left without explanation, the court, as was the
    complainant in this matter must have been left to surmise, conjecture or
    assume what were the intentions of the accused by his actions, which may
    not be discernable, nor are we certain they were discernable by the accused
    himself at the time.</p>

    appellant reasons from the above that the trial judge must have had a reasonable
    doubt whether the appellant’s conduct appeared objectively to have been designed
    to instil fear.  I disagree.  All the trial judge is saying in the above
    excerpt from her reasons is that, because the appellant never spoke to the
    complainant, it was not possible to discern what he was <i>about to do</i> when
    he blocked her way and chased her down the street.  That said, it does not
    weaken the case in support of a conviction for criminal harassment.  His
    conduct alone, without the spoken word, was more than sufficient to establish
    threatening conduct within the meaning of s. 264(2)(d) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>.  Indeed, it is clear from the evidence of the complainant that
    she feared for her safety.  Her response of turning and running in search
    of a safe haven supports her testimony.  </p>

  <h2>(ii)      Did the trial judge err in finding that the complainant was harassed

    torment of the complainant?</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for the appellant submits that, for a single incident to constitute harass-ment
    under s. 264 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> such incident must be linked to
    past conduct or “carry with it the threat of future contact.”  He relies
    upon this court’s reasons for judgment in <i>R. v. Kosikar</i> (1999), 138
    C.C.C. (3d) 217 at para. 28 where Goudge J.A. said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Moreover, while in this case the prior contact is
    important proof of the consequence caused to the complainant, it is possible
    to imagine a case where the complainant’s feeling harassed would be proven
    not through the context of prior contact but by evidence of a single incident
    that carried the real future prospect of the continuing tormenting of the
    complainant.  In other words, prior contact may not be the only way of proving
    the necessary consequence of a single act of threatening conduct.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Kosikar</i>,
    the conduct relied upon by the Crown was an abusive letter sent after a previous
    conviction for harassing the complainant.  The issue before the court was
    whether a single incident (the letter) could found a conviction under s.
    264, given the harassment element of the offence.  Goudge J.A. concluded
    that a single incident could be sufficient to support a conviction.  He said
    at para. 20:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>As a matter of statutory interpretation I do not
    think that s.&nbsp;264(2)(<i>d</i>) is limited to repeated threatening conduct
    to the exclusion of a single threatening act.  Parliament expressly required
    repeated conduct in defining the prohibited acts in s.&nbsp;264(2)(<i>a</i>)
    and (<i>b</i>).  The absence of such a qualification in s.&nbsp;264(2)(<i>d</i>)
    strongly suggests to me a legislative intention not to confine that prohibition
    to repeated threatening conduct, but to encompass a single threatening act
    as well. </p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>Goudge J.A. went on to say that
    the threatening conduct need not be repetitious provided that it produces
    in the complainant a state of being harassed.  Relying in part on <i>Sillipp</i>,
    Goudge J.A. concluded that a state of being harassed involved the complainant
    being “tormented, troubled, worried continually or chronically, plagued,
    bedevilled and badgered”.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    a more recent judgment of this court, <i>R. v. O’Connor</i>, 2008 ONCA 2006
    (CanLII), Simmons J.A. appears to carry the analysis in <i>Kosikar</i> a
    step further.  At paras. 4 and 5, Simmons J.A. said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In <i>Kosikar</i>, evidence of prior contact between
    the accused and the complainant was used to show that as the consequence
    of a letter the complainant felt harassed.  However, Goudge J.A. also stated, “it
    is possible to imagine a case where the complainant’s feeling harassed would
    be proven … by evidence of a single incident that carried the real future
    prospect of the continuing tormenting of the complainant.”</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>On the facts of this case, in my view, it was open
    to the trial judge to find that the complainant was harassed both because
    the appellant’s behaviour during the incident was persistent and because
    the incident occurred while the appellant was subject to a probation order
    requiring that he have no contact with the complainant.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    would adopt the approach taken by the court in <i>O’Connor</i>.  Even though
    the conduct in this case occurred over a relatively short period of time
    and there was no prior contact, it was highly threatening and persistent.  The
    appellant jumped out of the bushes, blocked the progress of the complainant
    with outstretched arms, chased her down the road where she fled from him,
    then stood outside the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Montgomery residence and stared at her.  The trial judge properly described
    the appellant’s conduct as persistent:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>When the persistence of his actions are taken into
    consider-ation with the fact that during this time he spoke no words to ease
    what obviously from his apology appeared to him to have an unfavourable effect
    on the complainant, his actions may, as previously described, appear as threatening
    conduct…</p>

    the encounter with the appellant, brief as it was, the complainant reasonably
    feared for her safety and was clearly in a state of being harassed.</p>

    counsel for the Crown nor counsel for the appellant was able to provide us
    with any authorities which come close to the facts before the court.  Counsel
    for the appellant referred us to four “stalking” cases where the accused
    persons had engaged in harassing conduct after prior relationships had been
    terminated: <i>R. v. Bates</i> (2000), 146 C.C.C. (3d) 321 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>

    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ); <i>R. v. De La Cruz</i> (2003), 174 C.C.C. (3d) 554 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) and <i>R. v. White</i> (2003), 176 C.C.C. (3d) 396 (Ont. C.A.).  The four
    accused received medium to high range reformatory sentences.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    facts in each of these cases are very different from the facts in this case.  Suffice
    it to say that the conduct of the accused in each case occurred over a much
    longer period of time, was far more serious than the conduct in this case,
    and included convictions for other offences.  Also, the circumstances of
    each of the accused is very different.  Three of the four (Bates, De La Cruz
    and White) had no prior criminal record.</p>

    a range of sentencing from the criminal harassment cases.</p>

    for the Crown in this appeal makes the point that “[c]riminal harassment
    can be committed in so many different ways that it defies the range setting
    exercise.”  This observation is taken directly from <i>R. v. Linden</i> (2000),
    147 C.C.C. (3d) 299 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">

    agree with the Crown’s submission that the observation applies to criminal
    harassment cases.  </p>

    for the Crown submits that the focus here should be on specific deterrence
    and protection of the public.  He argues that the court needs to send a message
    to the appellant and to the public that conduct of this nature towards a
    vulnerable victim will not be tolerated.  He further submits that the appellant’s
    criminal record including convictions for violent crime leads to the conclusion
    that we should not interfere with the three year penitentiary sentence.</p>

    accept that the appellant needs to be incarcerated for a significant period
    of time for this offence, given his criminal record.  However, I do not agree
    that the trial judge gave sufficient weight to the nature of the offence.  I
    conclude that a three year penitentiary term is disproportionate to the conduct
    underlying the offence and therefore manifestly unfit.  I believe that a
    sentence of two years plus a three year term of probation will send the correct
    message to the appellant and to the public.  The appellant is still relatively
    young, and a lengthy period of probation with appropriate conditions may,
    finally, break the cycle of release from jail, drug abuse and return to jail.</p>
