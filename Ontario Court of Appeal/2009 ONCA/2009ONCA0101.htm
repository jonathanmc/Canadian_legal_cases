    Im, is a medical doctor.  In July 2004, he was charged with two counts of
    sexual assault that arose out of allegations made by two of his patients.  The
    Crown elected to proceed summarily and the trial took place before a judge
    of the Ontario Court of Justice.  On December 13, 2005, the trial judge convicted
    Dr. Im of sexually assaulting one of his patients.  He was acquitted on the
    second count involving a different patient.   </p>

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
page-break-after:avoid'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    trial, Dr. Im and the complainant were the only witnesses who testified.  Each
    gave a very different version of events.  The complainant testified that,
    while Dr. Im was checking her eyes, he rubbed his waist and front area, an
    area she then identified as his “private” and his “penis”, into her knees.   She
    added that she could feel that that part of his body was hard.  According
    to the complainant’s evidence, when Dr. Im finished and turned around, she
    noticed that he had an erection.  In his evidence, Dr. Im denied that he
    intentionally touched the complainant and further denied that he had an erection.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that a sexual assault
    had occurred as described by the complainant and convicted Dr. Im. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Before
    the summary conviction appeal court, Dr. Im alleged that the trial judge
    failed to address inconsistencies in the complainant’s evidence that were
    apparent when her trial testimony was compared to her statement to the police
    and that the trial judge failed to give adequate reasons for believing the
    complainant’s testimony.  In the result, Dr. Im argued that the trial judge’s
    reasons were insufficient as they did not adequately explain the foundation
    for the conviction.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    summary conviction appeal judge found that the trial judge’s reasons did
    not fail to address the inconsistencies as alleged by Dr. Im.  Dr. Im’s central
    argument was addressed by the summary conviction appeal court judge, as follows:</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;'>In my view these reasons
    read as a whole are sufficient to understand the reason why the trial judge
    accepted the evidence of the complainant.  With respect to the defence submission
    that the evidence of the complainant differed from her video statement, it
    is evident from the reasons that the trial judge accepted the video statement
    that she was touched by the stomach as not inconsistent with evidence that
    she was touched by the waist/genital area, given where she was pointing in
    the video.  It is evident that the trial judge did not consider that the
    video statement was inconsistent with the evidence given at trial that she
    was rubbed by the waist/genital area, or that the accused was rubbing against
    her.  She further considered that English was not the complainant’s first
    language.  The trial judge dealt directly with the issue of whether the complaint
    could have been mistaken about whether she later saw an erection and accepted
    that as a mature woman, and a mother of four children, she would not have
    been mistaken.  The trial judge also noted the circumstances of the preceding
    conversation, that close contact was avoidable for the purposes of the examination,
    that the complainant did not have any questions or ambiguity about the nature
    of the touching at the time of the examination, and that she complained to
    police immediately.  The trial judge did not specially comment on the fact
    that the complainant testified at trial that what she felt was hard but failed
    to mention that it was hard on the video statement.  However, the trial judge
    did not specifically refer at all to the evidence at trial that what was
    rubbing against her was hard.  It appears that the trial judge did not rely
    upon that specific evidence but rather relied upon all the other circumstances
    noted above.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    primary inconsistency that Dr. Im alleged the trial judge failed to address
    related to the complainant’s videotaped complaint to the police.  On the
    video of her police statement, the complainant said that Dr. Im rubbed her
    with his stomach and did not mention his penis.  However, the summary conviction
    appeal judge concluded that the trial judge’s reasons addressed this issue – the
    trial judge concluded, from the video, that there was no inconsistency in
    the complainant’s evidence.  When the complainant spoke about Dr. Im’s stomach
    in the video statement, and about what part of his body had touched her,
    she illustrated by pointing to the waist and lower area.  Further, in the
    video, the complainant put her hands at the exact same height when describing
    where she saw his erection.     </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    summary conviction appeal judge concluded that the reasons, read as a whole,
    sufficiently explained why the trial judge accepted the complainant’s evidence
    and ultimately was persuaded, beyond a reasonable doubt, that a sexual assault
    had taken place. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this court, Dr. Im renewed the arguments advanced before the summary conviction
    appeal judge.  He also advanced a new argument that the trial judge erred
    in the application of <i>R. v. W.(D.)</i>, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742,<i> </i>thereby
    failing to give Dr. Im the benefit of a reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
page-break-after:avoid;'><b>III.       ANALYSIS </b></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    history I have just described is similar to that outlined in <i>R. v. R.(R.) </i>(2008),
    90 O.R. (3d) 641, a recent decision of this court.  In that case, Doherty
    J.A. examined the scope of appellate review contemplated by s. 839(1) of
    the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  He concluded that a second appeal in summary conviction
    proceedings should be the exception and not the rule.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Doherty
    J.A. concluded that access to this court should be limited to cases in which
    the applicant can demonstrate exceptional circumstances justifying a second
    level of appeal.  He went on to identify two categories of cases in which
    leave to appeal may be granted.  First, if an issue raised has significance
    to the administration of justice beyond the particular case, then leave to
    appeal may be granted if the grounds are at least arguable.  Second, where
    the merits appear to be very strong, leave to appeal may be granted even
    if the issues have no general importance, especially if the conviction in
    issue is serious and the applicant is facing a significant deprivation of
    his or her liberty. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Neither
    circumstance exists here. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    while the issues raised are clearly important to those involved – particularly
    Dr. Im – this case does not raise an issue of significance to the general
    administration of criminal justice.  The arguments raised are based on well-settled
    legal principles.  This court is essentially being asked to use the same
    tools to reach a different conclusion than did the courts below.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    in my view, the merits of the appeal from the decision of the summary conviction
    appeal court are far from strong: that court addressed Dr. Im’s concerns
    about the trial judge’s reasons.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>My
    view of the merits of the appeal is supported by the Supreme Court of Canada’s
    recent decision in <i>R. v. R.E.M.</i> (2008), 235 C.C.C. (3d) 290, in which
    the court considered the sufficiency of a trial judge’s reasons.  The case
    turned primarily on credibility findings which led to the accused’s conviction
    of three offences relating to a series of sexual assaults.  The British Columbia
    Court of Appeal allowed the accused’s appeal with respect to two counts on
    the basis that the trial judge’s reasons were deficient, essentially for
    the same reasons Dr. Im advances before this court – failing to give adequate
    reasons for conclusions as to credibility, and in particular, in failing
    to address inconsistencies in the complainant’s testimony.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    allowing the appeal and restoring the convictions, the Supreme Court of Canada
    provided guidance on the role of appellate courts in assessing the sufficiency
    of reasons.  At para. 15, the court explained that a trial judge’s reasons “must
    be sufficient to fulfill their functions of explaining why the accused was
    convicted or acquitted, providing public accountability and permitting effective
    appellate review.”  The reasons will not be found to have deprived the appellant
    of the right to meaningful appellate review if, considered as a whole, in
    the context of the evidentiary record, the live issues, and the submissions
    of counsel, they show why the judge decided as he or she did. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    case, like <i>R.E.M.,</i> turned on credibility.  The trial judge found the
    complainant to be more credible than Dr. Im.  Even though there were problematic
    aspects of the evidence of both witnesses, the reasons show that on the important
    points, the trial judge accepted the complainant’s evidence and rejected
    that of Dr. Im, and why.  Put simply, the reasons disclose the foundation
    of the conviction, as the Supreme Court of Canada stated they must in <i>R.E.M.</i>  Consequently,
    I do not regard the appeal as particularly meritorious. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Further,
    quoting Doherty J.A. in <i>R.(R.)</i>, I am not persuaded that the impact
    of this conviction on Dr. Im would amount to a “significant deprivation”
    of his liberty.  He received a lenient disposition in the form of a six-month
    conditional sentence followed by a period of probation.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    considering the proposed ground of appeal relating to the application of <i>W.(D.)</i>,
    I would note that in <i>R.(R.)</i>, it was held that “[g]enerally speaking,
    this court should not entertain legal arguments that were not advanced at
    the first level of appeal.” No justification was advanced nor, in these circumstances,
    is there one that warrants this court’s consideration of this new argument.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Having
    regard to the nature of the arguments raised, the merit of those arguments
    and the impact of the conviction on Dr. Im, I do not regard this as an appropriate
    case for granting leave to appeal.</p>

    disagree with the conclusion reached by my colleague, Epstein J.A.  I would
    allow the application for leave to appeal.  I would also allow the appeal
    and order a new trial for the brief reasons that follow.</p>

    J.A. in <i>R. v. R.(R.)</i> does not purport to define with precision the
    circumstances under which leave to appeal should be granted from a decision
    of a summary conviction appeal court judge.  Indeed, at para. 37 of his reasons
    for judgment, Doherty J.A. said that,
    “[t]here is no single litmus test that can identify all cases in which leave
    [to appeal] should be granted.”  </p>

    J.A. suggests that where the proposed appeal does not engage issues of legal
    significance for the administration of justice, but the merits “appear very
    strong”, it is appropriate to grant leave to appeal – particularly “if the
    convictions in issue are serious and the applicant is facing a significant
    deprivation of his or her liberty.”  A conviction for sexual assault is always
    serious.  We were not provided with the details of the conditional sentence
    of six months and three years probation.  However, undoubtedly, such sentence
    involved a deprivation of the appellant’s liberty.  Whether it was a “significant
    deprivation”, I cannot say without the relevant information.  However, I
    do not read Doherty J.A.’s reasons as suggesting that leave to appeal should
    be denied if there has been a failure to do justice in the courts below.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, leave to appeal should be granted in this case in order to have
    the defence position, concerning the reliability of the complainant’s evidence,
    considered by the court – otherwise justice will not have been done to the
    appellant.  I have no difficulty in concluding that the merits of the proposed
    appeal are very strong.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Central
    to the defence position at trial was that the complainant’s evidence was
    unreliable because of significant inconsistencies between her evidence at
    trial and her statement given to the police a year earlier and two weeks
    after the alleged assault.  For example, the complainant admitted in cross-examination
    that she never said to the police that the appellant’s
    “privates”, “groin”, “penis” or anything “hard” touched her.  The summary
    conviction appeal court judge erred in failing to appreciate that these inconsistencies
    were not addressed in any way by the trial judge.  The summary conviction
    appeal court judge concluded that the trial judge had adequately addressed
    the inconsistencies.  With respect, I simply cannot agree.  The trial judge
    did not refer to the complainant’s admissions referred to above.  Significantly,
    she did not even use the word
    “inconsistencies” in her reasons for judgment.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge and the summary conviction appeal court judge both made reference
    to the complainant’s hand gesture on the video of her police statement, <i>i.e.</i> the
    pointing of her hands “to the waist and lower area.”  The trial judge went
    on to say that “this Court can take note that directly beneath the stomach
    are the genitals.”  There is an implied suggestion in the reasons of the
    summary conviction appeal court judge that this observation is relevant to
    resolving the inconsistencies in the complainant’s evidence.  I do not agree.  The
    fact that the genitals can be said to be directly beneath the stomach cannot
    possibly be said to resolve in any meaningful way the inconsistencies in
    the appellant’s sworn evidence.  Moreover, what is very clear from watching
    the video is that the complainant was placing her hands over her stomach
    and nothing else.  In my view, one simply cannot take from this gesture that
    she was intending to convey the notion that the appellant had rubbed his
    penis against her knees.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    summary conviction appeal court judge relied upon the following statement
    of Rosenberg J.A. in <i>R. v. Stark</i> (2004), 190 C.C.C. (3d) 496 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region

      <st1:place w:st="on">

    ) at para. 12:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It is not the law that the trial judge must expressly
    deal with every inconsistency in the evidence so long as the basis for the
    trial judge’s conclusions is apparent from the record.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal;
'>The above observation of Rosenberg J.A. has no application to a situation where
    the trial judge does not address any inconsistencies in the argument advanced
    by the defence.  </p>

    Supreme Court judgment in <i>R.E.M.</i> is distinguishable from the case
    at bar.  In <i>R.E.M.</i>, the Supreme Court concluded that the trial judge
    had expressly dealt with the contradictions in the complainant’s evidence.  At
    para. 59 of <i>R.E.M.</i>, the Chief Justice said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The trial judge found the complainant to be a credible
    witness and accepted most of her evidence, while rejecting some portions
    that had been contradicted by other evidence.  He discussed the reasons for
    these conclusions in some detail, noting that the complainant was a child
    at the time of most of the incidents, and that they had occurred a long time
    before.  Some of the errors in her evidence were understandable, he concluded.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>R.E.M.</i>,
    the Chief Justice referred to the reasons of Binnie J. in <i>R. v. Walker</i>,
    [2008] S.C.C. 34, 231 C.C.C. (3d) 289 at para. 20: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Reasons are sufficient if they are responsive to
    the case’s live issues and the parties’ legal arguments.  Their sufficiency
    should be measured not in the abstract, but as they respond to the substance
    of what was in issue.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal;
'>In my view, the trial judge failed to respond to the major live issue in this
    case.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    it is not necessary to embark on a detailed review of what evidence the trial
    judge accepts and rejects, she must, at least, demonstrate in her reasons
    that she “has seized the substance of the issue” on credibility.  See <i>R.E.M.</i> at
    para. 50.  The same can be said in respect of the issue of reliability in
    this case.  At least some mention of the contradictory evidence was called
    for.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, the reasons for judgment of the trial judge fail the test from <i>R.
    v. Sheppard</i>, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 869 and in <i>R.E.M.</i> in that they fail
    to address the central issue in the defence case.  This failure prevented
    meaningful appellate review of the trial judge’s decision.  The summary conviction
    appeal court judge, in turn, committed an error in law by failing to recognize
    that the inconsistency issue had not been addressed by the trial judge and
    thereby deprived the court of the opportunity of meaningful appellate review.</p>
