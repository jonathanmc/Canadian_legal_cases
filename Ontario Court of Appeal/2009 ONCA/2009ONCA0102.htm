    appellant, Harpreet Sandhu, and the complainant, Ms. Laveleet Sandhu, were
    married in 1996 in

    Ontario for six years, and had a daughter.  However, in 2002, the marriage
    broke down, and the parties separated.</p>

    separation, Ms. Sandhu went to the police and told them that her husband
    had physically and sexually abused her during their marriage, and had even
    threatened to kill her.  He was then charged on a three-count indictment,
    which alleged that he:</p>

    Sandhu pleaded not guilty, and was tried before Seppi J. and a jury.  The
    Crown’s theory was that Mr. Sandhu was not happy with his wife, that he wanted
    a younger and more beautiful woman, and that he had married the complainant
    solely to facilitate his and his parents’ immigration to
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  The defence’s theory was that Ms. Sandhu was angry when the appellant
    left the marriage and had retaliated by fabricating these allegations against
    him.</p>

    trial, Ms. Sandhu testified that on numerous occasions during the marriage,
    Mr. Sandhu physically assaulted her and forced himself on her when she did
    not want to have sex.  Mr. Sandhu testified, and denied the allegations.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    jury acquitted Mr. Sandhu on the threatening death count, but found him guilty
    on the other two counts: assault and sexual assault.  The trial judge sentenced
    Mr. Sandhu to a nine-month conditional sentence followed by one year of probation.</p>

      first incident of assault took place in late 1998, when Ms. Sandhu was
      five or six months pregnant.  Mr. Sandhu squeezed her throat by pressing
      both his thumbs on it.  When Ms. Sandhu went toward the telephone, possibly
      to call the police, Mr. Sandhu grabbed the phone.  Ms. Sandhu screamed
      and ran outside.  As she did, Mr. Sandhu kicked her, causing her hand to
      hit the wall.  Ms. Sandhu claimed that Mr. Sandhu prevented her from calling
      the police about this incident.</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
lang=EN-US style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span

      second incident occurred in February 2001.  Ms. Sandhu testified that both
      Mr. Sandhu and his mother assaulted her.  In her words, “his mother arrived
      and they got together to beat me up.”  According to Ms. Sandhu, they did
      so because she would not permit Mr. Sandhu to have a second marriage.  Ms.
      Sandhu elaborated on the beating, testifying that Mr. Sandhu twisted her
      arm, pulled her hair and slapped her onto the back of the neck.  </span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
lang=EN-US>After this assault Ms. Sandhu did call 911.  But Mr. Sandhu grabbed
      the phone from her, and then together with his mother demanded that Ms.
      Sandhu tell the police when they arrived that she had dialed 911 accidentally
      and that she did not need their assistance.  When the police did arrive,
      Ms. Sandhu did as she was told because she feared for her life if she did
      not comply.  She testified “I thought that the way he was threatening me,
      he could kill me or he could get me killed”.  She told the police that
      she had been trying to make a call to
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>
    – a plausible explanation as the country code for

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>
    .  Ms. Sandhu had an argument with her husband about what he did when he
    left the house.  She was doing some cooking at the time.  Mr. Sandhu told
    her not to ask him where he goes or what he does when he leaves.  She said
    that she had a right to know, whereupon Mr. Sandhu hit her in the neck with
    a hot spoon. </span></p>

      final assault occurred in early September 2002 just before the parties

      first incident occurred early in 1999 when Ms. Sandhu was eight to nine
      months pregnant.  Mr. Sandhu wanted to have sex with Ms. Sandhu but she
      turned him down.  She told him, “[y]ou are drunk and I don’t want to”,
      and “[m]y child is heavy.”  Mr. Sandhu then physically forced her to have
      intercourse with him.  He took off the pajama bottoms that she was wearing
      and had vaginal sex with her for five to ten minutes.</span></p>

      other incident took place in March 1999, about 10 to 15 days after their
      daughter had been born.  Because it was a cesarean birth, Ms. Sandhu had
      stitches and they had not healed.  She therefore told Mr. Sandhu not to
      have sex with her.  He persisted saying “I have to do it.  I’m going to
      do it.”  He then removed her pajamas and forcibly had sex with her.  </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>C.        ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>1)        Did the trial judge err by failing to instruct
      the jury about the improper use of evidence across counts?</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge instructed the jury to consider each of the counts separately.  She
      said:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span lang=EN-US>As there are three separate offences
      charged, you must consider each one individually to decide whether or not
      the Crown has proven the essential elements of each offence charged beyond
      a reasonable doubt.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However,
      Mr. Sandhu argues that this instruction did not go far enough.  He submits
      that because the three counts are found in one indictment and the Crown
      did not bring a similar fact application, the trial judge was obliged to
      warn the jury that they must consider only the evidence relevant to each
      assault in arriving at a verdict on that assault.  He relies on the judgment
      of this court in <i>R. v. M.(B.)</i> (1998), 42 O.R. (3d) 1, at p. 14,
      where Rosenberg J.A. discussed the need for this warning and the concern
      that, if it is not given, a jury may use evidence on one count to infer
      that the accused is the sort of bad person who would commit the offences
      charged on the other counts:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span lang=EN-US>Thus, in a case involving multiple
      counts and complainants, and where evidence is led of other uncharged misconduct,
      Sopinka J. identified two essential elements of a charge to the jury.  First,
      when evidence of one count is not admissible as similar fact evidence on
      the other counts, jurors must be instructed to consider each charge separately
      and not to use evidence relating to one count as evidence on any of the
      other counts.  In this case, the jury charge does not include this essential
      element.  The charge does not clearly explain to the jurors that they could
      not use the evidence of all the counts to prove any one count.</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span lang=EN-US>Second, <i>Rarru</i> requires
      the trial judge to give the jury a proper limiting instruction regardless
      of whether evidence of other counts or of uncharged misconduct is admissible
      as similar fact evidence.  The jury charge also fails to meet this standard.  Even
      if the evidence of the various counts had been admissible as similar fact
      evidence, a limiting instruction was required.  The jury had to be warned
      about misuse of the evidence of criminal and disreputable conduct.  I have
      already referred to this issue in relation to the bestiality counts.  It
      was essential that the jury be instructed that it was not to rely on the
      evidence of other counts or other uncharged misconduct as proof that the
      accused is the sort of person who would commit the offence or offences
      charged[.] [Citation omitted.]</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
      do not think that this instruction was required in this case.  Moreover,
      even if it had been given, it would not have benefited Mr. Sandhu.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First, <i>M.(B.)</i> is
      a case involving multiple offences against multiple victims and evidence
      of discreditable conduct outside the scope of the indictment.  I agree
      with the Crown that cases such as <i>M.(B.)</i> have limited application
      to a case such as the one before us where there is one victim and no material
      evidence outside the scope of the indictment.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second,
      much of the evidence given by both Mr. Sandhu and Ms. Sandhu is relevant
      to all the counts.  For example, in discussing her marital relationship,
      Ms. Sandhu testified that she sought her husband’s permission before doing
      anything, that she did as she was told, and that she would not have left
      him because her culture dictated otherwise.  All of this evidence was relevant
      to all the counts.  Equally, Mr. Sandhu’s testimony that his wife was the
      aggressor, that she was threatening and controlling, and that she fabricated
      the allegations to get back at him for leaving her, was relevant to all
      the counts.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span

      incidences over a lengthy period of time: see <i>R. v. Hulan</i>, [1969]

    ).  Indeed, as the Crown points out, commonly a single charge of assault
    or sexual assault is laid where the offender commits multiple or successive
    offences against the same person over time.  The rationale for doing so,
    in the words of Kelly J.A. in <i>Hulan</i>, is that “[t]he continued proximity
    of the appellant and the complainant and the following of an established

      Sandhu, however, submits that the several incidents of assault and sexual
      assault do not constitute a single transaction, and therefore the indictment
      is flawed.  He claims that the alleged acts against him did not demonstrate
      a pattern of conduct, and that unlike other cases, the complainant, his
      wife, was not a child.  These distinguishing features, he argues, mean
      that the indictment offends the single transaction rule.  </span></p>

      do not agree with Mr. Sandhu’s submission.  It seems to me that the acts
      Mr. Sandhu allegedly committed did amount to a pattern of conduct.  They
      were acts of domestic abuse against the same complainant, his wife, in
      their family home, during the last four years of their marriage.  </span></p>

      138 C.C.C. (3d) 383 (B.C.C.A.).  There, the accused was alleged to have
      committed four acts of indecent assault on his nephew over a four year
      period.  Like Mr. Sandhu, the accused was charged with a single count,
      which encompassed the four incidents.  Ryan J.A. held at para. 12 that
      the acts were
    “successive and cumulative” and, therefore, could be treated as a single
    transaction.</span></p>

      for multiple incidents to be included in a single count does not require
      the complainant to be a child.  In <i>R. v. Kaushal</i>, 1998 CanLII 2870
      (ON C.A.), leave to appeal to S.C.C. dismissed, [1998] S.C.C.A. No. 417,
      this court found that numerous incidents of spousal assault by a husband
      against his wife were properly treated as a single transaction “occurring
      as they did in the appellant’s home and representing a consistent pattern
      of conduct.”  The same may be said here.</span></p>

      would be concerned about the form of the indictment if I were persuaded
      that Mr. Sandhu was prejudiced by it.  However, we have no evidence that
      the indictment prejudiced him.  His wife’s statement to the police and
      her evidence at the preliminary inquiry told him the case he had to meet.  His
      defence to all her allegations was the same: she lied to get back at him

      Mr. Sandhu raised his complaint about the form of the indictment for the

      counts under s. 590 of the <i>Criminal</i> <i>Code</i> or apply for particulars
      under s. 587.  Although the failure to object to an indictment at trial
      does not preclude a successful objection on appeal – see <i>R. v. Selles</i> (1997),

      a single instance of unanimity in respect of any of the four charged factual
      incidents.”  In other words, Mr. Sandhu could be found guilty of assault
      if three jurors found him guilty on the first incident, three on the second
      incident, three on the third incident and three on the fourth incident
      of assault.  Such a risk, Mr. Sandhu contends, compromises the requirement
