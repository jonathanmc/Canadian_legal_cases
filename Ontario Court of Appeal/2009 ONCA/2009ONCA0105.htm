  <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    important issue raised on this appeal is whether, and if so, in what circumstances,
    a market-driven post-valuation date change in the value of a spouse’s assets
    may be taken into account in determining whether an equalization of family
    property is unconscionable under s. 5(6) of the <i>Family Law Act</i>.<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  This legal question has not previously been decided
    by this Court.  A second issue is whether
    – if the decline in value of the appellant’s principal asset may be taken
    into account – the equalization of family property would be unconscionable
    in the circumstances of this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Barbara
    and Harold Serra were married in 1976.  They separated 24 years later, in
    November 2000, and were divorced in 2003. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Serra carried on what had been a very profitable textile business in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Ajax,
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario, known as Ajax Textiles.  The success of that business enabled him
    and his wife to live in what the trial judge described as a “luxurious lifestyle”.  At
    the time of separation Mr. Serra’s shareholdings in the business – the principal
    asset in question – were valued at between $9.5 million and $11.25 million.  By
    the time of trial, however, the value had decreased to somewhere between
    $1.875 million and $2.6 million – a drop of approximately $8 to $9 million.  This
    dramatic change was not due to any fault on the part of Mr. Serra, who has
    done everything in his power to keep his failing business afloat.  The change
    is attributed entirely to shifting market forces that have adversely affected
    the Canadian textile industry generally.  It pre-dates the economic downturn
    that is currently bedevilling the Canadian and world economies and is therefore
    not the product of a temporary recession inevitably followed by an economic
    rebound.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, Mr. Serra argued that equalizing his and his wife’s net family properties
    on the basis of the separation-date value of his assets would be “unconscionable” as
    contemplated by s. 5(6) of the FLA.  It would require him to make an equalization
    payment of $4,129,832.50 – an amount that exceeds his total net worth (and
    on one view of the evidence, could be as much as twice his total net worth).  The
    trial judge ruled, however, that she could not take a market-driven post-separation
    date decline in the value of a spouse’s assets into account under s. 5(6)
    and ordered the large equalization payment.  In my respectful view, she erred
    in taking this approach, and I would allow the appeal on this ground for
    the reasons that follow.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Serra raises other issues on the appeal as well.  Chief amongst these is
    the matter of the respondent’s claim for a constructive or resulting trust
    in the shares Mr. Serra holds in the business.  This claim was asserted by
    Ms. Serra from the outset and was maintained until the eve of trial.  It
    helped to underpin an interim preservation order she obtained, precluding
    the appellant from dealing with any of his assets without her permission
    prior to trial.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Serra initially denied the trust claim, but ultimately delivered a formal
    admission accepting that he held 1000 common shares in the business in trust
    for the respondent.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a>  Having read the tea leaves herself, Ms. Serra
    subsequently sought leave to withdraw her trust claim at the beginning of
    the trial.  Justice Herman declined to permit her to do so.  However, she
    also declined to act upon the appellant’s admission.  She decided to try
    the issue and found on the evidence that there was no constructive trust.  The
    appellant argues that the trial judge erred in doing so because, he submits,
    the admission was dispositive of the trust question.  He therefore contends
    that the appeal should be allowed on this additional basis.  Although there
    is much to be said in favour of this argument, I would not give effect to
    it in the end, for reasons that I will explain.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Three
    other grounds of appeal were advanced.  The appellant submits that the trial
    judge erred in:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>failing
    to provide him with more than four years to make the equalization payment;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>assessing
    spousal support on the basis of an imputed annual income of $250,000; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>awarding
    the respondent post-judgment interest on the amount of the equalization payment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would not give effect to these three grounds of appeal either, as they are
    essentially matters involving the exercise of the trial judge’s discretionary
    and fact-finding functions.  I see no error justifying interference with
    her determination of those questions.</p>
  <h3>FACTS</h3>
  <p><b>The Family</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Serra was quite young – 17 years of age – when she first came to work for
    Ajax Textiles, in 1967.  At the time Mr. Serra was still married to his second
    wife.  Ms. Serra married another man and left the workforce when her son,
    Grant, was born in 1969.  When her marriage broke up she went back to work
    as a single mother, ultimately returning to Ajax Textiles.  She and Mr. Serra
    began to live together sometime in 1974 and were married in 1976 after Mr.
    Serra divorced his second wife.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Serra adopted Grant.  He has a son, Terry, from a previous marriage.  The
    Serra’s own child, Shane, was born in 1973.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Serra continued to work in the business for some time.  She operated her
    own dress shop from 1977 until 1983.  In 1983, the family moved to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Orillia and she stopped working outside the home in order to focus on the
    children.  The family lived in a very nice home in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Orillia.  In the late 1990’s they acquired a condominium property in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Florida.  As the trial judge found:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Mr. Serra and Ms. Serra had a luxurious lifestyle:
    they drove expensive cars, went on expensive vacations and ate in expensive
    restaurants; Ms. Serra had a limousine driver; there was household help;
    they had a condominium in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Florida where Ms. Serra spent six months each year.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    and Ms. Serra separated in November 2000 and were divorced in 2003.  At the
    time of the trial of the property and support issues before Justice Herman,
    Mr. Serra was 62 years of age and Ms. Serra was 56.  He has since remarried
    again and has a new child, a daughter who was three years old at the time
    of trial.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Serra continues to operate the textile business.  Ms. Serra has not remarried
    and has not returned to the workforce.  The
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Florida condominium has not yet been sold and she continues to spend about
    six months of the year there.</p>
  <h3>The Textile Business and Mr. Serra’s Financial Affairs</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the trial judge found, “Mr. Serra’s personal financial situation is intertwined
    with that of his business.”  His affairs are complex, but need not be outlined
    in detail here.  They are reviewed at length in the trial judgment.<a href="#_ftn3"
name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[3]</span></span></span></a>  The following factors are pertinent, however.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Serra is the legal owner of an indirect 75% interest in Ajax Textiles Processing
    Company Limited (the textile business) and DR Serra Enterprises Limited (the
    company that owns the land on which the business is located).<a href="#_ftn4"
name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[4]</span></span></span></a>  This interest is held in the form of 3,000 common
    shares in a holding company, 821129 Ontario Inc.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[5]</span></span></span></a>  The remaining 25% is held by a family trust for
    the benefit of the parties’ children.  One thousand of Mr. Serra’s 3,000
    common shares were – as the trial judge found – a gift from his now-deceased
    brother received during the marriage, and were therefore exempt from his
    net family property.  Mr. Serra takes the position that he holds 1,000 of
    the remaining 2,000 common shares in trust for the respondent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ajax
    Textiles operates as a commission dye and finishing house for knitted fabrics.  Once
    a highly successful venture, it has fallen on hard times, however.  The trial
    judge found:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[30] The textile division was, at one time, very
    successful.  By 2004, there had been a significant decline in its business.  This
    decline was primarily due to two factors: the phased-in removal of tariffs
    and quotas in the textile industry between 1995 and 2005; and the impact
    of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">China</st1:country-region>
    ’s entry into the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001.  The company’s
    customer base changed from a few customers with large orders to smaller orders,
    just-in-time business and orders where the products have to be made in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  Increased costs and pricing pressure from customers have led to a further
    decline in profits.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[31] According to valuations conducted by KPMG,
    the value of the textile division declined by $8-9 million between November
    2000 (the date of separation) and November 2004.  A chart of earnings of
    the textile division shows that in the years between 2000 and 2005, the company
    lost money in every year but 2002.  As of August 31, 2006,
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Ajax showed a net operating loss of $1,200,000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Canadian
    policy regarding the textile industry began to change in the mid-1990’s,
    when the members of the WTO, including Canada, agreed to eliminate the system
    of quotas and import restrictions over a period of years.  The admission
    of
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">China</st1:country-region>
    into the WTO in 2001 magnified the damage to the Canadian industry, however,
    and the situation was exacerbated by the Caribbean Basin Trade Initiative
    signed by the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">U.S.</st1:country-region>
    in 2000.  In 2002,
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    cut duties and restrictions on imports from 48 of the world’s poorest countries.  All
    of these developments undermined the domestic textile business because producers
    found it cheaper to conduct business offshore.  The foregoing information,
    extracted from the KPMG Report tendered on behalf of Mr. Serra, is not contested.  It
    suggests that the wide-ranging and lasting impact of the tariff and WTO changes
    did not hit the textile industry until the period following the Serra’s separation
    and at a point coinciding more or less with the commencement of Ms. Serra’s
    action. </p>

        Serra’s expert did not seriously contest KPMG’s valuation of his interest
        in the business.</span></span>  Significantly as well, Ms. Serra conceded
        that the decline in the value of the business could not be attributed
        to any fault or lack of effort on the part of Mr. Serra.  In this regard,
        the trial judge also found:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There is no suggestion that the decline in the
    value of the business is other than market-driven.  While Ms. Serra questions
    the extent of the decline, she acknowledges that the decline, to the extent

    Serra has – or had – other assets as well; however, their significance pales
    in comparison to his interest in Ajax Textiles at its zenith.  The companies
    owed him substantial amounts on his director’s loan account, but these funds,
    although accounted for in the net family property calculation, have been
    largely depleted in an effort to keep the business afloat and as the ultimate
    source of interim support and other payments made to or on behalf of Ms.
    Serra prior to trial.  Mr. Serra had a 50% interest in the matrimonial home
    in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Orillia and has a similar interest in the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Florida condominium.  A contentious issue at trial concerned the amount of
    cash he held in a Bahamian bank, the Barrington Bank, and the value of a
    2% shareholding interest in that Bank.  The trial judge valued the interest
    at U.S. $200,000 ($308,000 Cdn.).  There is no appeal from that finding.</p>

    Serra fought long and hard – and expensively – to establish that Mr. Serra
    was hiding assets and refusing to disclose his true financial position.  This
    may have been because of what the trial judge acknowledged as the “complex
    web” of Mr. Serra’s “interrelated financial interests.”  However, the trial
    judge ruled against Ms. Serra on those issues, holding that “there [was]
    no direct evidence at the trial of funds or income that Mr. Serra is currently
    failing to disclose.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Barrington Bank situation was a central point of contention.  However, as
    the trial judge determined, Mr. Serra’s involvement with the Bank arose out
    of his search for funds for the business in 2000 after the CIBC had advised
    him to find alternative financing.  An acquaintance and former customer was
    establishing a bank in the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Bahamas</st1:country-region>
    and needed a third investor for that purpose.  Mr. Serra transferred monies
    from a foreign account to a deposit account in the Bank and took a 2% shareholding
    position (with 25% of the voting rights) in the Bank.  The monies in the
    account, together with a mortgage on the property where Ajax Textile carried
    on business, served as security for a $2.3 million loan advanced by Barrington
    Bank to the business.</p>

    judge found:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[82] Ms. Serra was sometimes paid a salary; sometimes
    she was not.  It would appear that the payment of a salary was more of an
    income-splitting device than compensation for work that Ms. Serra performed.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[83] However, Ms. Serra was compensated in ways
    other than salary.  What she received in return was a very comfortable lifestyle.  She
    had full-time staff to help her run the household and look after the children.  She
    had cars: a Mercedes, a limousine and a limousine driver.  She had two homes:

    the impetus for Mr. Serra’s efforts to keep the business alive, and his ability
    to take measures designed to have that effect, were shaped by the evolution
    of the litigation between the parties.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    action was commenced in December 2002.  Among other things, Ms. Serra claimed
    periodic support, a trust interest in her husband’s shares in the business,
    an interim and permanent restraining order prohibiting him from disposing
    of or otherwise dealing with <u>any</u> of his property and assets, and a
    preservation order with respect to <u>all</u> of his property and assets.</p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>The Interim Support Order</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    December 19, 2002, Sachs J. dealt with an urgent interim motion, made prior
    to a case conference, seeking interim support and interim restraining and
    preservation orders.  The latter claims were adjourned, to be dealt with
    finally in August, 2004.  However, Sachs J. made an interim order at that
    time requiring Mr. Serra to:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>a)<span

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>c)<span

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

    of the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Florida property nor the $7,500 payments were deductible in the hands of
    the appellant.  At trial, the payments were determined to be capital and
    credited to Mr. Serra against his equalization payment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Prior
    to the proceedings, the respondent had received a salary and other benefits
    from Ajax Textiles.  In 2001 and 2002 she received a total of $372,230.93.  To
    that point in time, Ajax Textile’s historical tax-driven practice had been
    to bonus its profits out to Mr. Serra, who would immediately lend most of
    the monies back to the company for operational purposes.  Justice Sachs’
    interim order was therefore based on a high level of “income” for Mr. Serra – $2
    million in 1999, for example.  Following the order of Sachs J., Mr. Serra
    began to receive a salary of $250,000 from the company in order to permit
    him the advantage of deducting the $12,500 monthly support payment.  By the
    time of trial, in 2006, he had paid Ms. Serra $1.75 million in support and
    capital payments.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    payments could only be made if Ajax Textiles remained in business.  Mr. Serra
    made every effort he could to facilitate this.  He testified that in order
    to keep Ajax Textiles running, he depleted his $2 million loan account with
    Ajax Textiles, borrowed more than $1 million, laid off employees, rolled
    back salaries, reduced shifts, closed the Marine Division, sold corporate
    assets, increased corporate debt, obtained alternate financing after the
    Chartered Banks declined to lend further funds, mortgaged his own home, cashed
    in his and his new wife’s RRSPs and his life insurance polices, and injected
    all of the proceeds into Ajax to keep it operational.  He is financially
    strapped and left without any further assets to encumber or sell.</p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>The Trust Claims</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From
    the outset, Ms. Serra claimed a resulting, constructive or implied trust
    in all of Mr. Serra’s assets.  The inventory was long – twenty-seven items
    were listed in the statement of claim, as well as a claim to any other assets
    he may have.  But the principal target was her claim to a 50% interest in
    all 3,000 of his shares in 821129 Ontario Inc., the company through which
    he holds his interest in Ajax Textiles.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    August and September, 2004, the interim restraining and preservation orders
    that were originally before Justice Sachs in December, 2002, were dealt with.  On
    August 26, at the instance of the respondent, the court ordered that Mr.
    Serra take no steps to sell the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Florida property.  On September 16, again at the request of the respondent,
    Justice Karakatsanis granted a preservation order, requiring the appellant
    (a) to preserve all property in which he had an interest, directly or indirectly,
    and over which he could exercise any control, directly or indirectly, and
    (b) to provide Ms. Serra with at least 30 days notice of any intended disposition.  Needless
    to say, this order had an impact on Mr. Serra’s ability to dispose of, preserve,
    maintain or improve the textile business and hence on the value of his indirect
    shareholding position in it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Serra testified that his shares had no current value at the time of trial
    on a liquidation basis and that there were no prospective buyers for the
    textile business.  In fact, all but two of the approximately ten dye houses
    that formerly operated in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario have gone out of business.  This evidence was undisputed.</p>

    Morton suggested that Mr. Serra could have applied for a variation of the
    interim support order and the preservation and restraining orders if they
    were difficult to comply with or otherwise oppressive to him.  That is not
    the point, however.  Mr. Serra does not argue that he was unable to make
    the payments required or to live with the preservation and restraining orders.  He
    maintains simply that it was necessary for him to keep Ajax Textiles operating
    – and in Ms. Serra’s interests that he do so – in order to be able to meet
    his obligations, and that the preservation and restraining orders affected
    his ability to do so.</p>

  <h3>ANALYSIS </h3>
  <p><b>The Section 5(6) Issue</b></p>
  <p><u>Recognizing Post-Separation Changes in Value</u></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Serra relies upon s. 5(6) of the <i>Family Law Act</i> in support of his
    claim that equalizing the net family properties of the parties as at the
    date of separation would be unconscionable.  Section 5(6) states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The court may award a spouse an amount that is
    more or less than half the difference between the net family properties if
    the court is of the opinion that equalizing the net family properties would
    be unconscionable, having regard to,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a)  a spouse’s failure to disclose to the other
    spouse debts or other liabilities existing at the date of the marriage;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b)  the fact that debts or other liabilities claimed
    in reduction of a spouse’s net family property were incurred recklessly or
    in bad faith;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(c)  the part of a spouse’s net family property
    that consists of gifts made by the other spouse;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(d)  a spouse’s intentional or reckless depletion
    of his or her net family property;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(e)  the fact that the amount a spouse would otherwise
    receive under subsection (1), (2), or (3) is disproportionately large in
    relation to a period of cohabitation that is less than five years;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(f)  the fact that one spouse has incurred a disproportionately
    larger amount of debts or other liabilities than the other spouse for the
    support of the family;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(g)  a written agreement between the spouses that
    is not a domestic contract; or </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(h)  any other circumstance relating to the acquisition,
    disposition, preservation, maintenance or improvement of property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    steps to be taken when s. 5(6) is engaged are well-established.  The court
    must first ascertain the net family property of each spouse, by determining
    and valuing the property each owned on the valuation date (subject to the
    deductions and exemptions set out in s. 4).  Next, the court applies s. 5(1)
    and determines the equalization payment.  Finally – and before making an
    order under s. 5(1) – the court must decide whether the equalization of net
    family properties would be unconscionable under s. 5(6), having regard to
    the factors listed in paragraphs 5(6)(a) through (h). See <i>Rawluk v. Rawluk </i>[1990]
    1 S.C.R. 70 at pp. 93-94; <i>Berdette v. Berdette</i> (1991), 3 O.R. (3d)

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,
    steps one and two are not in issue, but the application of s. 5(6) is.  The
    appellant relies in particular upon paragraph 5(6)(h) above.  He says that
    the marked post-separation date decline in value of the textile business
    and therefore of his common shares in it, in combination with the respondent’s
    trust claims to an interest in those shares, the preservation order she obtained,
    and the significant interim support and capital payments he was required
    to make (and which could only be made out of an operating Ajax Textiles),
    are all circumstances relating to the disposition, preservation and maintenance
    of Ajax Textiles and, therefore, of his property assets.  In these circumstances,
    it would be “unconscionable” to order an equalization of net family properties
    based upon a separation-date valuation of his interest in the business; to
    do so would be to require him to make an equalization payment that exceeds
    his total net worth, perhaps significantly.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    scope of the exception in s. 5(6) – and, in particular, whether its factors
    encompass post-valuation date fluctuations in the value of family property
    assets – has been the subject of considerable controversy amongst family
    law professionals.  This is perhaps because the exception appears to fly
    in the face of what is seen as the essential characteristic of present-day
    family law legislation in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario, namely, the promotion of certainty, predictability and finality
    in the determination of support obligations and property division and the
    removal of judicial discretion in those areas to the extent possible.  The
    great concern – as Mr. Epstein fairly acknowledged during oral argument – is
    to dispel any interpretation of the <i>Family Law Act</i> that might suggest
    the courts are empowered to deal with the division of family property on
    the basis of “discretionary fairness.”  On this view, expanding the discretion
    in the hands of the judiciary in family law matters is anathema to

    my opinion, however, the concern is overblown, especially on the facts of
    this case, and misses the distinction between <i>factors that may legitimately
    be</i> <i>considered</i> under s. 5(6) and <i>a finding of unconscionability</i> under
    that provision.</p>

    arising from misconduct on the part of the spouse who owns the asset in question
    or against whose favour the unequal distribution is to be made.  Indeed,
    the general view to this point appears to be that post-valuation date variations

    fully rejected the possibility of considering post-separation circumstances
    under s. 5(6).”  He went on to posit that “there does seem to be room within
    s. 5(6) to consider post-separation circumstances in limited situations,
    such as where the conduct of one spouse post-separation has resulted in a
    significant depletion of assets.”  The court in <i>LeVan</i> decided that
    it was not necessary to resolve the issue because s. 5(6) was not engaged
    in the circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial in <i>LeVan</i>, Justice Backhouse had concluded that the factors in
    s. 5(6) did not include post-separation changes in value, expressing the
    opinion (at para. 267) that if
    “the Legislature [had] intended that post valuation date increases and decreases
    in value might form the basis of a s. 5(6) application, I think it likely,
    given the frequency of these events, that it would have included a provision
    to this effect.”  Here, the trial judge came to a similar conclusion.  At
    paras. 135-136 she held:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Turning to the language of s. 5(6)(h) itself, a
    market-driven decline in value does not appear to come within the “acquisition,
    disposition, preservation, maintenance or improvement”
    of a property.  This is to be contrasted to a situation in which the conduct
    of a spouse had an impact on the value of the property.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I conclude that the circumstances in which a court
    may order an unequal division of net family property under s. 5(6) do not
    include a market-driven decline in the value of the property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Respectfully,

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my opinion, a court may take into account a post-separation date change in
    the value of a spouse’s assets, and the circumstances surrounding such a
    change, for purposes of determining under s. 5(6) of the <i>Family Law Act</i> whether
    equalizing net family properties would be unconscionable.  An order for an
    unequal division of net family properties is exceptional, however, and may
    only be made on such a basis (i) where the circumstances giving rise to the
    change in value relate (directly or indirectly) to the acquisition, disposition,
    preservation, maintenance or improvement of property (s.&nbsp;5(6)(h)), and
    (ii) where equalizing the net family property would be unconscionable, having
    regard to those circumstances (taken alone or in conjunction with other factors
    mentioned in s. 5(6)). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this regard, the threshold of “unconscionability”
    under s. 5(6) is exceptionally high.  The jurisprudence is clear that circumstances
    which are “unfair”, “harsh” or
    “unjust” alone do not meet the test.  To cross the threshold, an equal division
    of net family properties in the circumstances must “shock the conscience
    of the court”: see <i>Merklinger v. Merklinger</i> (1992), 11 O.R. (3d) 233
    (Ont. Gen. Div.), aff’d (1996), 30 O.R. (3d) 575 (C.A.); <i>Roseneck v. Gowling </i>(2002),

    and of Jennings J. in <i>Merklinger</i>:<i> </i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>LeVan</i>, at para. 258:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>“Unconscionability” is a much more difficult test
    to meet than “fairness” and as a result, the courts have only minimal discretion
    to order anything other than an equal division of family property. Unconscionable
    conduct has been defined as, among other things, conduct that is harsh and
    shocking to the conscience, repugnant to anyone's sense of justice, or shocking
    to the conscience of the court. [Citations omitted].</p>

        chose to strictly define the severity of the result of the application
        of s. 5(1) which must pertain before there can be any judicial intervention. <i>The
        result must be more than hardship, more than unfair, more than inequitable.

    it does not follow that because the threshold is exceptionally high the factors
    to be taken into account in assessing whether that threshold has been crossed
    should not include post-separation changes in the value of a spouse’s assets
    and the circumstances surrounding that change.  In an article published after
    the trial decision in <i>LeVan</i>, but before the argument on appeal, Professor
    Bala stated:<a

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is submitted that while the outcome in <i>LeVan</i> may
    well be correct, the courts should interpret the vague, general words of
    s. 5(6)(h) to include the factor of a post-separation decline in property
    values that renders an equalizing of net family properties as evaluated on
    separation date to be unconscionable.  It seems inappropriate for there to
    be judicial recognition only of post separation increases in property values,
    with post-separation declines ignored, even in situations of
    “unconscionability.”  While in some circumstances it is appropriate to expect
    the titled spouse to dispose of the assets after separation or bear the full
    risk of not doing so, there are circumstances when such a disposition would
    be unreasonable.</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Today there is only one principle or approach,
    namely, the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context, in their
    grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the
    object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>This principle has been
    adopted as the standard by the Supreme Court of Canada on numerous occasions.  See,

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    rationale behind the statutory direction in s. 5 of the <i>Family Law Act</i> that
    net family property is to be shared equally – with the rare exception provided
    in s. 5(6)
    – is set out in s. 5(7) of the <i>Act</i>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The purpose of this section is to recognize that
    child care, household management and financial provision are the joint responsibilities
    of the spouses and that inherent in the marital relationship there is equal
    contribution, whether financial or otherwise, by the spouses to the assumption
    of these responsibilities, entitling each spouse to the equalization of the
    net family properties, <i>subject only to the equitable considerations set
    out in subsection (6)</i>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    rationale is affirmed in the preamble of the <i>Act</i>, which states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Whereas it is desirable to encourage and strengthen
    the role of the family; and whereas for that purpose it is necessary to recognize
    the equal position of spouses as individuals within marriage and to recognize
    marriage as a form of partnership; <i>and whereas in support of such recognition
    it is necessary to provide in law for the orderly and equitable settlement
    of the affairs of the spouses upon the breakdown of the partnership,</i> and
    to provide for other mutual obligations in family relationships, including
    the equitable sharing by parents of responsibility for their children; [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is a jurisprudential theme running through the cases to the effect that relief
    may only be granted under s. 5(6) where there has been fault-based conduct
    on the part of the asset-owning spouse, that is, that the word “unconscionable” embraces
    factors relating to “unconscionable conduct” only: see, for example, <i>von
    Czieslik v. Ayuso</i> (2007), 86 O.R. (3d) 88 (C.A.); <i>LeVan</i>; and <i>Merklinger</i>.  In <i>von
    Czieslik</i>, for instance, Lang J.A. noted in <i>obiter</i>, “the legislative
    restriction of s. 5(6)’s application to certain enumerated circumstances,
    none of which have to do with ownership, <i>but all of which relate to fault-based
    conduct on the part of the other spouse</i>” (at para. 29).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Respectfully,
    I do not think this proposition is correct.  First, it is clear that <i>not
    all</i> of the enumerated circumstances in s. 5(6) relate to fault-based
    conduct on the part of a spouse.  Three of them – 5(6)(a), (b) and (d) – do.  Four
    of them – 5(6)(c), (e), (f) and (g) – do not.  One – 5(6)(h), the general
    basket clause at issue here – may or may not arise in conduct-related circumstances.  Accordingly,
    there is no basis for concluding that the general basket clause in the list
    must take its colour and meaning from a previous list of specific conduct-based
    factors and, therefore, that the
    “circumstances” referred to must themselves embody fault-based conduct.  That
    is not the case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Secondly,
    neither the purpose or object of the s. 5 equalization payment scheme, the
    s. 5(6) exception, nor of the <i>Act</i> itself call for such an interpretation.
    The design of the legislation is to promote the goals of certainty, predictability
    and finality in the resolution of property matters following the breakdown
    of marriage.  This, in turn, is founded on the central premise articulated
    in s. 5(7) that “inherent in the marital relationship there is equal contribution,
    whether financial or otherwise, by the spouses to the assumption of [their
    joint] responsibilities, entitling each spouse to the equalization of the
    net family properties, <i>subject only to the equitable considerations set
    out in subsection (6)</i>.” (emphasis added)  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    to ensure adherence to the policy choices made by the Legislature, and reflected
    in s. 5(7) and the preamble of the <i>Act</i>, equalization of net family
    properties is the general rule.  As with most rules, however, there are exceptions – in
    this case, the high-threshold unconscionability provisions of s. 5(6).  This
    exception is expressly contemplated by the caveat “subject only to the equitable
    considerations set out in subsection (6)” set out in s. 5(7).  Judicial discretion
    with respect to equalization payments is therefore severely restricted, by
    statutory design, but it is not eliminated altogether since there is discretion
    to order an unequal payment where “the court is of the opinion that equalizing
    the net family properties would be unconscionable”: see, for example, <i>Skrlj
    v. Skrlj</i> (1986), 2 R.F.L. (3d) 305 at p. 309 (
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Ont. S.C.).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is no principled reason that I can see, given the language of the <i>Act</i> and
    its purpose or objects, to confine the word “unconscionable” in s. 5(6) only
    to circumstances arising from fault-based conduct on the part of one of the
    spouses.  Although unconscionable <i>conduct </i>is obviously an appropriate
    consideration in determining whether equalizing the net family properties
    would be unconscionable, in my opinion the true target of the limited exception
    to the general rule is a situation that leads to an unconscionable <i>result</i>,
    whether that result flows from fault-based conduct or not.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not read this Court’s decision in <i>von Czieslik </i>as requiring anything
    to the contrary.  That case evolved out of pre-separation misconduct on the
    part of the husband.  He had “gifted” a large portion of his assets to a
    friend just prior to the separation, thus reducing his net family property
    and frustrating his former wife’s right to share in what had been accumulated
    during the marriage.  It was in this context that Lang J.A., understandably,
    focussed on the “fault-based conduct” of the husband.  However, the s.&nbsp;5(6)
    issue in the case was whether, in making a s. 5(6) award, courts are restricted
    to the difference between the parties’ net family properties (the court held
    it was not).  The issue was not, as here, whether post-separation circumstances
    that do not involve misconduct on the part of the asset-owning spouse may
    be taken into account.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    marked downturn in the textile industry is a
    “circumstance relating to” (at least) the “disposition, preservation [and]
    maintenance” of Ajax Textiles - the shares of which are Mr. Serra’s major
    asset - within the meaning of s. 5(6)(h).  So, too, are several other factors
    characterizing this case: the preservation order obtained by Ms. Serra, her
    ongoing claim for a trust interest in the assets, and the significant interim
    payments Mr. Serra was ordered to make and which could only be made if he
    kept Ajax Textiles operating as a viable business.  Eight of the existing
    ten comparable businesses in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario had gone out of business.  There were no buyers for Ajax Textiles,
    and Mr. Serra testified that the company’s liquidation value was zero by
    the time of trial.  This is not a case, then – like <i>LeVan</i>, for instance – where
    the owner of the diminishing asset could have sold it in a falling market
    in order to preserve at least some of its value.  Nor, I emphasize, is it
    a case of a temporary decrease in the value of an asset resulting from a
    temporary economic recession; the difficulties in the domestic textile industry
    were well embedded before the onset of the current economic downturn.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sale of Ajax Textiles was not a workable solution in the circumstances of
    this case for other reasons as well.  Ms. Serra claimed an interest in the
    company.  She consistently refused to agree to the disposition of the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Florida condominium which was costing Mr. Serra $5,000 each month pursuant
    to the order of Sachs J.  In addition he was required to pay Ms. Serra monthly
    support of $12,500 and an additional $7,500 per month (support or capital – to
    be determined later) by the same order.  His only source of income to comply
    with those obligations was what he could derive from the continued operation
    of the business.  He therefore engaged in the assiduous attempts outlined
    above (para. 29) to preserve and maintain the business, depleting whatever
    other assets he may have had in the process.  Even in these efforts he was
    affected by the preservation order that had been obtained because he required
    the prior permission of Ms. Serra for any actions he planned to take in relation
    to those assets.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my respectful view, therefore, the trial judge erred in refusing to take
    into account the market-driven downward impact on the value of Mr. Serra’s
    interest in Ajax Textile, in combination with the other factors mentioned
    above, in considering the application of s. 5(6) of the <i>Family Law Act</i>.  These
    are all factors to be considered in the s. 5(6) analysis. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Do
    these factors mean that this is one of the cases where an equalization of
    net family property would be “unconscionable” in the circumstances, however?  I
    turn to that question now.</p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>Unconscionability</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is worth emphasizing that the <i>legal</i> <i>issue</i> in question here
    is whether a market-driven decline in value of a spouse’s assets post-separation <i>may
    be considered as a factor</i> in determining whether an equalization of net
    family property is unconscionable under s. 5(6).  Concluding that it may
    be considered as a factor does not lead necessarily to a <i>finding</i> <i>on
    the facts</i> that an equalization order would be <i>unconscionable</i>.  This
    is an important distinction, in my view, and may sometimes be overlooked
    in the heat of the debate over finality and certainty versus discretionary
    fairness.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    a purely market-driven decline in the value of Mr. Serra’s principal asset
    is at the heart of these proceedings, this case is not about whether a significant
    post-separation drop in the value of an individual’s stock portfolio, precipitated
    by a deep but temporary recession, will amount to unconscionability.  Such
    an occurrence may well be a factor for consideration under s. 5(6)(h), but
    whether it would be sufficient by itself to constitute “unconscionability” is
    quite another matter.  Each case must be determined on its own facts.  In
    the circumstances here, however, I am satisfied that an equalization of net
    family property would be unconscionable, given the dramatic downward turn
    in Mr. Serra’s fortunes and the factors giving rise to, and surrounding,
    it.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is not a situation where any of the other factors listed in clauses (a) through
    (g) of s. 5(6) come into play to be weighed in the analysis against the market-driven
    decrease in value.  For example, there is no fault-based conduct on the part
    of Mr. Serra that could – if it existed – be evaluated in the s. 5(6) analysis
    against the market-driven factors affecting his assets, as there was in such
    cases as <i>LeVan</i>, <i>von Czieslik</i> and others.<a href="#_ftn14" name="_ftnref14" title=""><span

'>[14]</span></span></span></span></a>  As the trial judge noted, “[t]here is
    no suggestion that the decline in the value of the business is other than
    market-driven.”  Nor – for reasons mentioned above – is this a situation
    like <i>LeVan </i>where Mr. Serra could have disposed of the business (or
    of his shares in it) as a hedge against their downward trend in value, another
    factor that could otherwise be considered in the mix.  It was necessary to
    keep Ajax Textiles afloat to enable him to continue to meet the interim support
    and capital obligations he had been ordered to pay. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    these circumstances, an equalization of net family property that requires
    Mr. Serra to pay <i>more than his total net worth</i> (and arguably as much
    as twice his net worth) because of a marked decline in the value of his major
    asset post-separation –
    over which he had absolutely no control and in spite of his best efforts
    to save the business in the face of Ms. Serra’s trust claims, the preservation
    order and the need to comply with his support obligations – is, in my view,
    unconscionable.  In so concluding, I have taken into account that Ms. Serra
    is not a woman without means.  The trial judge found she left the marriage
    “with assets worth a considerable amount.”  She has net family property of
    about $1 million in addition to her interest in the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Florida property.  She has lived, and continues to live, a life of relative

    and 6 months in
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    on the exercise of judicial discretion. The court seeks to do fairness as
    between the parties. The challenges of this approach are commented on by
    Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead in a recent decision in the House of Lords, <i>Miller
    v. Miller</i>; <i>McFarlane v. McFarlane</i>, [2006] U.K.H.L. 24, [2006]
    1 FLR 1186. At p. 6, para. 4, he states:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>Fairness is an elusive concept. It is an instinctive
    response to a given set of facts. Ultimately it is grounded in social and
    moral values. These values, or attitudes, can be stated. But they cannot
    be justified, or refuted, by any objective process of logical reasoning.
    Moreover, they change from one generation to the next. It is not surprising
    therefore that in the present context there can be different views on the
    requirements of fairness in any particular case.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I think that it is unfair to refer to this approach
    as “palm tree justice”. (Heon v. Heon <span style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New Roman";'><span style='
color:windowtext'>(1989), 69 O.R. (2d) 758</span>, <span style='
color:windowtext'>[1989] O.J. No. 1457</span>, <span style='
color:windowtext'>22 R.F.L. (3d) 273</span> </span>(H.C.J.)). Nevertheless,
    it is clear that the Legislature rejected this approach. Conferring a general
    discretion based on a judge's evaluation of the marriage and who contributed
    what is exactly what the <i>Act</i> does not contemplate. In my respectful
    opinion, Mr. Epstein's submission is more consistent with the Act. Instead
    of imposing one’s own assessment of fairness, the court determines when unconscionability
    ends. In this way, the basic principle of equal division is only departed
    from to the extent necessary to avoid unconscionability. Many equal divisions
    may be unfair. But, unless unconscionable, these are operative.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    concede that this approach – clearly and well articulated as it has been
    by Backhouse J. – has a certain attraction.  Respectfully, however, I do
    not agree with it.  I say this for two reasons.  First, I do not accept that
    it represents an interpretation of s. 5(6) that is more consistent with the <i>Act</i>.  Secondly,
    an order that is just shy of unconscionable remains – by jurisprudential
    definition – an order that is at least unfair, unjust and inequitable, if
    not worse.  Courts do not make orders deliberately, in the exercise of their
    discretion, that are unfair, unjust and inequitable; it is the antithesis
    of what courts stand for.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    5(6) does not call for an award that is just short of unconscionable.  It
    provides that the court may award a spouse “an amount that is more or less
    than half the difference between the net family properties” <i>if</i> “<i>equalizing</i> the
    net family properties <i>would be unconscionable</i>”. (emphasis added)  In
    short, the threshold that an applicant must cross in order to open the door
    to an unequal division is – as I have said earlier in these reasons – exceptionally
    high.  That is because of the policy underlying the <i>Act</i> encouraging
    finality, predictability and certainty and minimizing the exercise of judicial
    discretion to the extent possible, also referred to earlier.  Once the threshold
    has been crossed, however, and the rare resort to judicial discretion under
    the <i>Act</i> is in play, the court should exercise its discretion as it
    normally does: by doing what is just, fair and equitable in the circumstances.  Such
    an approach, in my opinion, is (a) true to the language of s. 5(6) itself,
    (b) reflective of the wording in s. 5(7) establishing that the presumed equal
    contribution of the spouses leading to the normal equal division of net family
    property is subject only to the “equitable” considerations set out in s.
    5(6); and (c) consistent with the call in the preamble of the <i>Act</i> for “the
    orderly <i>and equitable</i> settlement of the affairs of the spouses upon
    the breakdown of the partnership.”</p>

    of $1.5 million which, after credit for the capital payments he has already
    made, nets out to a payment due now of $656,000.  This is arrived at by taking
    Mr. Serra’s net family property at the date of trial as $4.5 million (after
    taking into account the decreased value of the textile business, based on
    the KPMG valuation as of November, 2004) and valuing Ms. Serra’s at $1.5
    million.<a href="#_ftn15" name="_ftnref15" title=""><span

    is $3 million, one-half of which is $1.5 million.  From that amount must
    be deducted credit for capital payments already made by Mr. Serra.  The balance
    is $656,000 – a far cry from the net of almost $3.3 million ordered by the
    trial judge.<a href="#_ftn16"

    respondent does not seriously quarrel with the numbers themselves but argues,
    of course, that there should be no variation in the equalization payment
    ordered by the trial judge. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    regard to all the circumstances, and bearing in mind that the court is exercising
    a fairness function in this narrow context, I have concluded that the net
    outstanding equalization payment should be fixed at $900,000.  I say this
    for the following reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    accept that the amount of Mr. Serra’s net equalization payment must be reduced
    substantially from the amount ordered by the trial judge.  However, I would
    not reduce it mechanically to the suggested $656,000 by simply applying the
    reduced trial-date valuation of Ajax Textiles.  Instead, I would make an
    upward adjustment of approximately $250,000 in that amount.  I do so to give
    better effect in particular to these considerations: (i) the possibility,
    however remote, of a modest turn around in the fortunes of the Ajax Textiles
    business; (ii) the length of the Serra’s marriage; (iii) the principle of
    dividing matrimonial property in a way that recognizes the equal contribution
    of spouses to the accumulation of wealth during a marriage; and, (iv) a desire
    not simply to substitute a trial-date valuation for the separation-date valuation
    in the circumstances of this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Legislature chose the date of separation, principally, as the valuation date
    for purposes of establishing the equalization of net family property in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario.  In doing so, it gave effect to the “equal contribution to the marriage” tenet
    by measuring the accumulation of wealth during the marriage as the difference
    between the value at separation and the value of property brought into the
    marriage.  The same theory does not apply to post-separation date valuations
    because what happens to an asset after that point – whether its value goes
    up or down – is not related to contributions within the marriage context.  In
    addition, a trial-date valuation is somewhat random in that it depends upon
    the time it takes the parties to get ready for trial and the vagaries of
    the trial scheduling system.  As well, it may be open to manipulation by
    parties seeking the most advantageous timing.  I note that there is no suggestion
    on the record here that Mr. Serra sought to manipulate the timing of the
    trial for these purposes.  Notwithstanding this, and while there may be cases
    where it would be appropriate to apply a straight trial-date valuation approach
    in these kinds of circumstances, I do not think this is one of them.</p>

    and Ms. Serra had a long-term marriage of over 24 years.  While it seems
    unlikely that Ajax Textiles will ever return to its highly profitable heydays,
    Mr. Serra testified that he was optimistic he could make the business profitable
    once again.  It seems unfair – particularly given the length of the marriage,
    the principles underlying the <i>Family Law Act</i>, and Ms. Serra’s sometimes
    role in the business – to saddle her with the entire downside of the business’ decline
    while Mr. Serra retains at least the possibility, however remote, of enjoying
    some upside in the future.  At the time of trial, Mr. Serra’s shareholdings
    in the business were valued at between $1.875 million and $2.6 million.  The
    adjustment I propose represents roughly 10%-15% of that range – depending
    on where one settles on the spectrum – and is designed to reflect the foregoing
    factors while still recognizing the dramatic negative impact of the decline
    in the textile business on Mr. Serra’s net worth.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    an alternative mechanism for the satisfaction of his equalization payment

    to an amount equal to the value of his 50% interest in the

    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Florida condominium.  By this I take him to mean that he is willing to transfer
    his interest in that property to Ms. Serra in full satisfaction of his equalization

    willing to let her have the

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    resolution that would involve the satisfaction of Mr. Serra’s equalization
    payment obligation, in whole or in part, through some form of disposition
    of the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Florida condominium is attractive at a number of levels.  Such a resolution
    could be accomplished either through the transfer of Mr. Serra’s one-half
    interest in the property to Ms. Serra or through the sale of the property
    and the distribution of some or all of Mr. Serra’s share of the proceeds
    in full or partial satisfaction of his obligation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Either
    solution would have the benefit of addressing two outstanding issues between
    the parties: resolution of the equalization payment obligation and the problem
    of joint ownership of the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Florida condominium.  A transfer of interest would in effect secure payment
    of all, or at least a significant portion, of the equalization payment due
    to Ms. Serra, while at the same time enabling her – if she so wishes – to
    retain the Florida property which she continues to enjoy.  At the same time
    it would permit Mr. Serra to satisfy his equalization payment obligation
    without further depleting his other remaining assets or the business.  On
    the other hand there are problems, as I see it, with any solution tying satisfaction
    of the equalization payment to the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Florida property, with one exception. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The
    exception entails granting Ms. Serra the option of accepting a transfer of
    Mr. Serra’s interest in <u>full</u> satisfaction of his equalization payment
    obligation.  This alternative is appealing because it would resolve both
    the equalization payment and condominium problems cleanly.  It would not
    require a joint valuation, or competing valuations, of the property – a source
    of potential friction and further legal proceedings between the parties.  Ms.
    Serra can make the call with or without her own valuation.  She can decide
    whether she wishes to keep the property and whether Mr. Serra’s one-half
    interest is presently adequate to satisfy her equalization claim or whether
    she should bank on it becoming adequate, or more than adequate, in the future.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But
    what if she decides not to accept this alternative, as she may well do either
    because of her view of the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State

    Florida real estate market or for liquidity reasons?    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s decision permits Mr. Serra to transfer his interest in the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Florida property and to receive credit for the value of that interest as
    against his equalization payment obligation.  Another possibility would be
    to allow Ms. Serra to require him to do so, again preserving for her the
    option of keeping the property if she so desires.  There are practical problems
    in relation to both of these options, however.  Neither can fairly be <u>forced</u> onto
    the non-consenting party without an acceptable or binding valuation of the
    interest.  As noted above, valuations are undoubtedly a potential source
    of further conflict, cost and delay.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the other hand, absent Ms. Serra’s acceptance of a transfer in full satisfaction
    of the claim, no other solution involving the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Florida property avoids the potential of continuing conflict between the
    parties.  A sale of the property – whatever the use of the proceeds – will
    require a valuation process too and some interplay between the parties with
    respect to the procedure for such an exercise in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Florida.  In the end, I am satisfied that the only workable alternative tying
    satisfaction of the equalization payment to the Florida condominium is the
    one providing Ms. Serra with the option of accepting a transfer of Mr. Serra’s
    interest in full satisfaction of his equalization payment obligation.  Any
    other such solution runs the risk of the court imposing a disposition that
    may require the parties to make choices that are complicated by disadvantageous
    foreign law or other implications of which we cannot be aware.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    recognize that, absent the exercise by Ms. Serra of that option, the parties
    are left in the position of being joint beneficial owners of the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Florida condominium, with no resolution of the problems arising from that
    relationship in this proceeding.  The parties are not deprived of whatever
    remedies they may have in that regard, however.</p>
  <p>Transfer of Shares</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is a further alternative option that warrants consideration in terms of a
    fair and equitable disposition of the s. 5(6) problem.  Could the equalization
    payment be satisfied – as Mr. Serra proposed on the appeal, albeit in the
    context of the constructive trust issue – by way of the transfer to Ms. Serra
    of 1,000 common shares in 821129 Ontario Limited together with a smaller
    payment of approximately $623,000?  Such an option, again, would be reflective
    of the potential for a positive turnaround in the Ajax Textiles business.  This
    option could potentially be an alternative to the options above involving
    the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Florida condominium. In the end, however, I do not believe that this alternative
    option is preferable. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    was Mr. Serra’s first position on the appeal that this Court should overturn
    the trial judge’s finding that there was no constructive trust and order
    that he holds 1,000 common shares of 821129 Ontario Limited by way of a resulting
    and/or constructive trust for Ms. Serra, thereby reducing the outstanding
    amount of the equalization payment from the trial judge’s determination of
    approximately $3.3 million to approximately $623,000.  For reasons explained
    elsewhere in this judgment, I do not propose to interfere with the trial
    judge’s disposition with respect to the trust claims.  However, it could
    be argued that Mr. Serra cannot complain about the inequities of permitting
    the very option he sought to have granted on the appeal in the exercise of
    the court’s limited fairness jurisdiction under s. 5(6).  And it would provide
    Ms. Serra with more than two-thirds of her equalization payment in cash and,
    as noted above, afford her some prospect of participating in a possible upswing
    in the value of the Ajax Textile business.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    potential solution poses its own difficulties as well, however.  If forced
    on Ms. Serra, it would require her to accept at least partial satisfaction
    of her equalization claim in a form that she may not want, and would place
    her in a minority shareholder position that she may not want.  If forced
    on Mr. Serra, it would leave him with his former wife as a minority shareholder
    in the business – a situation that would open the potential for further friction
    between them.  I am not aware of anything in the record that would enable
    us to assess the value of a minority interest, if one were to apply a minority
    discount.  Moreover, what restrictions, if any, would need to be imposed
    if Ms. Serra were subsequently to sell that interest in what is a family
    run business?  Would Mr. Serra be entitled to a first option to purchase
    them?  Would a “shotgun”
    provision be required for such a transaction?  These and many other commercial
    considerations make it unwise for a court – which is not equipped to do so
    in my view– to seek to construct or impose such an arrangement on the parties.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For

    the end of the day, then, the viable options with respect to the satisfaction
    of Mr. Serra’s equalization payment are reduced to two:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>a)   Ms. Serra is to have the option of accepting
    a transfer of Mr. Serra’s one-half interest in the
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    Serra of her decision in this regard on or before the close of business,
    5 p.m. E.S.T., on March 6, 2009.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>b)   Failing the exercise of that option, Mr. Serra
    is to pay to Ms. Serra the equalization payment of $900,000 in three instalments
    of $300,000, on March 31, 2009, December 31, 2009 and September 30, 2010.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    conclusion, the market-driven decline in the value of Mr. Serra’s interest
    in Ajax Textiles – his major and only significant income-producing asset – and
    the circumstances surrounding it, are factors to be considered under s. 5(6)(h)
    of the <i>Family Law Act</i> because, on the facts of this case, they relate
    to the disposition, preservation and maintenance of that asset.  The trial
    judge erred in holding that “the circumstances in which a court may order
    an unequal division of net family property under s. 5(6) do not include a
    market-driven decline in the value of the property.”  To the contrary, in
    combination with other relevant considerations in this case – Ms. Serra’s
    claim to a trust interest in the assets, the preservation order obtained,
    the need to preserve and maintain the business in order to satisfy Mr. Serra’s
    interim payment obligations, and the fact that Ms. Serra is not without means – those
    factors point compellingly to the conclusion that the equal division of Mr.
    and Ms. Serra’s net family properties would lead to an unconscionable result.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Such
    a result would not give proper effect to the purpose and language of s. 5(6)
    the <i>Family Law Act</i>, in my view<i>.</i>  I would therefore allow the
    appeal on this ground and reduce the amount of the equalization payment remaining
    to be made by Mr. Serra from $3,283,272.57 – as ordered by the trial judge – to
    the amount of $900,000, to be satisfied by way of one of the alternative
    mechanisms outlined above.  I consider this disposition to be fair, just
    and equitable in the circumstances.</p>

    Mr. Serra’s ability to deal with his textile business assets.  Although Mr.

    her trust claims.  At the same time, she declined to act upon Mr. Serra’s
    formal admission.  She felt it was unfair for either position to prevail
    at that stage.  The trial judge proceeded to try the issue and found on the
    evidence that there was no constructive trust, principally because, in her
    view, Ms. Serra had been “very well compensated” overall for her contributions
    to the business, and had not suffered any deprivation as a result.  She did
    not deal with the resulting trust claim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the current family law regime, the proper way to withdraw all or part of
    a claim is to file a formal Notice of Withdrawal under Rule 12(1) of the <i>Family
    Law Rules</i>.  It would appear that this can be done unilaterally at any
    stage of the proceedings, unlike under the comparable provision in civil
    cases where leave of the court is necessary once the pleadings are closed.<a href="#_ftn19"

    Rule 12(3) the withdrawing party is liable for the costs in relation to the
    withdrawn claim “unless the court orders or the parties agree otherwise.”  Thus,
    if the withdrawing party seeks to avoid the cost consequences flowing from
    the withdrawal, that party must persuade the court to make an order avoiding
    or minimizing the costs.  Perhaps with this in mind, Ms. Serra did not resort
    to the Rule but simply applied to the trial judge for leave to withdraw.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Parties
    should be encouraged to comply with the Rules.  However, I do not think the
    existence of Rule 12(1) deprived the court of jurisdiction to deal with Ms.
    Serra’s request.  I am satisfied that the trial judge had a residual discretion,
    pursuant to the court’s inherent jurisdiction to control its own process,
    to consider Ms. Serra’s application.  She did so after considering all the
    circumstances – essentially on the basis that “it would… be unfair… to permit
    Ms. Serra to prevent a determination of this [trust] issue now that there
    [had] been a decline in the value of the company” – and I can find no error
    in the exercise of her discretion in that regard.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More
    problematic is her decision not to accept Mr. Serra’s withdrawal of his defence
    and his admission that he holds 1,000 common shares of 821129 Ontario Inc.
    in trust for Ms. Serra.  Rule 12(1) permits a party to withdraw all or part
    of an answer at any time, without leave.<a

'>[20]</span></span></span></span></a>  Mr. Serra took advantage of this Rule.  Moreover,
    he not only withdrew his defence to the trust claims in his answer; he coupled
    the withdrawal with an unequivocal admission that he holds 1,000 common shares
    of 821129 Ontario Inc. in trust for Ms. Serra.  Is a court at liberty simply
    to cast aside that withdrawal and admission?  The answer to that question
    is not as straightforward as it might seem at first blush.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is ample authority for the proposition that a
    “formal admission is conclusive as to the matter admitted, and cannot be
    withdrawn except by leave of the court or the consent of the party in whose
    favour it was made”: <i>Marchand (Litigation Guardian of) v. Public General
    Hospital Society of Chatham</i> (2000), 51 O.R. (3d) 97 (C.A.), at para.
    77, citing Sopinka, Lederman and Bryant, <i>The Law of Evidence in Canada</i>,
    3<sup>rd</sup> ed. (Toronto:
    <st1:PersonName w:st="on">
    Butterworths, 1999).  In that text, the authors state, at p. 1051:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A formal admission in civil proceedings is a concession
    made by a party to the proceedings that a certain <i>fact or issue</i> is
    not in dispute.  <i>Formal admissions</i> made for the purpose of dispensing
    with proof at trial <i>are conclusive as to the matters admitted</i>.  As
    to these matters, <i>other evidence is precluded</i> as being irrelevant
    but, if such evidence is adduced, the court is bound to act on the admission
    even if the evidence contradicts it. [Emphasis added; footnotes omitted.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,
    however, Mr. Serra does not seek to withdraw his admission.  Indeed, the
    contrary is the case: he seeks to rely upon it.  The trial judge nonetheless
    deprived him of the benefit of it.  Was she entitled to do so?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    some consideration, I have concluded that the trial judge retained the authority
    to require the trial of the trust issue in spite of the withdrawal of Mr.
    Serra’s defence to it and his admission.  While I might not have arrived
    at the same decision, she exercised her discretion in this regard and I cannot
    say that she erred in the circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Just
    as parties are generally bound by the admissions they make, as against the
    party or parties in whose favour they are made, they should generally be
    entitled to rely on those admissions as well.  Under Rule 12(1) parties are
    entitled to withdraw all or part of a claim or an answer, without leave,
    and they should generally be entitled to rely upon such a withdrawal as well.  Were
    this not the case, the useful practice of obtaining and providing admissions
    and of narrowing the issues in dispute for purposes of trial would be rendered
    ineffectual.  The purpose of this practice is to dispense with proof at trial,
    and to minimize the cost of litigation and the areas of dispute between the
    parties.  For legitimate policy reasons, these objectives are to be encouraged.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    said, the withdrawal of an answer or defence does not necessarily lead to
    judgment.  The facts as pleaded, or as otherwise found in the record, must
    support the judgment sought.  In this regard, the trial judge found the provisions
    of Rule 19.06 of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i> helpful by way of analogy.  Rule
    19.06 states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A plaintiff is not entitled to judgment on a motion
    for judgment or at trial merely because the facts alleged in the statement
    of claim are deemed to be admitted, unless the facts entitle the plaintiff
    to judgment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, admissions are not irrevocably cast in stone.  While conclusive
    as long as they stand – at least as to the facts involved – they can in some
    circumstances be withdrawn.  Sopinka, Lederman and Bryant say at pp. 1051-1052
    that a formal admission of fact, as distinct from an admission of law, cannot
    be withdrawn except by leave of the court or on consent, whereas an admission
    relating solely to a question of law can be withdrawn at any time.  See also, <i>Highley
    v. C.P.R.</i> (1930) 64 O.L.R. 615 (

    a running scale, then, admissions of fact would appear to be well-entrenched
    once freely made, admissions of mixed fact and law less so, and admissions
    of law the most easily displaced.  Here, Mr. Serra’s admission that he holds
    1,000 common shares in trust for Ms. Serra is an admission of mixed fact
    and law.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[113]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    substance, the trial judge refused to be bound by Mr. Serra’s admission because
    she thought it was unfair to take the trust issue off the table at that stage
    in the proceedings but, at the same time, that the issue should be determined
    at trial rather than by either permitting Ms. Serra to withdraw the claims
    altogether or by permitting Mr. Serra simply to admit them.  At para. 61
    of her reasons for judgment – referring back to her separate reasons on Ms.
    Serra’s motion for leave to withdraw her trust claims – she said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Citing the cases of A<i>rshinoff v. Arshinoff</i>,

    the same time, it would be unfair to permit Mr. Serra to prevent the issue
    from being heard on its merits by filing an admission that Ms. Serra did,
    indeed, have such an interest.  <i>In the result, I decided that the issue
    should be resolved on its merits, after having heard evidence at trial.</i> [Emphasis

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[114]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    adopting this stance, the trial judge remained true to a theme running through
    the jurisprudence relating to the withdrawal of admissions of mixed fact
    and law: an admission may be withdrawn if, in all the circumstances, there
    is a triable issue that ought to be tried in the interests of justice rather
    than left to an admission of fact: see <i>Norlympia Seafoods Ltd. v. Dale &amp; Co.</i> (1982),
    141 D.L.R. (3d) 733 (B.C.C.A.), at pp. 735-737; <i>Gardiner v. Minister of

    in the circumstances, the court is satisfied that it is in the interest of
    justice to withdraw same.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the principles cited above have evolved in circumstances where it is the
    person making the admission who seeks to withdraw it or to lead evidence
    contradicting the admission, I see no reason why they are not applicable
    to situations like the case at bar.  Mr. Serra is not seeking to withdraw
    his admission or to resile from the withdrawal of his answer to the trust
    claims.  The principle remains valid nonetheless: although the fact of the
    admission and the circumstances surrounding it may influence the court’s
    determination of what effect to give to it, the court is not bound to give
    effect to an admission of law, or of mixed fact and law, if in all the circumstances
    the interests of justice dictate that the issue should be determined at a
    trial rather than by way of admission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[116]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    court must control its own process, particularly in family law matters and
    particularly when it comes to the granting of equitable remedies.  The declaration
    of a constructive trust or a resulting trust is an equitable remedy.  Here,
    then, it was open to the trial judge, in the exercise of her residual discretion,
    to require the trust issue to be determined at trial, as she did.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge reviewed the evidence carefully and ultimately concluded that
    it did not support the finding of a constructive trust. While there was ample
    evidence of Ms. Serra’s contribution to the business, and therefore of Mr.
    Serra’s indirect benefit from that contribution, Ms. Serra did not suffer
    a corresponding deprivation as a result of her contributions because she
    was “well compensated for her efforts” throughout by reasons of the salary
    she received, the very comfortable – indeed, luxurious –
    lifestyle she enjoyed, and the considerable increase in her assets during
    the marriage.  The criteria for a constructive trust – namely an unjust enrichment,
    a corresponding deprivation, and the absence of any juristic reason for the
    enrichment – had not been satisfied: <i>Rawluk v. Rawluk</i>, [1990] 1 S.C.R.
    70 at p. 97; <i>Sorochan v. Sorochan,</i> [1986] 2 S.C.R. 38.  This finding
    was open to the trial judge on the evidence.  There is no basis for interfering
    with it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[118]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    result would not differ, even if one were to take the view that Mr. Serra’s
    admission should remain intact at least to the extent that the facts underlying
    it, and pleaded in Ms. Serra’s statement of claim, must be taken as true,
    and that evidence beyond the admission and pleading should not have been
    considered: see <i>The Law of Evidence</i>, p. 1051.  The facts relied on
    by the trial judge in concluding that there was no constructive trust were
    in substance set out in the statement of claim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[119]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge did not apply her mind to the resulting trust issue.  I do not
    think this matters in the end.  Although Ms. Serra claimed a declaration
    that she was entitled to a proprietary interest in Mr. Serra’s assets “by
    way of a resulting, implied or constructive trust”, her claim as pleaded
    was either a constructive trust claim or it was not a constructive trust
    claim.  It was not pleaded on the basis that there was a common intention
    to share the assets and, as a consequence, a resulting trust.  </p>

    paid by the company or withdrawals from his director’s loan account) and
    the amount of income the business can bear.  She accepted that, given the
    reverses in his business, he was unable to support the lifestyle that he
    supported prior to separation.  She concluded, however, that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[208] Mr. Serra has shown a remarkable ability

    a variety of mechanisms, including the establishment of a complex corporate
    structure, trust funds, a Swiss bank account, bonus payments, payments from
    his advance account, salaries declared to himself and to his spouses, loans
    and mortgages.  While his ability and flexibility have been affected by the
    losses incurred by his business, he has, nonetheless, been able to manage
    his affairs, support his family, and make various payments, including spousal
    support payments, even in the years when the company was losing money.  He
    was able to buy out Ms. Serra’s interest in the home in

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[127]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    he and Ms. Serra separated, Mr. Serra’s primary source of income was from
    bonuses derived from the profits of his business.  He kept a portion of the
    bonus and returned the bulk of it to the company by way of a director’s loan.  That
    loan has currently been exhausted in an effort to keep Ajax Textiles afloat
    and satisfy his support obligations.  After the commencement of these proceedings,
    and the interim support order of Sachs J., however, Mr. Serra began taking
    a salary from the company in order to take the tax benefits in relation to
    those payments.  The evidence shows that from January 2003 to May 2006 (when
    he ceased paying spousal support to Ms. Serra), his annual salary from the
    company was about $250,000.  It fell to $135,000 when his payments ceased.  His
    current wife receives a salary of $29,000 per year for income-splitting purposes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[128]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    these circumstances, I see no error in the trial judge’s decision to impute
    an annual income of $250,000 to Mr. Serra for purposes of determining his
    support payments.  I would not interfere with the support order in this regard.</p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>Post-Judgment Interest</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[129]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    post-judgement interest ground of appeal was based on the premise that, having
    ordered Mr. Serra to pay an equalization payment and spousal support that
    he has no ability to pay, the trial judge erred in law by awarding post-judgment
    interest.  The complaint is therefore of little moment, given the above determination
    with respect to the equalization payment.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[130]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    any event, post-judgment interest is a matter of discretion.  I would not
    interfere with the trial judge’s decision, particularly in view of the level
    of payments Mr. Serra will now be required to make.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[131]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the foregoing reasons, I would allow the appeal in part and order that the
    net equalization payment to be made by Mr. Serra be reduced from $3,283,272.57,
    as ordered by the trial judge, to $900,000.00.  This obligation may be satisfied
    in one of the following ways:</p>

    satisfaction of her equalization payment claim. She is to notify Mr. Serra
    of her decision in this regard by 5 p.m. E.S.T. on March 6, 2009.  The costs
    of the transfer are to be shared equally. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Failing
    the exercise of the foregoing option, Mr. Serra shall pay to Ms. Serra an
    equalization payment of $900,000 payable in three instalments of $300,000
    each, on March 31, 2009, December 31, 2009 and September 30, 2010, together
    with post-judgment interest in accordance with the order of the trial judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[132]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Some
    changes are required in the support payments provided in the trial judge’s
    order as a result of the foregoing.  Her order is therefore varied to provide
    that Mr. Serra shall pay to Ms. Serra spousal support in the amount of $10,000
    per month until the earlier of either of the following: (a) Mr. Serra’s interest
    in the Florida Condominium is transferred to Ms. Serra in satisfaction of
    his net equalization payment, or (b) the net equalization payment is otherwise
    satisfied by payment of the full amount outstanding.  Thereafter, Mr. Serra
    shall pay Ms. Serra spousal support of $7,500 per month for a further period
    of two years from the triggering event above noted, after which either party
    may apply for a review of spousal support, to be determined on a <i>de novo</i> basis.</p>
