    appellant appeals his conviction and sentence by Valin J. for break and enter
    of a dwelling house with intent to commit an indictable offence, uttering
    a threat to cause bodily harm and possession of a weapon for a purpose dangerous
    to the public peace.  The appellant’s grounds of appeal against conviction
    are that the identification evidence was unreliable and that he was prejudiced
    in his defence because the alleged weapon, a nightstick, was lost.  He also
    submits that the sentence of four years imprisonment was excessive.</p>

      FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    July 5, 2004, the victim of the offence, a member of the
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>
    military stationed at
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    North Bay, was asleep in a home that she had rented.  She had worked an evening
    shift and was sleeping in the living room when she was awakened by a noise
    at about 2:30 p.m.  She was confronted by a man standing in the living room.  The
    man had a nightstick in his hand and asked her where “Aaron” was.  She told
    the man her name, that she was with the military and lived alone.  The man
    identified himself as “Marcel” and said to tell Aaron that he was going to
    come back and when he did Aaron would be sorry.  The complainant repeated
    that nobody named Aaron lived there.  The man said that he knew Aaron was
    there because he saw his clothes.  When the complainant was talking to the
    man, he was about seven feet away.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    man then left. The complainant looked outside the window and saw a car parked
    outside.  She saw a woman in the driver’s seat and a third person in the
    back seat.  The intruder got into the front passenger seat.  The complainant
    noted the licence number and called 911.  She gave the licence number to
    the police as AMACH 769.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    appears that “Aaron” was the landlord’s son as the landlord had told the
    complainant that she might get some of Aaron’s mail.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    about 5:50 p.m., there was a second incident.  The complainant heard banging
    on her front door and back door and on the side kitchen window.  She immediately
    called 911.  Just prior to the police attending she saw the same intruder
    getting into the same car.  The same woman was driving and there was a third
    person in the back seat.  The police arrived immediately and she saw them
    arrest the intruder.  The vehicle bore licence number AKCH 769.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, the complainant testified that at the preliminary inquiry she had
    been shown a nightstick that was the same as the one the intruder had held
    during the first confrontation.  She described it as about 12 inches long
    and black.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant identified the appellant as the intruder on the first occasion
    and the man who had been banging on her doors and windows on the second occasion.  There
    was never any line-up or other identification procedure; it appears that
    the complainant identified the appellant for the first time at the preliminary
    inquiry and then again at the trial.  She did, however, provide a description
    of the intruder to the police:  grey longish hair, (which she meant was longer
    than military style, but not down to the shoulders), well-kept, thin build,
    late forties, five foot “tenish”.  She did not note any moustache or that
    the intruder was wearing glasses. The appellant has neat grey hair and a
    moustache but is shorter than 5’10”. He usually wears glasses.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    the police attended on the second occasion, they found three people at the
    car:  the appellant, Chantal Larocque and Derrick Andryechen.  The appellant
    was sitting in the front passenger seat.  Larocque was outside the vehicle
    and Andryechen was in the rear passenger seat.  The police found a black
    nightstick poking out from underneath the front passenger seat.  The nightstick
    was entered into evidence at the preliminary inquiry but afterwards went
    missing.  Constable Brunette described the nightstick as about a foot- and-a-half
    long, black with etching by the grip.  Constable Brunette described Andryechen
    as being 5’7” to 5’10” tall, and bald on the top of his head with long grey
    hair down to his shoulders “like the clown look”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    a <i>voir dire</i>, a videotaped statement that the appellant gave to the
    police was found to be admissible.  In the statement, the appellant admitted
    that he had been in the house the first time, but claimed that he was invited
    in.  He denied having the nightstick, and said that “all I did is I asked
    if Aaron was there because apparently he wanted to see me and she said no
    he is not.  I said that is fine we will go and do some groceries, I might
    drop in later and that is what we did”.  The appellant insisted that he did
    not do anything wrong.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant did not testify at the trial.</p>

  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the identification evidence is unreliable; that the
    description given by the complainant does not fit his appearance but rather
    that of Andryechen.  We do not agree.  There were some minor discrepancies
    in the description the complainant gave to the police and the appellant’s
    appearance.  However, the complainant explained the most significant discrepancy
    about the long hair.  The trial judge was entitled to accept her explanation.  It
    is apparent that Andryechen’s hair is entirely different from that described
    by the complainant.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    any event, the case did not rest solely on the complainant’s identification
    evidence.  The appellant admitted in his statement that he was in the home
    on the first occasion and he was arrested in the vehicle that was at the
    home on the two occasions.  It is apparent that it was the same vehicle despite
    the slight difference in the licence plate number as recorded by the complainant.  On
    both occasions the intruder got back into the front passenger seat, where
    the appellant was found by the police.  The appellant also admitted in his
    statement that he was looking for “Aaron”.  Further, the complainant testified
    that the intruder identified himself as “Marcel”, the appellant’s first name.  Finally,
    the nightstick was found underneath the appellant’s seat. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The
      Missing Nightstick</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that he was denied a fair trial because the nightstick
    that was seized from the car and entered as an exhibit at the preliminary
    inquiry was not available at the trial.  The appellant submits that he would
    have been able to show that the complainant’s description of the nightstick
    was different from its actual appearance.  We would not give effect to this
    ground of appeal.  The nightstick was available at the preliminary inquiry
    and defence counsel asked no questions of the complainant about it at that
    time.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the trial, the police officer who found the nightstick described it and the
    discrepancy between that description and the description given by the complainant
    was before the trial judge.  We can see no way in which the appellant’s case
    was compromised because the actual nightstick was not available at the trial.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE
      SENTENCE APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge sentenced the appellant to a total of four years imprisonment.  The
    appellant has a criminal record beginning in 1971, which includes a number
    of drug offences and one conviction for assault.  As the trial judge noted,
    it was apparent that the appellant entered the home in an attempt to collect
    a drug debt and to use force for that purpose.  He brandished a weapon and
    impliedly threatened to cause harm to “Aaron”.  This was a home invasion
    and required a sentence stressing deterrence and denunciation.  The trial
    judge referred to the appropriate mitigating and aggravating factors, including
    the fact that the offence was of relatively brief duration and that no force
    was used to enter the dwelling, because the door was unlocked.  We see no
    error in principle and have not been persuaded that the sentence is outside
    the appropriate range.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>DISPOSITION</span></h4>

line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the appeal from conviction is dismissed.  Leave to appeal sentence is granted
    but the appeal is dismissed.</p>
