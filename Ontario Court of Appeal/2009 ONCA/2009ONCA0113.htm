      Traffic Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.H8 (“<i>HTA</i>”), is a comprehensive statute
      regulating drivers and vehicles in

    Ontario.  The anchor of the statute is, as its title suggests, “highways”.  The

    to protecting the travelling public who use the highways.</p>

    appeal poses two questions relating to the interpretation of the <i>HTA</i>.  Is
    a parking lot in a small strip mall a
    “highway” within the definition set out in s. 1(1) of the <i>HTA</i>?  If
    a person pleads guilty to offences under the <i>HTA</i>, do the factual admissions
    that ground the pleas bind a court, in a subsequent civil trial, on the basis
    of issue estoppel or <i>res judicata</i>?  Justice Peter Jarvis of the Superior
    Court of Justice answered both questions ‘No’.  The appellant insurance company
    appeals from his judgment.</p>

    December 19, 2000, Bethily Becamon drove from her home to a small strip mall
    located at
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    336 Wilson Avenue in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Toronto.  Becamon possessed a G1 licence.  A condition of the licence was
    that she had to be accompanied by a fully licensed driver with at least four
    years’ driving experience in the seat beside her.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Becamon
    chose (for the first time) to drive alone, in clear contravention of her
    licence.  She drove several kilometres on
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto streets and eventually entered the strip mall.  She attempted to
    park her vehicle, but stepped on the gas pedal instead of the brake.  The
    vehicle mounted the sidewalk and hit a pedestrian, Mian Daud Shah, in front
    of the Bagel World store.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Shah
    sued Becamon for damages resulting from injuries sustained in the accident.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Prior
    to the accident, Becamon obtained automobile insurance from Wawanesa Mutual
    Insurance Company (“Wawanesa”) pursuant to a standard Ontario Automobile
    Policy. 
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <i>Ontario</i><i> Regulation 777/93</i> under the <i>Insurance Act</i>, R.S.O.
    1990, c. I. 8, sets out statutory conditions that are a part of every insurance
    policy.  Statutory Condition 4(1) provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>4(1) The insured shall not drive or operate or
    permit any other person to drive or operate the automobile unless the insured
    or other person is <i>authorized by law</i> to drive or operate it.  [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the scene of the accident, Becamon was charged under the <i>HTA</i> with
    the offences of driving in contravention of conditions (she was not wearing
    her prescription glasses) and driving without being accompanied by a qualified
    driver.  She pleaded guilty to these charges on January 8, 2001 and paid
    a $105 fine for each offence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the civil action, Wawanesa refused to defend or indemnify Becamon on the
    basis that she had violated her G1 licence restriction by driving alone,
    which in turn amounted to a breach of the “authorized by law”
    component of Statutory Condition 4(1).  Thus Wawanesa’s position was that
    the limit of its policy coverage for the accident caused by its client Becamon
    was $200,000, not the $1,000,000 that would have been in play had Becamon
    been authorized to drive alone when the accident occurred.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Becamon
    brought a third party action against Wawanesa seeking a declaration that
    Wawanesa had a duty to defend and indemnify her in the main action.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>            (2) <u>The trial
        judgment</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge granted the declaration sought by Becamon.  In so doing, he rejected
    Wawanesa’s two main arguments.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    Wawanesa contended that Becamon’s guilty plea to the <i>HTA</i> charge of
    violating her G1 licence restriction by driving alone constituted an admission
    that her conduct was not authorized by law on the day of the accident.  It
    followed that the doctrines of issue estoppel and <i>res judicata</i> precluded
    Becamon from arguing to the contrary in the civil trial with respect to the
    words
    “authorized by law” in Statutory Condition 4(1) of the insurance policy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge did not accept this submission.  He stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There was no evidence to show whether Ms. Becamon
    was represented by counsel.  In addition, Ms. Becamon has obvious problems
    with the English language.  It would be unfair for me to assign weight to
    guilty pleas in determining the coverage and statutory condition issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    Wawanesa  argued that the strip mall was a &ldquo;highway&rdquo; within the definition set out in s.  1(1) of the <em>HTA,</em> thus triggering&nbsp; Becamon&rsquo;s non-compliance with the &ldquo;authorized  by law&rdquo; component of Statutory Condition 4(1) of the insurance policy. &nbsp;Section 1(1) of the <em>HTA</em> provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1(1)  In the Act,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>“highway” includes  a common and public highway, street, avenue, parkway, driveway, square, place,  bridge, viaduct or trestle, any part of which is intended for or used by the  general public for the passage of vehicles and includes the area between the  lateral property lines thereof; (&ldquo;voie publique&rdquo;)</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge rejected this argument.  He reasoned:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Ms. Becamon entered the mall deliberately and loss
    of control or negligence occurred entirely on private property and the <i>Highway
    Traffic Act</i> can have no application.  That is to say Ms. Becamon did
    not require the authority in law to drive in that place at that time, therefore,
    it cannot be said to have been a breach of the statutory condition.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Wawanesa
    appeals the trial judge’s judgment.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='

    trial judge erred by concluding that Becamon’s guilty pleas to the <i>HTA</i> offences

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Becamon
    pleaded guilty to two offences under the <i>HTA</i>, one of which was violating
    her G1 licence restriction by driving alone.  The appellant submits that
    in light of these guilty pleas, Becamon admitted that she was not authorized
    by law to drive.  Accordingly, she was estopped from taking a contrary position
    at the trial in this civil action.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Evidence
    of a prior conviction affords only <i>prima facie</i> proof of guilt in subsequent
    civil proceedings: see <i>Re Del Core and Ontario College of Pharmacists</i> (1985),
    51 O.R. (2d) 1 (
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  The presumption is rebuttable in the civil proceeding where relitigation
    of the issue that gave rise to the guilty plea in the criminal proceeding
    does not constitute an abuse of process: see
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <i>Toronto</i><i> (City) v. C.U.P.E., Local 79</i>, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 77 (“<i>C.U.P.E</i>.”).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>C.U.P.E.</i>,
    Arbour J. enunciated the need to strike a balance between finality and fairness
    and provided illustrations pointing towards the fairness side of the scales,
    at paras. 52 and 53:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[F]rom the system’s point of view, relitigation
    carries serious detrimental effects and should be avoided unless the circumstances
    dictate that relitigation is in fact necessary to enhance the credibility
    and the effectiveness of the adjudicative process as a whole.  <i>There may
    be instances where relitigation will enhance, rather than impeach, the integrity
    of the judicial system, for example: …(3) where fairness dictates that the
    original result should not be binding in the new context.</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>. . .</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The discretionary factors that apply to prevent
    the doctrine of issue estoppel from operating in an unjust or unfair way
    are equally available to prevent the doctrine of abuse of process from achieving
    a similar undesirable result.  There are many circumstances in which the
    bar against relitigation, either through the doctrine of <i>res judicata</i> or
    that of abuse of process, would create unfairness.  <i>If, for instance,
    the stakes of the original proceeding were too minor to generate a full and
    robust response, while the subsequent stakes were considerable, fairness
    would dictate that the administration of justice would be better served by
    permitting the second proceeding to go forward than by insisting that finality
    should prevail.</i>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    two emphasized sentences in this passage support the trial judge’s decision
    not to apply the doctrines of issue estoppel and <i>res judicata</i> in this
    case.  The stakes in Becamon’s guilty pleas for the two <i>HTA</i> offences
    were not high; she did not have to become involved in protracted legal proceedings
    and she paid relatively small fines.  On the other hand, the stakes in the
    present civil action, which will probably be long, complex and costly, are
    much greater – compensation potentially in the hundreds of thousands of dollars
    for an innocent pedestrian.  In my view, this dichotomy of process and consequences
    suggests that, in the words of Arbour J. in <i>C.U.P.E.</i>, “fairness dictates
    that the original result should not be binding in the new context.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, I record my agreement with two of the factors mentioned by the
    trial judge – the likelihood that Becamon was not represented by counsel
    in relation to her guilty pleas on the <i>HTA</i> charges and her difficulties
    with the English language.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant contends that the latter point was an unsubstantiated inference.  I
    disagree.  The trial record discloses that Becamon testified with the assistance
    of a Tagalog interpreter.  Moreover, when the interpreter did not show up
    on the second day of the trial, counsel were concerned and worked cooperatively
    to place a proper record of testimony and documents before the trial judge.  Thus
    the trial judge’s conclusion was supported by both his own observation and
    the circumstances surrounding Becamon’s testimony.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>            (2) <u>The parking
        lot as a “highway”</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    entire <i>HTA</i>, including the graduated licensing system, is limited to “highways”.  Thus
    the essential question on this appeal, in terms of determining whether Becamon’s
    driving in the strip mall was
    “authorized by law”, is whether or not, when the accident occurred, Becamon
    was driving on a “highway”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    convenience, I set out again the definition of

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>“highway” includes a <i>common and public</i> highway,

    trial judge concluded that the accident took place on private property, not
    a highway.  In so doing, he relied extensively on two decisions, <i>Gill
    v. Elwood</i>, [1970] 2 O.R. 59, and <i>R. v. Mansour</i>, [1979] 2 S.C.R.
    916.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Gill
      v. Elwood</i> is a case very similar to the present appeal.  It involved
      a small mall with an entrance, exit and marked parking spaces.  This court
      held that the premises were not a highway.  Aylesworth J.A. said, at pp.
      59-60:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Something first we think should be said about the
    nature of the premises which it is sought to be made a highway or part of
    the highway and the use thereof.  The premises involved consist of a large
    area upon which are delineated ways or routes, including an exit and an entrance
    and in which are delineated spaces for parking of vehicles.  The people invited
    to park are not the public as a whole, but the people who have business to
    transact with the stores surrounding the parking space.  Thus the premises
    involved are of a composite nature and in our view in deciding the applicability
    or non-applicability to those premises of the Act, <i>one is not permitted
    to cut up the premises as it were into various parcels and minutely analyse
    the particular uses of the particular parcels</i>.  On the contrary, in our
    view, and realistically the premises must be viewed as a whole and so viewing
    the premises <i>the paramount use</i> thereof will emerge as a parking lot
    with ingress and egress to and fro and with passages within it, but all subordinate
    to <i>the paramount use</i> of parking vehicles.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Mansour</i>,
    the Supreme Court of Canada embarked upon a similar analysis and reached
    a parallel conclusion.  Estey J.A. stated, at p. 921:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I conclude that the term “highway” in its ordinary
    and popular sense and as illustrated by the words employed in s. 1(1)11 of
    the Act does not embrace the concept of a parking lot, and particularly,
    a parking lot adjacent to an apartment building, and presumably one which
    was <i>established primarily for</i> the provision of parking to its inhabitants.  [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is no doubt that “the paramount use” test from <i>Gill v. Elwood</i> and
    the “established primarily for” formulation in <i>Mansour</i> support the
    trial judge’s conclusion that the strip mall parking lot, although used for
    some thru-traffic from
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Wilson Avenue to
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Bathurst Street, was essentially a private parking lot for the customers
    of the stores in the mall.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    appeal, the appellant attempts to overcome the trial judge’s conclusion with
    three submissions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the appellant submits that <i>Gill v. Elwood</i> and <i>Mansour</i> should
    not govern because these cases were decided under a different definition
    of “highway” in the <i>HTA</i>.  Unlike the definition in the <i>HTA</i> in
    force when these cases were decided in the 1970s, the current definition,
    after listing the various locations which can be a highway, including “square” and “place”,
    continues with the new words “any part of which” is intended for or used
    by the general public for the passage of vehicles.  The appellant contends
    that “a part” of the strip mall traffic area is regularly used by some drivers
    as a shortcut from
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Wilson Avenue to
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Bathurst Street; accordingly, this area is “a highway”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not accept this interpretation.  All of the locations that constitute
    a
    “highway” according to the definition found in the <i>HTA</i> are qualified
    by the adjectival phrase “common and public”.  These words govern the analysis,
    whether the location is being considered in its entirety or in part.  In
    the present case, the evidence was clear; although the parking lot was used
    by some drivers as a shortcut, both the intended use and actual use were
    overwhelmingly as a parking area for customers.  Accordingly, the trial judge
    was correct to state near the end of his reasons: “I am not convinced that <i>Gill </i> and <i>Mansour</i> are
    no longer the law of this province by virtue of the amendments to the definition
    of [“highway” in the] <i>Highway Traffic Act</i> in 1983.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s second submission is that the public had acquired prescriptive
    rights to the parking lot in the strip mall, thereby making it a “highway”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    disagree.  The threshold for meeting the criteria for establishing a prescriptive
    right is high: see <i>Henderson et al. v. Volk</i> <i>et al.</i> (1982),
    35 O.R. (2d) 379 (
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) and <i>Ebare v. Winter</i> (2005), 26 R.P.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 220 (On.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  The evidence in this case does not come close to meeting this high threshold.  I
    agree with the trial judge’s analysis and conclusion that the strip mall
    parking lot was the private property of the various store owners.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s third submission is that the trial judge’s decision does not
    strike a proper balance between the “authorized by law” provision in its
    insurance policy and the intent of the legislature to promote public safety
    through the graduated licensing scheme.  As expressed in its factum (para.
    87): “The law should not be interpreted in a way where a driver can drive
    in [on
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Wilson Avenue] and out [the strip mall parking lot] of coverage through the
    course of the same trip.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    disagree.  The legislature has struck the balance explicitly – the graduated
    licensing scheme applies to the operation of a motor vehicle on a “highway”.  Indeed,
    not surprisingly, the entire <i>HTA</i> applies to what its title foreshadows,
    highways.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>E. <u>DISPOSITION</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would dismiss the appeal.  The respondent is entitled to its costs of the
    appeal which I would fix at $20,000 inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>
