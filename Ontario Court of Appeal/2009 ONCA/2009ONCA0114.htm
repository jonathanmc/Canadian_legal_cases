    from very recently, the appellant’s life has been characterized by physical,
    sexual and emotional abuse.  She suffers from serious mental health challenges
    as a result of that abuse.  Against this background, the appellant became
    pregnant in 2007 by her boyfriend, Trevor Schram, with whom she enjoyed a
    healthy relationship.  Mr. Schram welcomed the pregnancy.  The appellant
    and Mr. Schram began living together at his home in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Kirkland
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Lake and, when the school year was completed, the appellant’s two daughters
    from a prior relationship, joined them.  They later moved to a home in Kenogami
    and were living there when the offence in question took place.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    August 2007, the appellant was seriously beaten by three individuals in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Kirkland
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Lake.  She went to a hospital and was told that the baby she was carrying
    was unharmed.  However, some time later, the fetus stopped moving and, a
    week thereafter, was delivered stillborn in the appellant’s home while Mr.
    Schram was away at work.  The appellant feared that her relationship with
    Mr. Schram would not survive the loss of the child, so she did not tell him
    their baby had died.  Instead, she pretended that she was still pregnant
    and that the baby would be delivered by caesarean section at the end of October
    in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">

    the due date approached, the appellant developed a plan in which she would
    depart alone for
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    North Bay ostensibly to have the baby and would return some time thereafter
    with an infant.  In this way, the appellant believed she could preserve her
    relationship with Mr. Schram.  To avoid Mr. Schram attending the hospital
    with her, the appellant started an argument with him shortly before she was
    to leave.  She told Mr. Schram that her sister was unable to look after the
    children so he would have to.  He agreed that she could take his truck to
    the hospital.  To ensure that he did not find someone else to look after
    the girls, she left Mr. Schram a note in which she referred to their earlier
    argument and said that he ought not to contact her, the hospital or the police.  The
    appellant then drove to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Sudbury alone.  </p>

    October 31, 2007, the appellant called Mr. Schram and told him that she had
    given birth to a healthy baby boy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

    <st1:place

    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Sudbury.  She changed into “scrubs”, posing as a health care worker.  After
    entering several rooms looking for a child to take under a medical pretext,
    the appellant went into a room occupied by a newborn baby girl and her mother.  The
    appellant suggested that the mother go into the bathroom to change her dressing.  When
    she did, the appellant took the child and left the hospital.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    the mother came out of the washroom and discovered the baby and the appellant
    were gone, she began looking for them.  At the nursing station, she was told
    the appellant was not a nurse and the hospital went on high alert.  Hospital
    video cameras caught the appellant in the stairwell with the baby.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the hospital parking lot, the appellant changed out of her scrubs and removed
    the child’s identification bracelet.  She drove home to Kenogami and introduced
    the child to her daughters and Mr. Schram.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the meantime, the hospital moved quickly to involve the police.  The

    Sudbury region was locked down and all cars leaving the city were searched.  Approximately
    90 police officers were involved at one point.  An AMBER Alert was issued
    across
    <st1:place

    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario and the story was broadcast nationally with videotaped images of
    the appellant in the hospital.  Police officers, security staff and auxiliary

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    police determined that the appellant had returned to Kenogami.  They went
    to her home and told her they were investigating a child abduction in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Sudbury.  The appellant admitted that she had an infant with her but attempted
    to convince the police that the child was a boy.  The officers asked the
    appellant to remove the baby’s diapers so that they could determine its gender.  She
    refused but the police demanded that she do so.  When she did, it became
    apparent that the infant was a female.  The appellant was arrested and the
    child was returned to her parents.  Some seven hours elapsed from the time
    of the abduction to the time that the baby was recovered.  Thankfully, she
    had suffered no physical harm.</p>

    appellant’s actions had a serious effect on both the victim’s family and
    the community.  There are no words to describe the agony that the victim’s
    parents went through in the hours until their child was returned.  They are
    now unable to trust others to watch their children and have nightmares about
    the abduction.  The victim’s father avoids talking about the offence and
    the family has kept the abduction a secret from their friends and family
    members.  The wider community was also affected.  On the day of the abduction,
    the
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    weeks after the abduction, the appellant pled guilty to abduction of a person
    under fourteen.  She was released on bail pending sentencing.  While on bail,
    she and her daughters moved in with her aunt and uncle, Anne and Mario Batisse.  The
    appellant undertook psychiatric counselling and reintegrated herself in the
    Matachewan community.  She participated in native healing ceremonies and
    made progress through them, the psychiatric care she was receiving, and the
    supportive and therapeutic home environment provided by Anne Batisse, a therapist
    and certified life skills coach.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sentencing judge gave lengthy, thoughtful reasons for sentence.  He considered
    the appellant’s tragic circumstances and, based on the psychiatric evidence,
    found that she was suffering from depression at the time of the offence.  He
    determined that the depression, along with her personality disorder, led
    to her committing the offence.  The sentencing judge also considered the
    progress the appellant had made while on bail and concluded that, if he were
    considering only her best interests, he would have no hesitation in finding
    that the circumstances in which she was then living were the most beneficial
    for her and for her eventual complete rehabilitation.  However, when he considered
    the impact of the offence on the victim and the community, he concluded that
    a significant custodial sentence was warranted in order to meet the sentencing
    goals of denunciation and deterrence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sentencing judge considered four Canadian cases on infant abduction:  <i>R.
    v. Gillen</i>, [1979] B.C.J. No. 575 (C.A.); <i>R. v. Hill</i> (22 March
    1994), Milton M677/94 (Ont. Ct. (Gen. Div.)), aff’d [1995] O.J. No. 1859
    (

    ); and <i>R. v. Jones</i>, [2002] O.J. No. 5148 (Ct. J.).  The sentences
    in these cases range from two and a half years’ imprisonment for an attempt
    to abduct a baby from the hospital [<i>Jones</i>] to a life sentence where
    the infant abduction also involved violence against the mother [<i>Gillen</i>].  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sentencing judge concluded his review of the aggravating and mitigating factors
    with the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Although I am not persuaded that a term of seven
    years is called for given the most unfortunate circumstance of this offender,
    in my view a sentence of five years imprisonment in addition to the time
    already served is adequate to meet the deterrent and denunciatory principles
    of sentencing set out in the Code and the indictment has been endorsed accordingly.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    so doing, he took as his starting point the seven-year sentence that had
    been imposed in <i>Hill </i>and upheld by a majority of this court on appeal.<a

    room of a patient in a maternity ward and asked to take the baby for haemoglobin
    tests.  The mother handed over the baby and the accused left with the child.  The
    child was recovered about 11 hours later after a media and police blitz.  The
    accused had been neglected as a child by her alcoholic parents and been taken
    away by child welfare authorities and placed for adoption.  She had suffered
    turmoil in her marriage and slipped into a transient lifestyle involving

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE OFFENDER  <u></u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant is a 30-year-old Aboriginal woman.  She has no prior criminal record.  She
    survived an unimaginably abusive and cruel childhood in which she was physically,
    emotionally and sexually abused.  Since then, she has had a series of unsuccessful,
    abusive relationships with men. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Prior
    to her birth, the appellant’s natural father abandoned her mother, Jane Batisse.  Jane
    Batisse blamed the appellant for being abandoned.  Jane, who was a member
    of the Matachewan <span
lang=EN-US>First</span> Nation, continuously abused the appellant physically
    and emotionally.  Jane appears to have suffered from an untreated major mental
    illness.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    the appellant was three years old, her family moved in with her stepfather’s
    brother’s family.  Her mother continued to abuse the appellant.  She regularly
    beat her with a board and a wooden spoon.  She extinguished cigarettes on
    the appellant’s back and legs.  On one occasion, she threw the appellant
    down a flight of stairs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    the appellant was 11 years old, her family and her stepfather, Willey Renaud,
    moved to
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Quebec.  The appellant’s mother continued to abuse her physically and emotionally.  When
    the appellant was 14, Willey found Jane holding the appellant’s head in one
    hand and a hammer in her other hand.  He took Jane to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    North Bay
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Psychiatric Hospital, where she was committed.  She did not come home when
    she was released.  The appellant continued to live with Willey Renaud.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Willey’s
    brother, Placide Renaud, started sexually abusing the appellant when she
    was 11 years old and continued to do so until she was 17.  The sexual assaults
    occurred roughly ten times a month.  Eventually, Placide was charged with
    sexually assaulting both the appellant and his own children.  He received
    a ten-year sentence after being found guilty at trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    the appellant was 17, her mother committed suicide.  She left a note instructing
    the appellant to look after her younger sister, Evangeline, who was ten years
    old at the time.  Not long after this, the appellant began a relationship
    with a 23-year-old man named Archie Wabie.  He was an alcoholic and he physically
    abused the appellant when he got drunk.  On at least one occasion, the appellant
    was admitted overnight to a hospital because of injuries he inflicted on
    her.  Wabie was sentenced to jail as a result of one of these beatings.  Wabie
    was also verbally abusive and denigrated the appellant’s Aboriginal heritage.  The
    appellant had two daughters in the course of this relationship, which ended
    in 2002.  After this relationship, the girls continued to live with the appellant.  At
    the time of sentencing, they were five and eight years of age.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    2003, the appellant began a relationship with Denis Presseault.  This relationship
    was also marked by physical and verbal abuse.  In early 2004, the appellant’s
    stepfather, Willey Renaud, was diagnosed with liver cancer.  The appellant
    spent a great deal of time caring for him until he died in July 2005.  During
    this time, her relationship with Presseault deteriorated further.  He denigrated
    the appellant’s close relationship with her stepfather.  He mocked her Aboriginal
    heritage.  He was jealous, controlling and violent.  He did not allow the
    appellant to leave her house and he frequently spent money on prostitutes.  The
    relationship ended in December 2006.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    early 2007, the appellant began dating Trevor Schram.  This was the first
    positive relationship she had with a male other than her stepfather.  Mr.
    Schram accepted and cared for the appellant’s daughters.  In April 2007,
    while pregnant with his child, the appellant and Mr. Schram moved in together.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sometime
    during 2007, the appellant loaned $160.00 to her cousin, Henry Batisse, and
    his wife, Tina Houston, to buy food.  She went to their home in early August
    2007 to be repaid.  Instead, she was attacked by two males and a female.  They
    kicked her in the stomach and back.  She suffered a head wound that required
    stitches.  At the urging of the police, she went to the hospital where it
    appeared that the baby she was carrying was unharmed.  However, some weeks
    later, the fetus stopped moving and shortly thereafter, it was delivered
    stillborn.  Mr. Schram was working out of town when this happened.  The appellant
    did not tell Mr. Schram because she believed he would leave her if he found
    out that she had lost the baby.  She then committed the offence described
    above.   </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sentencing judge found that given the extremely serious nature of the offence,
    which involved an utterly defenceless newborn, violated the safety and security
    of the hospital and had a significant effect on the victim’s family and the
    broader community, a conditional sentence was not available as a term of
    incarceration greater than two years less a day was called for.  I agree
    and for the reasons given by the sentencing judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, however, the sentencing judge erred in using the sentence in <i>Hill </i>as
    a baseline from which to determine the appropriate length of the penitentiary
    sentence to impose.  The facts in <i>Hill </i>are materially different from
    those in this case.  In <i>Hill</i>, unlike the present case, the offender
    was not Aboriginal, had not encountered the same systemic factors and did
    not suffer from mental illness.  Moreover, it is significant that <i>Hill </i>was
    decided prior to s. 718.2(e) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> being proclaimed.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a>  As discussed below, s. 718.2(e) is a critical
    consideration in the sentencing of Aboriginal offenders.  Instead, I accept
    the appellant’s submission that after determining that a penitentiary sentence
    was warranted, consistent with the principle of restraint, the sentencing
    judge should have considered the minimum sentence that was adequate in the
    circumstances.     <i> </i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    principle of restraint operates in three ways in the present case.  First,
    it is an important consideration because the appellant was a first offender.  As
    such, the restraint principle requires that the sentencing judge consider
    all sanctions apart from incarceration and where, as here, incarceration
    must be imposed, the term should be as short as possible and tailored to
    the individual circumstances of the accused:  see <i>R. v. Priest</i> (1996),
    30 O.R. (3d) 538 (C.A.), at p. 545.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the principle of restraint requires the sentencing judge to consider rehabilitation
    in determining the appropriate length of the sentence.  In lowering a sentence
    given to a first offender, this court stated in <i>R. v. Blanas</i> (2006),
    207 O.A.C. 226, at para. 5:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[G]eneral deterrence cannot be the sole consideration.  The
    appellant is relatively youthful and has no prior record and appears to have
    the full support of her family and community.  Appropriate consideration
    must be given to the rehabilitation of the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    serious cases and cases involving violence, rehabilitation alone is not the
    determinative factor – general deterrence and denunciation are also significant
    factors to be considered.  However, as this court ruled in <i>R. v. Dubinsky</i>,
    2005 CanLII 5668, at para. 1, it is an error to focus almost exclusively
    on general deterrence and fail to consider individual deterrence and rehabilitation,
    especially when sentencing a first offender.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    Parliament has codified the principle of restraint to limit the use of incarceration
    as a sentencing alternative, particularly for Aboriginal offenders.  Subsection
    718.2(d) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> provides that “an offender should not
    be deprived of liberty, if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate
    in the circumstances”.  Subsection 718.2(e) provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>718.2 A court that imposes a sentence shall also
    take into consideration the following principles:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>                                                …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(e) all available sanctions other than imprisonment
    that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders,
    with particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    principle of restraint enjoys an important role in cases involving Aboriginal
    offenders.  In <i>R. v. Gladue</i>, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688, the Supreme Court
    of Canada directed the courts to consider the systemic and background factors
    which may have played a role in bringing an Aboriginal offender before the
    court (para. 69) and stated that s. 718.2(e) creates a judicial duty to give
    its remedial purpose real force.    See also <i>R. v. Wells</i>, [2000] 1
    S.C.R. 207, where the Supreme Court directs sentencing judges to give effect
    to the principles in s. 718.2(e) and <i>Gladue</i>, even in cases where the
    offence is serious and the sentence involves imprisonment.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sentence imposed by the trial judge was based on his perceived need to give
    predominance to the principles of general deterrence and denunciation and
    without an express consideration of the effect of the sentence on the appellant’s
    rehabilitation.  Had he done so, in my view, he would have concluded that
    a sentence of that length would not promote the appellant’s rehabilitation – in
    fact, it would diminish her prospect of rehabilitation by removing her from
    her community, her children, and her support network as the closest federal
    institution for women is the Grand Valley Institution for Women near Kitchener,
    Ontario, which is 750 kilometres from the Matachewan community where her
    sister and children are located.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore,
    unlike <i>Hill</i> where mental illness was not a factor, here the appellant’s
    mental health problems played a central role in the commission of the offence.  In
    such circumstances, deterrence and punishment assume less importance.  As
    this court emphasized in <i>R. v. Robinson </i>(1974), 19 C.C.C. (2d) 193,
    at p. 197, where offenders commit offences while they are out of touch with
    reality due to mental illness, specific deterrence is meaningless to them.  Further,
    general deterrence is unlikely to be achieved either since people with mental
    illnesses that contribute to the commission of a crime will not usually be
    deterred by the punishment of others.  As well, severe punishment is less
    appropriate in cases of persons with mental illnesses since it would be disproportionate
    to the degree of responsibility of the offender.  In such circumstances,
    the primary concern in sentencing shifts from deterrence to treatment as
    that is the best means of ensuring the protection of the public and that
    the offending conduct is not repeated.  This is especially so where a lengthy
    prison term may be regarded as counterproductive: see also <i>R. v. Hiltermann
    (S.G.) </i>(1993), 141 A.R. 223 (C.A.), and <i>R. v. Peters (D.A.) </i>(2000),
    194 Nfld. &amp; P.E.I.R. 184 (Nfld.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), at paras. 18 – 19. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Without
    in any way minimising the seriousness of the offence and the consequences
    for the victim’s family and the community within which it occurred, in my
    view, a sentence of two and one half years’
    incarceration in addition to pre-sentence custody is adequate to properly
    reflect society’s denunciation and act as a deterrent, while allowing the
    appellant the hope of meaningful rehabilitation.  The appellant was a youthful,
    Aboriginal, first offender with an atrocious childhood and an abusive early
    adulthood.  Her background is filled with physical, sexual and emotional
    abuse at the hands of her mother, uncle and common-law partners.  She has
    serious mental health challenges flowing from that abuse.  There is no question
    that the systemic and personal factors in the appellant’s background led
    to those mental health challenges which in turn led to the offence.  At the
    time the appellant committed the offence, she had recently suffered a miscarriage
    following an unprovoked beating.  The victim was unharmed and returned to
    her parents seven hours after being abducted.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant has been fully remorseful for her actions, from the beginning.  She
    pled guilty three weeks after her arrest which avoided the need for witnesses
    to testify.  She made numerous other expressions of remorse.  She is a single
    parent of two young children with strong family and community support.  After
    her arrest and while on bail, she made unmistakable progress in her rehabilitation.  She
    found a supportive and therapeutic home environment with her aunt.  She received
    mental health care and counselling, and had the opportunity to participate
    in native healing ceremonies with her daughters and other members of the

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Why
    I arrive at this conclusion may be summarized in one word: deference.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sentencing judge, Justice R.D. Gordon, delivered a particularly careful,
    thorough and balanced decision.  He concluded that the appropriate sentence
    in all of the circumstances was a term of imprisonment for five years.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[3]</span></span></span></a>  In arriving at this conclusion, he made no error
    in principle.  He did not fail to take into account any relevant factors
    or place inappropriate emphasis on any relevant factor – including, importantly
    in this case, the <i>Gladue</i> considerations that are mandatory in situations
    involving Aboriginal offenders.  The sentence he imposed is not demonstrably
    unfit.  Absent some such a flaw, his decision is entitled to great deference
    and appellate courts are not permitted to interfere.  See <i>R.. v. M. (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ),</i> [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500; <i>R.  v.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Shropshire,</i> [1995] 4 S.C.R. 227. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    deference is afforded – and warranted – because trial judges are fully attuned
    to the dynamics of the situation in front of them.  We are not.  Sentencing
    judges have seen the offender, the witnesses called on the sentencing hearing
    and, quite likely, the victims. They may well have heard from them all.  We
    have not.  Very significantly, they are close to the communities in which
    they reside.  We are not.  Sentencing judges are therefore best suited, and
    best situated, to assess the impact of the crime on their own community,
    and the broader community, as well as to consider the particular circumstances
    of the offender and of the offence in context.  Whether an appellate judge,
    sitting in the relative isolation of another courtroom and far removed in
    time and place, might have arrived at a somewhat different sentence is not
    the point of sentencing appeals. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    principle was forcefully articulated by Chief Justice Lamer, speaking for
    the entire Court, in <i>R.  v. M.(
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ),</i> at paras. 90-91.  What he said bears reiterating:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Put simply, absent an error in principle, failure
    to consider a relevant factor, or an overemphasis of the appropriate factors,
    a court of appeal <i>should only intervene</i> to vary a sentence imposed
    at trial <i>if</i> the sentence is demonstrably unfit.  Parliament explicitly
    vested sentencing judges with a <i>discretion</i> to determine the appropriate
    degree and kind of punishment under the <i>Criminal Code</i>… </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This deferential standard of review has profound
    functional justifications.  As Iacobucci J. explained in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Shropshire</i>, at para. 46, where the sentencing judge has had the benefit
    of presiding over the trial of the offender, he or she will have had the
    comparative advantage of having seen and heard the witnesses to the crime.  But
    in the absence of a full trial, where the offender has pleaded guilty to
    an offence and the sentencing judge has only enjoyed the benefit of oral
    and written sentencing submissions … the argument in favour of deference
    remains compelling.  A sentencing judge still enjoys a position of advantage
    over an appellate judge in being able to directly assess the sentencing submissions
    of both the Crown and the offender.  <i>A sentencing judge also possesses
    the unique qualifications of experience and judgment from having served on
    the front lines of our criminal justice system.  Perhaps most importantly,
    the sentencing judge will normally preside near or within the community which
    has suffered the consequences of the offender’s crime.  As such, the sentencing
    judge will have a strong sense of the particular blend of sentencing goals
    that will be “just and appropriate” for the protection of that community</i>.  The
    determination of a just and appropriate sentence is a delicate art which
    attempts to balance carefully the societal goals of sentencing against the
    moral blameworthiness of the offender and the circumstances of the offence,
    while at all times taking into account the needs and current conditions of
    and in the community.  The discretion of a sentencing judge should thus not
    be interfered with lightly. [Citation omitted; emphasis added.]</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The Circumstances of this Case,
      and the Principles Applied by the Sentencing Judge</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    any measure, this is an exceedingly sad and tragic case, whether viewed from
    the perspective of the offender, the infant victim and her parents, or the
    community.  It would be difficult to imagine an upbringing and background
    more de-humanizing, brutal, and bereft of hope than that endured by Ms. Batisse.  Her
    heart-rending story is poignantly described in the reasons of both my colleague
    and the trial judge.  I need not repeat it here.  Nothing I say in these
    reasons is intended to minimize or detract from that reality.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the trial judge pointed out, however, there is more to be addressed in the
    sentencing process than simply the needs and circumstances of the offender.  Although
    the provisions of s. 718.2 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> mandate a different
    methodology in the sentencing of Aboriginal offenders, and a different perspective
    towards the balancing of the various factors involved, the fundamental purposes
    of sentencing and its objectives, as set out in the <i>Code</i>, continue
    to apply in such circumstances.  In addition to the goal of rehabilitating
    offenders, the objects of just penal sanctions include the denunciation of
    unlawful conduct, the deterrence of offenders and others from committing
    offences, the need to promote a sense of responsibility in offenders, and
    the need to acknowledge the harm done by the crime to victims and to the
    community: s. 718 (a), (b), (d) and (f).  It is an important principle, as
    well, that a sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of the offence
    and the degree of responsibility of the offender: s. 718.1.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Other
    sentencing principles are of particular relevance to Aboriginal offenders,
    notably those contained in subsections 718.2(d) and (e):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>718.2  A court that imposes a sentence shall also
    take into consideration the following principles:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(d) an offender should not be deprived of liberty,
    if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate in the circumstances; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(e) all available sanctions other than imprisonment
    that are reasonable in the circumstances should be considered for all offenders, <u>with
    particular attention to the circumstances of aboriginal offenders</u>. [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How
    this interplay of sentencing principles will be weighed and applied will
    vary with the case.  It remains the fundamental duty of the trial judge,
    however, to impose a sentence that is fit for the offence and the offender
    in the circumstances.  Indeed, the Supreme Court of Canada has been clear
    that, while s. 718,2(e) “requires a different methodology for assessing a
    fit sentence for an aboriginal offender, it does not mandate, necessarily,
    a different result”: <i>R. v. Wells</i>, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 207, at para. 44.  At
    the same paragraph in <i>Wells</i>, Iacobucci J. continued:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Section 718.2(e) does not alter the fundamental
    duty of the sentencing judge to impose a sentence that is fit for the offence
    and the offender.  Furthermore, in Gladue, as mentioned the Court stressed
    that the application of s. 718.2(e) <i>does not mean that aboriginal offenders
    must always be sentenced in a manner which gives greatest weight to the principles
    of restorative justice and less weight to goals such as deterrence, denunciation,
    and separation.  As a result, it will generally be the case, </i><u>as a
    practical matter</u><i>, that particularly violent and serious offences will
    result in imprisonment for aboriginal offenders as often as for non-aboriginal
    offenders.</i>  Accordingly, I conclude that it was open to the trial judge
    to give primacy to the principles of denunciation and deterrence in this
    case on the basis that the crime involved was a serious one.  [Underlining

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More
    recently, Justice LaForme affirmed this same principle in <i>R. v. Kakekagamick</i> (2006),
    81 O.R. (3d) 664 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Supreme Court made clear in <i>Gladue </i>that the principles of denunciation,
    deterrence and separation are not principles of the criminal justice system
    as distinct from Aboriginal communities. In other words, one cannot assume
    that Aboriginal communities will necessarily reject the application of the
    principles of denunciation, deterrence and separation in the sentencing of
    Aboriginal offenders. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In describing the effect of s.&nbsp;718.2(e) in
    this way, we do not mean to suggest that, as a general practice, aboriginal
    offenders must always be sentenced in a manner which gives greatest weight
    to the principles of restorative justice, and less weight to <i>goals such
    as deterrence, denunciation, and separation.&nbsp; It is unreasonable to
    assume that aboriginal peoples themselves do not believe in the importance
    of these latter goals</i>, and even if they do not, that such goals must
    not predominate in appropriate cases.&nbsp; Clearly there are some serious
    offences and some offenders for which and for whom separation, denunciation,
    and deterrence are fundamentally relevant. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unlike
    in <i>Kakekagamick</i> where the trial judge had not done so, here the sentencing
    judge followed the <i>Gladue</i> and s. 718.2 (e) procedure.  He observed,
    correctly in my view, that the principles of denunciation, deterrence, <u>and</u> rehabilitation
    should be at the forefront of his consideration. He canvassed each of those
    issues fully. He analysed the relevant provisions in the <i>Criminal Code </i>in
    the context of this crime and this Aboriginal offender.  In this regard he
    said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Criminal Code also contains specific provisions
    for consideration when dealing with an aboriginal offender.  In particular,
    Section 718.2 (e) contains a remedial provision directed at ameliorating
    the serious problem of overrepresentation of aboriginal people in our prisons.  This
    provision alters the method of analysis which the court is to use in determining
    a fit sentence for aboriginal offenders and <i>requires the consideration
    of all available sanctions other than imprisonment along with the consideration
    of the particular circumstances of the offender</i>.  When sentencing an
    aboriginal offender, the court must consider information concerning the unique
    systemic or background factors which may have played a part in bringing the
    offender before the court.  In particular the court is to consider whether
    the offender has been affected by such factors as substance abuse in the
    community, poverty, overt racism, and family or community breakdown.  <i>The
    court is also to consider the types of sentencing procedures and sanctions
    which might be appropriate in the circumstances for the offender because
    of her particular aboriginal heritage or connection</i>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sentencing judge applied those directions. He scrupulously considered the
    appellant’s tragic antecedents. He carefully reviewed the circumstances giving
    rise to the abduction plot – including the still birth of her own baby as
    a result of a senseless beating she suffered shortly before the event and
    her deep-seated fear that the loss of her baby would undermine the only stable
    relationship she had ever been able to establish with a man, her current
    spouse.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sentencing judge weighed the testimony of the appellant’s aunt, with whom
    the appellant was then living, about her current progress and mental condition,
    and that of the medical experts who were called to speak to her state of
    mental distress.  He rejected the notion that she was suffering from a major
    depressive disorder prior to the offence, but accepted “unequivocally, that
    she was suffering from some level of depression and that this depression,
    along with her personality disorder, were active ingredients in her decision
    to commit this crime.”  With respect to the appellant’s then current situation
    in her Aboriginal community, and the interests he had to balance, the sentencing
    judge concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Since her release, Ms. Batisse has had the very
    good fortune to have made her home with her aunt Anne Batisse who has provided
    a supportive and therapeutic home environment.  Between the support and counselling
    she has received there, and the psychiatric care being provided by Doctor
    Gagnon, she has made slow but steady progress in dealing, not just with her
    actions in the context of the offence, but in dealing with her entire past.  She
    has also had the opportunity to participate in native healing ceremonies
    with her daughters and other members of the community and these have been
    of significant benefit to her.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>Without a doubt, if I was to be considering
      only what is in the best interest of Brenda Batisse, I would have no hesitation
      in finding that her current circumstances are most beneficial to her and
      to her eventual complete rehabilitation</i>.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is, of course, necessary also to consider the
    impact of a crime such as this on the victim and the community when considering
    what is just and appropriate as a sentence. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    thoughtfully describing what he saw as the impact of the crime on the community,
    the infant and the infant’s family, the sentencing judge summarized the mitigating
    and aggravating factors in the case.  He concluded there were significant
    mitigating factors, including (i) the short period of time the child was
    missing and the fact that the child was well treated and returned unharmed;
    (ii) the appellant’s plea of guilty and genuine remorse; (iii) the appellant’s “singularly
    difficult upbringing resulting in significant emotional difficulties which
    were affecting her judgment when this offence was committed”; (iv) the loss
    of the appellant’s own child just prior to the crime; (v) her lack of a criminal
    record; and (vi) the fact that everyone agreed her risk of re-offending was
    minimal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    aggravating factors, the sentencing judge took into account (i) that the
    crime had not been committed on the spur of the moment and was one that “required
    significant  aforethought and planning”; (ii) that it was committed against
    society’s most vulnerable victim, an infant not yet five hours old; (iii)
    that it had a significant impact on the community, resulting in substantial
    costs being incurred and a virtual lock down of the city of Sudbury for a
    period of time; and (iv) that it had major and long-lasting effects on the
    parents.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    this review, the sentencing judge proceeded to consider the positions of
    the Crown and the defence as to the sentence to be imposed, including the
    case law presented to him.  The Crown sought a lengthy penitentiary sentence
    of seven years.  The defence asked for a conditional jail sentence.</p>

    must be taken to have fulfilled his obligation under s. 718.2 (d) and (e)
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i> to consider the availability and appropriateness
    of less restrictive sanctions than imprisonment, that is, to give effect

    not suitable in the circumstances.  He made this decision acknowledging that
    if the appellant’s rehabilitation and best interests were the only factors
    to be weighed he would leave her in her pre-sentencing situation in her native
    community.  On balance, however, the sentencing judge concluded that a sentence
    served in the community would not adequately give effect to the principles
    of denunciation and general deterrence that were also in play with respect
    to this very serious crime.  We are all agreed that he did not err in this
    regard. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    issue remaining for the sentencing judge, then, was to determine the appropriate
    length of the period of incarceration.  He said five years.  My colleague
    would say two and one-half years.  This is a determination – absent an error
    in principle, the failure to consider and weigh relevant factors or a demonstrably
    unfit result – that is quintessentially for the sentencing judge.  Appellate
    judges should not strain to find such errors simply because they think a
    penalty is too high or too low.  There were no such errors here.  Indeed,
    the range of sentences disclosed in the jurisprudence presented to the sentencing
    judge in this type of case –
    including decisions from this court – ranged from seven years to life imprisonment. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Addario argued skilfully that, having rejected the fitness of a conditional
    sentence in the circumstances, the sentencing judge was obliged to repeat
    the same analysis he had already done, asking himself again – consistent
    with the principles of restraint – what was the minimum sentence that was
    adequate in the circumstances.  My colleague accepts this argument.  I am
    not sure what it means in this context, however.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    all the appellant is suggesting is that the sentencing judge must still remain
    alert to the minimal sentence principle in determining the ultimate sentence,
    I do not disagree.  A sentencing judge is not required to take a mechanical
    compartmentalized approach to his or her sentencing analysis, however.  At
    the end of the exercise, the judge must arrive at a sentence that is fit
    for the offence and the offender in question, having regard to the circumstances
    in question and the principles of sentencing set out in the <i>Criminal Code</i> and,
    in the case of Aboriginal offenders, the principles enunciated in the <i>Gladue</i> line
    of cases.  Undoubtedly – particularly in cases of first offenders – this
    analysis entails a consideration of what is the minimum sentence that is
    adequate in the circumstances: see, for example, <i>R.  v. Priest</i> (1996),
    30 O.R. (3d) 538 (C.A.), at pp. 544-545.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But
    in conducting the conditional sentencing analysis properly – as he admittedly
    did here – and rejecting that option, the sentencing judge gave effect to
    those principles.  His reasons, read fairly and as a whole, make it abundantly
    clear that he did not suddenly forget those principles when he went on to
    the next stage of the analysis.  Indeed, at the end of the day his decision
    was that a sentence of five years’ imprisonment was “adequate” – that is,
    not too much and not too little –
    to meet the needs of denunciation and deterrence, having earlier determined
    that rehabilitation alone could not override these other considerations in
    the circumstances.</p>

    accepting the appellant’s submission that the sentencing judge gave up the
    search for an appropriate <i>minimal</i> sentence in his post-conditional
    sentence analysis, my colleague fastens on the use she concludes he made
    of the seven-year sentence imposed by Justice LeSage (as he then was), and

    for the low end of sentences in cases of this nature and worked backwards
    from that point, in effect “discounting” that minimum for the appellant’s
    emotional difficulties, Aboriginal background and other mitigating factors.  Instead,
    in her analysis, having concluded that a penitentiary term was warranted,
    the sentencing judge should have searched again for the minimum sentence
    that was adequate in the circumstances, consistent with the principle of

    he adopted the <i>Hill</i> sentence as some sort of benchmark and worked
    backward from there to arrive at what he found to be the appropriate disposition.  The
    sentencing judge addressed the jurisprudence specifically in the course of
    reflecting on the second prerequisite for a conditional sentence, namely
    whether a sentence of less than two years’ imprisonment was warranted.  He
    did so to determine “if the range of appropriate sentence might include a
    period of incarceration of less than two years.”  He decided it would not.  This
    was a perfectly proper approach.  Having thus confirmed that the jurisprudence
    suggests some sort of range for the offence in question, a sentencing judge
    does not err in ultimately crafting an appropriate sentence in the circumstances
    with one eye on that range.  That is what ranges are for.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,
    the sentencing judge considered at length the Canadian precedents presented
    to him involving infant abductions, including <i>Hill</i>.  While similar
    in type to the present case, they all may be distinguished in some ways.  The
    sentencing judge was aware of this.  But, significantly, they <i>all</i> involved
    sentences of incarceration longer than that imposed by the sentencing judge
    here – varying from life imprisonment in <i>R v. Gillen</i><a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[7]</span></span></span></a> a sentence of two and one-half years’ imprisonment
    was imposed for an <i>attempted</i> abduction where the child was neither
    touched nor taken.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    foundation for my colleague’s analysis in this regard appears to be the sentencing
    judge’s remarks to this effect:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Although I am not persuaded that a term of seven
    years is called for given the most unfortunate circumstance of this offender,
    in my view a sentence of five years imprisonment in addition to the time
    already served is adequate to meet the deterrent and denunciatory principles
    of sentencing set out in the Code …</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the sentence imposed in <i>Hill</i> was seven years’ imprisonment, this comment
    did not refer particularly to <i>Hill</i> at all, in my view.  It is a response
    to the Crown’s submission requesting “a lengthy penitentiary sentence of
    seven years.”  It may be that my colleague is influenced by the fact that
    the sentencing judge quoted from a portion of the judgment of Justice LeSage
    dealing with the nature of this sort of crime but ending with the comment
    that he “believe[d] that seven years is at the lower if not the lowest end
    of an appropriate range of sentence for this crime.”  However, I see nothing
    in the reasons of the sentencing judge to suggest that he viewed Justice
    LeSage as having laid down some sort of minimum benchmark or baseline.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sentencing judge’s comment was made immediately after a lengthy analysis
    of the jurisprudence presented to him in the context of the defence request
    for a conditional sentence.  Having rejected that argument, he in turn rejected
    the argument put forward by the Crown for a seven year sentence.  In my view,
    he did not treat the reference to seven years being “at the lower if not
    the lowest end of an appropriate range”
    as establishing some sort of baseline. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the sentencing judge was fully alert to the purposes and principles of sentencing
    as enunciated in sections 718 through 718.2 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>,
    including the requirement that all available sanctions other than imprisonment
    must be considered and including the need “to consider the types of sentencing
    procedures <i>and sanctions</i> <i>which might be appropriate</i> in the
    circumstances for the offender because of her particularly aboriginal heritage
    or connection” (emphasis added).  Because he addressed these matters earlier
    in his reasons does not mean he forgot them at the end. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since
    I am satisfied the sentencing judge was completely alive to all of the principles
    of sentencing set out in the <i>Criminal Code</i> as well as to the additional
    requirements to be addressed in the context of an Aboriginal offender, I
    am not able to conclude, as my colleague has, that he failed to give effect
    to the principle of restraint – whether from a misreading of <i>Hill</i> or
    otherwise. I therefore cannot conclude that this court should embark upon
    a <u>re-application</u> of the those factors leading to a sentence that might
    be more in keeping with what some of us might have imposed had we been the
    sentencing judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    principle of restraint operates in three ways in the present case, my colleague
    suggests: (i) it is an important consideration because the appellant is a
    first offender; (ii) it requires the sentencing judge to consider rehabilitation
    in determining the appropriate length of sentence; and (iii) the principle
    of restraint enjoys an important role in cases involving Aboriginal offenders,
    among other things, because Parliament has codified the principle to limit
    the use of incarceration.  I do not disagree.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the sentencing judge gave effect to all of these considerations, in my view.  He
    was well aware that the appellant was a first offender, mentioning it at
    least twice and including it in his list of mitigating factors.  He plainly
    took this factor into account.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor
    did he ignore in any way, or fail to weigh, the appellant’s prospects of
    rehabilitation.  I have earlier cited a passage from the sentencing judge’s
    reasons where he noted that, had he only to consider the best interests of
    the appellant, leaving her with her aunt in her native community would be “most
    beneficial to her and to her eventual complete rehabilitation.”  Earlier
    he had acknowledged the importance of rehabilitation to society in the long
    term because of the eventual need –
    whatever the length of sentence – to re-establish and re-integrate the offender
    into the community.  Significantly, however, in the two paragraphs immediately
    preceding the very passage cited by my colleague, the sentencing judge said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In the case before me, I am aware of and have considered
    the various mitigating factors earlier referred to.  <u>I am aware of Ms.
    Batisse’s aboriginal heritage, and I have considered fully her upbringing
    and the various tragedies that have befallen her</u>.  I have considered
    the racial discrimination that she suffered as a student and <u>I have considered
    that a sanction which incorporates native healing traditions would be of
    significant benefit to her.</u>  <i><u>Although these factors will impact
    on the ultimate sentence I impose</u></i>, their combined effect is not sufficient
    to leave a sentence of two years less a day as a viable or possible sentencing
    alternative.  Even had I found otherwise, it is my view that serving the
    sentence in the community would not be consistent with the fundamental purpose
    and principles of sentencing set out in Section 718 to 718.2 of the Code.  In
    particular, a conditional jail sentence would not, in the circumstances of
    this case, satisfy the denunciatory or general deterrence goals of sentencing. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Notwithstanding the sadness I feel for Ms. Batisse
    … the enormity of this crime calls out for a significant custodial sentence. …
    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    principle of restraint to limit the use of incarceration as a sentencing
    alternative, particularly for Aboriginal offenders, is now well-embedded
    in Canadian law: <i>Criminal Code</i>, subsections 718(d) and (e); <i>Gladue</i>;
    and<i> Wells</i>. The trial judge was attentive to this prerequisite and
    applied it, even if he did not call it specifically by that name.  He satisfied
    himself that permitting the appellant to serve her sentence in the community
    was inconsistent in the circumstances with the fundamental purpose and principles
    of sentencing as set out in the <i>Code</i>.  For the same reasons he held
    that a period of incarceration of less than two years was unsuitable.  Having
    balanced all of the factors, including the appellant’s best interests and
    prospects of rehabilitation, her Aboriginal background and the need for denunciation
    and deterrence, he concluded that the seven year sentence sought by the Crown
    was too long but that a sentence of five years was appropriate.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my own view, the sentence he imposed is fit in the circumstances.  As I have
    argued, however, that is not the point.  The sentence is not demonstrably
    unfit and I see no error in the sentencing judge’s view that the principles
    of denunciation and general deterrence should outweigh principles of rehabilitation
    in the circumstances of this case. Nothing is to be gained by comparing this
    offence to other serious crimes that harm society and debating which is worse
    and what punishments are warranted by which.  By any standard, the appellant
    committed a monstrous, egregious crime.  In that regard, the following observations
    of LeSage J. in <i>Hill</i> – a somewhat parallel case – have resonance:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>She has committed a most heinous crime.  <i>She
      is not an evil person but she has committed an evil crime</i>.  The crime
      of kidnapping, especially the kidnapping of a young child, is one that
      we, as citizens, have no reasonable way of protecting ourselves from.  Kidnapping
      by a stranger in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    is, thank God, not a common crime but <i>it is so shockingly evil that when
    it occurs a denunciatory or an exemplary sentence must be imposed</i>.  Society
    simply cannot react to this crime except with a sentence that will deter
    other persons who might consider doing the same…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>Notwithstanding all of the mitigating factors,
      I cannot disregard the enormity of this crime</i>.  Not only the effect
      that it has had on the …
    family, but the effect that such a crime has had on this community, this
    province, this country.  That is what criminal laws are designed to protect
    against.  A sentence to be imposed must be denunciatory of such conduct.  [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Those
    comments apply with equal force to the present case.  In arriving at his
    conclusion, the sentencing judge carefully considered all of the relevant
    principles of sentencing and applied them – correctly, in my view – to the
    difficult and poignant circumstances he faced.  We are all in agreement that
    he made no error in concluding that a significant period of incarceration
    was warranted.  We disagree over the term of that incarceration he chose.  But
    the sentencing judge, after weighing all of the relevant principles and factors
    and after having considered the rehabilitative needs of the appellant, decided
    that a sentence of five years imprisonment was “adequate” to meet the principles
    of denunciation and deterrence that he viewed as outweighing rehabilitation
    in the circumstances.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In

    principle of restraint provided not only that an offender should not be deprived
    of liberty if less restrictive sanctions may be appropriate, but also the
    principle that even if imprisonment need be imposed, it ought to be the lightest
