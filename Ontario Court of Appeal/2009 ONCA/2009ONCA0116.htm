    sexual assaults and seven involved other assaults.  The victims of the assaults
    were the appellants daughter and three of his stepdaughters.  The offences
    were historical in nature and were alleged to have occurred over a fifteen-year
    period.  The appellant was tried by a judge alone and convicted on all counts.  He
    received a total sentence of 3 years imprisonment.  The appellant appeals

    do not accept this interpretation of the trial judges reasons.  It was open
    to the trial judge to find, based on the appellants admissions as to when
    (1980-81) and where the events underlying this allegation of gross indecency
    occurred, that Rachel was between the ages of eleven and thirteen when the
    event occurred.  The appellants evidence on cross-examination that his present
    recollection was that Rachel was younger than that when the event occurred
    does not detract from the appellants own evidence as to when the event occurred
    and Rachels actual age (eleven to thirteen) at that time.</p>

    her reasons when she said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'> The reality
    is that her evidence (Mary Lyn) was largely confirmed by the evidence of

    appellant submits that the other witnesses, in fact, did not confirm Mary
    Lyns evidence on its central features and that one of the stepsisters (Elizabeth)
    contradicted significant parts of Mary Lyns evidence.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge reviewed the evidence in relation to these counts in some detail
    between paras. 173 and 179.  This review included the evidence of the stepsister,
    Rachel, which did confirm the evidence of Mary Lyn.  The trial judge also
    reviewed the evidence of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Elizabeth.  We are not satisfied that any part of that review was inaccurate.  While
    <st1:City

    Elizabeths evidence certainly did not confirm Mary Lyns evidence to the
    same extent as did the evidence of Rachel, there were aspects of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Elizabeths evidence that were potentially supportive of Mary Lyns evidence.  We
    see no error in the trial judges review of the evidence or in her reference
    to the existence of confirmatory evidence from the other sisters.</p>

    1 alleged an ongoing sexual assault against the appellants own daughter,
    Jessica.  Although all of the charges were serious, this charge was probably
    the most serious.  The trial judge reviewed the evidence in relation to this
    count in detail.  She was aware of the specific difficulty inherent in assessing
    the reliability of Jessicas evidence.  Jessica testified that she recalled
    the events that were relevant to the sexual assault charges some time shortly
    after she left the appellants home when she was seventeen years of age.  She
    recalled that these events occurred when she was between the ages of seven
    and thirteen.  Jessica also testified that her memory became more detailed
    after she sought counselling for herself.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    para. 216 of her reasons, the trial judge specifically indicates that an additional
    layer of scrutiny was needed in respect of Jessicas evidence because of
    the manner in which she purported to recall the details of the relevant events.  There
    is no reason to think that the trial judge did not do exactly what she said
    she had to do and examine that evidence with additional scrutiny.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the end, the trial judge believed the evidence of Jessica and accepted that
    her recollection was reliable.  We see no misapprehension in the relevant
    evidence affecting that determination.  The trial judge was entitled, as
    a matter of law, to accept the evidence of Jessica even though special scrutiny
    was required given the way in which she came to recall the relevant events.  </p>

    addition to the attack on specific convictions, counsel for the appellant
    argues that the trial judge shifted the burden of proof and placed that burden
    on the appellant on all counts.  Counsel also submits that the trial judge
    applied a different standard when testing the credibility and reliability
    of the appellants evidence than she did when testing the reliability and
    credibility of the evidence of the complainants.  </p>

    submission is a very familiar one to this court and requires a review of
    the entirety of the reasons of the trial judge.  We have examined those lengthy
    and detailed reasons.  In our view, there is no support for the submission
    that the reasons placed a burden of proof on the appellant or subjected the
    appellants evidence to a higher level of scrutiny.  The trial judges reasons
    for rejecting the appellants various explanations and denials were fully
    supported in the evidence and were, in our view, reasonable.  The trial judge
    also expressly referred to <i>W.D.</i> and applied the formula set out in <i>W.D.</i> in
    assessing whether the Crown had met its burden of proof.  </p>

    trial judge imposed a total sentence of 3 years imprisonment.  This sentence
    was in the low end of the appropriate range given the seriousness of these
    crimes, the blatant breach of trust and the number of victims involved in
    this matter.  In imposing a sentence near the bottom end of the range, the
    trial judge took into account the appellants many and significant medical
    problems.  She also expressed the belief that the prison authorities could
    adequately address those medical problems.  </p>

    main thrust of the argument before us on the sentence appeal is that the
    evidence establishes that the prison authorities are not able to meet the
    appellants medical needs.  Counsel submits that it would be appropriate
    to reduce the sentence to 2 years less a day so that a conditional sentence
    could be imposed.  The appellant submits that a conditional sentence involving
    virtual house arrest except for medical reasons would meet the needs of deterrence
    and denunciation.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    cannot agree.  In our view, a sentence of 2 years less a day is simply too
    little to adequately reflect the seriousness of these offences.  In addition,
    the evidence placed before us to the effect that the correctional authorities
    have not met the appellants medical needs is not persuasive.  We are not
    satisfied that the evidence demonstrates that those needs have not been met
    and will not be met.  No doubt, it would be better for the appellants medical
    treatment if he were not incarcerated.  That is, however, no justification
    for interfering with an entirely appropriate sentence that takes into account
    the added difficulties the appellant will face in custody.  </p>
