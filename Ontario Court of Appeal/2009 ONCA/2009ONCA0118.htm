    Ontario. On the afternoon of June 25, 2001, he and Boris Zak, a jewellery
    wholesaler, met by pre-arrangement at the store so that Mr. Zak could show
    him jewellery that Mr. Sivapragasam might wish to take on consignment and
    sell.</p>

    Zak parked his car in an alleyway at the rear of the store and entered with
    a duffel bag containing roughly $150,000 worth of gold jewellery. The appellant
    Sivapragasam inspected it and selected jewellery worth approximately $11,000.
    When they finished their transaction, Mr. Zak and the appellant left by the
    back entrance with the duffel bag containing the rest of the jewellery. Together
    they carried it towards Mr. Zak’s car.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    they entered the alleyway, Mr. Zak noticed a man sitting on top of a wall
    near his car and apparently communicating with another person around the
    corner of the wall. He hurriedly put the duffel bag in the trunk of his car
    as the two men rushed towards him. Mr. Sivapragasam swore and ran away. One
    of the men brandished a gun and fired a shot into the trunk of Mr. Zak’s
    vehicle. The gun was put to Mr. Zak’s head and the two men demanded his car
    keys. Mr. Zak threw the keys at them and fled. When he returned several minutes
    later, his trunk was open and the duffel bag was gone.</p>

    with the getaway driver and the two robbers. The van was owned by the father
    of Kevin George who had asked if he could borrow it that afternoon. Kevin
    George was arrested when he arrived home with the van at about 10:20 p.m.
    that night. The appellant Nadarajah, who was best friends with Kevin George,
    was arrested eight months later, on February 21, 2002.</p>

    of his car. The real question was whether either of the appellants was involved. </p>

      Superior Court of Justice was scheduled to begin on November 8, 2004. He
      says that in the circumstances of this case, this delay of 33.3 months
      constitutes a violation of the right guaranteed to him by s. 11(b) of the <i>Charter
      of Rights and Freedoms</i> to be tried within a reasonable time. He argues
      that the application judge erred in dismissing his application to stay

      it is not a mathematical exercise. Rather, the following factors must be
      considered and balanced in determining whether the appellant was tried
      within a reasonable time:</span></p>

      approximately 23.3 months was in the Ontario Court of Justice and 10 months
      was in the Superior Court of Justice. None of the delay was waived by the
      appellant.</span></p>

      that only 12.6 months of the time in the Ontario Court should be found
      due to delay for which either the Crown or inadequate institutional resources
      were responsible, and that the remainder was part of the inherent time
      requirements of the case. Similarly, he accepted the Crown’s submission
      that 6.4 months of the time in the Superior Court was properly considered
      as either Crown or institutional delay, with the remainder being neutral.
      In addition, he was not satisfied that the appellant had been prejudiced
      by any alleged delay, and he therefore dismissed the application.</span></p>

      appellant acknowledges that the time from his arrest on February 21, 2002
      to March 14, 2002, during which he retained counsel, had a bail hearing
      resulting in his release, and requested disclosure, is properly considered
      part of the normal intake period. However, he says that the next three
      and one-half months, to June 27, 2002, when disclosure was provided, is
      not properly attributable to intake requirements. He says that it is the
      responsibility of the Crown, because the essential evidence was all gathered
      before his arrest, and could have and should have been disclosed promptly
      upon request. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
      do not agree. The Crown’s case had some complexity. It was based largely
      on circumstantial evidence, including fingerprint analysis, gunshot residue
      testing, DNA analysis and several hundred pages of cell phone records,
      as well as statements from eyewitnesses. While all this was in the possession
      of the police before the appellant’s arrest, organizing and analyzing the
      information has to be allowed for, particularly the reviewing of the telephone
      records to identify links that might exist. Moreover, there were four accused
      to whom disclosure had to be made. I agree with the application judge that
      in this case, the time from arrest to June 27, 2002 is not an unreasonable
      intake period.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant then contests the time from July 30, 2002, when a judicial pre-trial
      was requested, to September 6, 2002,  when it began, arguing that this
      is institutional delay and should not be considered as neutral, as the
      application judge appears to implicitly have found. The simple answer to
      this submission is that on July 30, 2002, counsel for the appellant was
      content to have the pre-trial set for September 6, 2002, because of defence
      counsels’ schedules and because disclosure had just been received on the
      previous appearance. This time would reasonably have been required to prepare
      for the pre-trial period. It is therefore properly considered as inherent. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      third time period contested by the appellant concerns the six months from
      the eighth day of the preliminary hearing, July 16, 2003, when it was adjourned
      because of new disclosure made by the Crown, to January 12, 2004, when
      the appellant was committed for trial. The appellant argues that this entire
      six months is properly attributable to the Crown because it was due to
      the belated disclosure. In the alternative, the appellant says that this
      should be considered institutional delay, because this full six months
      was required to arrange just two more court days, which was all that was
      needed to complete the preliminary hearing and receive the ruling. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
      July 16, 2003, the Crown produced a new witness who offered incriminating
      evidence against a co-accused. Not surprisingly, the co-accused sought
      and was granted an adjournment to August 15, 2003. The case was unable
      to proceed on that day because of the devastating blackout that occurred
      in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario the day before. The matter was put over to September 3, and ultimately
    to September 22, to set a date for completion of the preliminary hearing.
    On September 22, the court was advised that while the appellant’s counsel
    was available all of October and all of November, save for two days, the
    first date available for all counsel was November 17. Since the court was
    not available on that date, the case was put over to November 25, 2003 when
    the evidence was completed. Argument took place on December 9 and reasons
    for committal were released on January 12, 2004.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
      the application, the Crown accepted that the 64 days from September 22
      to November 25 should be considered either Crown or institutional delay.
      The application judge found that the period from July 16 to August 15 was
      occasioned by the Crown producing a surprise witness not previously disclosed
      to the defence. But he found that the period thereafter was properly characterized
      as inherent time dictated by the availability of counsel and the judge “…except
      perhaps October 1 to November 25” presumably because of the availability
      of appellant’s counsel. In the end, however, the application judge accepted
      the Crown’s assessment of delay in the Ontario Court including, by inference,
      some 64 days of the six months to be assigned to either the Crown or institutional
      delay.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      see no error in this allocation. I agree that the 30 days from July 16
      to August 15 required by late Crown disclosure is the responsibility of
      the Crown. I do not agree that, because of this, the Crown must accept
      responsibility for the entire six months thereafter. All parties and the
      court were ready to proceed on August 15, but were prevented from doing
      so by the blackout, an event completely extraneous to the justice system
      that necessitated further rescheduling and therefore further delay. In
      my view, that delay was caused by the blackout, not the Crown’s late disclosure
      a month earlier. This extraneous event, which obviously took everyone by
      surprise, cannot be said to be the Crown’s responsibility, and distinguishes
      this case from <i>R. v. N.N.M. </i>(2006), 209 C.C.C. (3d) 436 (Ont. C.A.).</span></p>

      I think it is appropriate to attribute some of the further delay occasioned
      by the blackout to Crown or institutional factors. The appellant’s counsel
      was available all of October and all of November except two days. While
      I recognize that other counsel had scheduling problems there appears to
      have been no effort by the Crown to find “fast track” dates before November
      25, despite the obvious problem of the passing of time. Balancing the Crown’s
      shortcoming with the timing complications presented by other counsel, allocating
      some 30 days of the time from October 1, to November 25 is fair. From then
      to January 12, 2004 the time was taken up with the completion of evidence,
      argument, and the reserving of the committal decision, and is properly
      categorized as neutral. Thus, for the period from July 16, 2003 to January
      12, 2004, I agree with the number used by the application judge of approximately
      64 days as being properly categorized as Crown or institutional delay.</span></p>

      fourth period raised by the appellant is from the first appearance in the
      Superior Court on January 24, 2004 to March 24, 2004, when the pre-trial
      was scheduled to begin. He argues that these two months should be attributed
      to the Crown because it supported several adjournment requests by a co-accused,
      made in a dubious attempt to get legal aid in order to retain counsel.
      The application judge did not deal expressly with this time frame but implicitly
      found it to be neutral. I agree. This was a case of multiple accused. It
      was appropriate that they be tried together. Some inherent delay attributable
      to this is to be expected.</span></p>

      the appellant argues that 38 days from March 22 to April 29, 2004 required
      to obtain a pre-trial in the Superior Court, once it was requested, must
      be considered institutional delay. I do not agree. In this case, the appellant
      was in custody on other charges on March 22 and his attendance at the pretrial
      had to be arranged. The delay was not excessive, particularly given multiple
      accused. This time is properly characterized as neutral.</span></p>

      While the appellant tendered no evidence of prejudice to his defence, his
      affidavit recited anxiety and stress, and adverse effects on his education
      and his ability to attend family events due to the delay. While this constituted
      some prejudice, it could not be said to be more than modest. For five months
      of the delay, the appellant was incarcerated on other charges. Up until
      that happened, the terms of his release permitted him to continue his education
      and participate in family events to some degree, albeit with some inconvenience

      on appeal. I do not share that view. This court has made clear, most recently
      in <i>R. v. Cranston et al. </i>(2008), O.N.C.A., at para. 35, that a stay
      imposed for a violation of s. 11(b) of the <i>Charter </i>is to be reviewed
      on a standard of correctness. While there is no doubt that the court’s
      ultimate task in such an application involves a careful assessment and
      balancing of the relevant considerations, that is done for the purpose
      of determining whether, in all the circumstances of the particular case,
      the delay has crossed the line from reasonable to unreasonable contrary
      to the right guaranteed by the <i>Charter</i>. In my opinion, that is a

      conclude that, in all the circumstance of this case, the application judge
      was correct in his ultimate assessment. The delay was not unreasonable.
      This was not the simplest of cases. It necessarily involved multiple accused.
      The charges were serious. The delay in the Ontario Court is only modestly
      in excess of the guidelines set for institutional delay by the Supreme
      Court of Canada. In the Superior Court that guideline was not exceeded
      at all. And the appellant could be said to suffer only limited personal
      prejudice. In my opinion, the appellant’s s. 11(b) rights were not violated.
      This ground of appeal must be dismissed.</span></p>

      appellant Sivapragasam brought a motion for a directed verdict which was
      dismissed by the trial judge. He now appeals, arguing that his conviction
      on both counts was unreasonable. In particular, he says that there is a
      complete lack of evidence to support the inference that he was part of
      an agreement to rob Mr. Zak or that he was a party to the robbery. The
      question, then, is whether the verdict against this appellant on these
      charges is one that a properly instructed jury acting judicially could
      reasonably have rendered.</span></p>

      my opinion the question must be answered in the affirmative. The evidence
      is clear that Mr. Zak was robbed. Indeed that was agreed at trial. It is
      equally clear that it was a planned and carefully executed robbery. The
      gunman and his associate knew exactly where to be, when to be there, and
      what to take. The only issue is whether the circumstantial evidence was
      such that a reasonable jury, acting judicially, could be satisfied that
      the appellant’s participation was the only reasonable conclusion available. </span></p>

      re-arranged it. Only the appellant and Mr. Zak knew what the green duffel
      bag contained when the appellant helped to carry it to Mr. Zak’s car. Following
      the robbery, Mr. Zak understood from what the appellant said that he had
      called the police. He had not. Taken together, this evidence would allow
      a reasonable jury acting judicially to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt
      that the appellant was part of the conspiracy to rob Mr. Zak and was a

      existed, based on all of the evidence. Secondly, they must decide on a
      balance of probabilities whether each accused was a member of that conspiracy,
      based only on the evidence directly admissible against that accused, such
      as his own acts, or omissions directly admissible against him. If the answer

      evidence directly admissible against the particular accused must be disentangled

      this case, the conspiracy issue was not without difficulty, in particular,
      whether the evidence sufficiently demonstrated that either appellant was
      a member of the conspiracy. Although they were tried together as co-conspirators,
      they were not alleged to have ever met, spoken to, or known each other
      during the life of the conspiracy. The evidence was entirely circumstantial.
      In respect of the appellant Nadarajah, it was of four kinds: eyewitness
      evidence (which did not identify him), fingerprints, DNA analysis and cellular
      telephone records. Mr. Nadarajah gave evidence offering an innocent explanation
      of the fingerprints, the DNA and the phone records. In respect of the appellant
      Sivapragasam, who did not give evidence, the evidence of his participation
      consisted of the evidence of Mr. Zak and cellular telephone records.</span></p>

      to the jury relating the relevant evidence to the positions taken by each

      deficiencies in the charge concerning robbery were twofold.  First, as
      to the law, it resulted in confusion. The evidence clearly suggested that
      the Crown’s case was that the appellant Nadarajah was one of the two principals
      in the alleyway who actually robbed Mr. Zak and the appellant Sivapragasam
      as the inside man aided or abetted the robbery and hence was a party to

      to the offence by actually committing it or by aiding or abetting another
      to do so. Both routes to conviction were left to the jury for both appellants.</span></p>

      21(2) of the <i>Code</i> to finding a person to be a party to the offence
      of robbery. The trial judge appears to have understood this to be part
      of the Crown’s theory. His understanding was not without foundation, given
      the submission of Crown counsel, even though there was no view of the evidence

      judge concerning armed robbery. This resulted in a recharge reiterating
      the common purpose route to participation in the robbery. Defence counsel
      then began to question whether this was appropriate, given the evidence.
      When the Crown raised similar doubts, the trial judge recalled the jury
      and told them that common purpose probably did not apply, but rather the
      Crown’s case was that the appellants had each participated directly in
      committing the robbery. No mention was made at this stage of aiding or

      the jury any understanding of the evidence relevant to the issues to be
      decided on the robbery charge for each appellant. This mattered because
      their positions were quite different. There was little if any evidence
      that could permit the conclusion that Mr. Sivapragasam directly committed
      the robbery, or that Mr. Nadarajah aided or abetted others to do so. Nor
      did the charge attempt to refer the jury to the principal evidence relevant
