'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the summer of 2003, the appellant was a 24 year-old university student. He
    was living with his family and had no criminal record. On the evening of
    August 14, 2003, the first night of an electrical blackout that affected
    much of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario, the appellant and two friends, Mr. Hasan and Mr. Chaudhry, were
    looking at the sky through a telescope across the street from Mr. Chaudhry’s
    home. None of the group was consuming alcohol.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Around
    midnight, Mr. Garavellos passed the group of stargazers in a car driven by
    his friend, Mr. Medeiros. Mr. Garavellos and Mr. Medeiros had been smoking
    marijuana and drinking alcohol during the evening. As they drove by, Mr.
    Garavellos called the three friends “fucking geeks”. Angered by this insult,
    the appellant ran after the car and hit it with his hand. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Medeiros and Mr. Garavellos got out of their car and were angry and loud,
    demanding to know who had hit the car. Mr. Garavellos had a glass beer bottle
    in his hand. A confrontation ensued. Mr. Garavellos and Mr. Medeiros remained
    hostile, moving the appellant and his friends back along the street. Mr.
    Garavellos, in particular, was loud and aggressive. The appellant ran back
    to his knapsack and retrieved a knife he had purchased for protection following
    an attempted robbery. Mr. Hasan also armed himself with a tool from the jack
    set in his car. Mr. Medeiros returned to his car, apparently to arm himself,
    saying, “Wait ‘til you see what I have in my trunk.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According
    to Mr. Hasan and Mr. Chaudhry, Mr. Garavellos then pushed at Mr. Hasan’s
    head with his free hand, but Mr. Hasan evaded him. Mr. Chaudhry, who had
    martial arts training, stepped in and punched Mr. Garavellos in the side
    of the face, in an effort to stun him and get him to calm down. Mr. Garavellos
    stumbled sideways towards the appellant and attempted to shake himself off.
    He adjusted his grip on the beer bottle and turned towards the appellant.
    He began moving toward the appellant, waving or raising the beer bottle and
    saying, “if you’re gonna do it, do it.” Neither Mr. Hasan nor Mr. Chaudhry
    saw what happened next as their attention was diverted to Mr. Medeiros.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant testified that, upon seeing the two men get out of the car, he
    became frightened. Both were significantly larger than he (the appellant
    was approximately 5’ 6”, 130-135 lbs. at the time; Mr. Medeiros was about
    6’, 200 lbs; and Mr. Garavellos was 5’ 7”, 180 lbs.). According to the appellant,
    Mr. Garavellos advanced towards him, holding a glass beer bottle, and saying, “What
    the fuck?” and, “Who do you think you’re fucking with?” In cross-examination,
    the appellant claimed Mr. Garavellos also said words to the effect, “I’m
    going to fuck you up.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant did not see the exchange between Mr. Garavellos, Mr. Hasan and
    Mr. Chaudhry. He saw Mr. Garavellos approaching, while waving his beer bottle
    and saying words to the effect, “if you’re gonna do it, do it”. The appellant
    said that he perceived Mr. Garavellos’ words and actions as a threat and
    that he was extremely frightened. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According
    to the appellant, Mr. Garavellos continued to advance, raised the beer bottle
    to the side of his head, and then swung at the appellant’s head in an overhand
    baseball-type of throwing motion. The appellant managed to move his head
    out of the way. The appellant testified that when Mr. Garavellos tried to
    hit him over the head, he just reacted and, in a split second, stabbed Mr.
    Garavellos. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    cross-examination, the appellant denied Crown counsel’s suggestions that
    he was angry when he stabbed Mr. Garavellos. For example, he testified as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Q. But he’d yelled at you,
    right?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>A. That’s correct.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Q. Sworn at you, right?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>A. That’s correct.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Q. And in your mind he was
    obnoxious, right?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>A. I’m -- I suppose so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Q. He disrespected you,
    right?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>A. That’s correct.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Q. And all of that made
    you angry?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>A. It -- I was angry when
    the initial comment was made, but once he came with the bottle, then I was
    frightened and fearful, that’s why I left the scene.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Q. And all of this made
    you angry enough to point a knife at him and to still go after him even when
    it was a three on one situation, right?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>A. I wouldn’t put it in
    those terms, sir.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Q. And at that point, the
    point just before you stab him, you’re still angry at him because even though
    you’re pointing a knife at him, he still doesn’t respect you, right?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>A. It’s not like that. I
    was -- I was scared because he was swinging the bottle and then I just was
    backing up and then…</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the appellant also maintained his position during cross-examination that
    everything happened quickly, that Mr. Garavellos tried to hit him, and that
    he just reacted. For example, he said:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Q. So you didn’t need to
    follow-up your -- whatever move you made to avoid that beer bottle. You didn’t
    need to follow that up with a stab to Tom Garavellos’ abdomen, did you?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>A. Everything happened so
    quickly, just when -- when he swung it at my head I just defended myself.
    I just reacted because he was already swinging it across his chest and I
    kept backing off, just when he went to strike me on my head, that’s when
    I just reacted. It happened very, very quickly.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s evidence that events happened quickly was confirmed by two 911
    calls made 42 seconds apart, the first made by a witness who heard the words, “Wait
    'til you see what I have in my trunk”, and the second made by a witness who
    saw Mr. Garavellos fall to the ground.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>            ii) The Trial
      Judge’s Initial Ruling</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    a ruling given after the pre-charge conference and before the closing addresses
    of counsel, the trial judge declined to leave the defence of provocation
    with the jury, holding that there was no air of reality to that defence.
    In making this decision, the trial judge appeared to rely on two factors:
    first, the appellant’s evidence disavowing anger as the trigger for his actions,
    and second, a finding that there was no evidence of the appellant acting
    in the heat of passion or as a result of a loss of self control. The trial
    judge said: </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>A close reading of Raman
    Gill’s evidence establishes that he was angry at the comments directed to
    him and his friends and when he struck the car. He expressly disavowed anger
    as the trigger for his subsequent actions including the stabbing of Mr. Garavellos.
    He remained fearful, on his testimony, that Mr. Garavellos would harm him.
    He took the words, “If you’re gonna do it, do it” as a threat not a taunt.
    The defendant had already prepared himself by arming himself with a knife.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=center style='
text-align:center;line-height:normal;
'>…</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='
text-align:left;line-height:normal;
'>On the record here, there is simply no evidence of the defendant acting in
    the heat of passion or a loss of self-control from a wrongful act or insult.
    On the view of the evidence most favourable to the defendant, already described,
    the defence is self-defence for self-preservation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>            iii) The
      Trial Judge’s Second Ruling</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    the Crown’s closing address, in which Crown counsel at trial relied forcefully
    on anger as a motive for murder, defence counsel at trial asked the trial
    judge to re-visit his earlier ruling and to reconsider putting provocation
    to the jury as a defence. The trial judge declined, saying:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>The evidence in my view
    does not support a sudden loss of control. The kind of anger put by Crown
    counsel, even though this is all relatively a short period of time, is one
    really of calculated anger including during the period of the obtaining of
    the knife and it’s my view that there still remains no air of reality to
    the provocation defence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>            iv) Analysis</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    accept the appellant’s submission that the trial judge erred in holding that
    there was no air of reality to the defence of provocation on the facts of
    this case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R.
      v. Cinous</i>, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 3, the Supreme Court of Canada emphasized
      that in determining whether there is an air of reality to a defence, a
      trial judge is engaged in a threshold determination, aimed at assessing
      whether there is evidence based on which a properly instructed jury acting
      reasonably could acquit: <i>Cinous</i> at paras. 54-60; see also <i>R.
      v. Fontaine</i>, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 702, at paras. 70-74. Save with respect
      to the limited weighing necessary to assess the inferences available from
      circumstantial evidence, the trial judge is not permitted to weigh the
      evidence, to make determinations about the credibility of witnesses, or
      to make findings of fact.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    applying the air of reality test, the trial judge must consider the totality
    of the evidence and is required to assume that the evidence relied upon by
    the accused is true:<i> Cinous</i> at para. 53. However, particularly where
    a jury is invited to reject parts of a person’s evidence that could be relevant
    to a proposed defence, it will be necessary for the trial judge to assess
    whether sufficient evidence will remain based on which a properly instructed
    jury acting reasonably could acquit if some or all the evidence relevant
    to a particular defence is rejected: <i>R. v. Park</i>, [1995] 2 S.C.R. 836.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    we have said, in this case, the trial judge’s decision that there was no
    air of reality to the defence of provocation appears to be premised on two
    factors: first, the appellant’s evidence disavowing anger as the trigger
    for his actions, and second, a finding that there was no evidence of the
    appellant acting in the heat of passion or as a result of a loss of self
    control.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree that there will be some cases in which the appellant’s disavowal of
    one of the elements of a defence will preclude the availability of the defence
    based on the air of reality threshold.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a> However, this is not one of those cases. In challenging
    the appellant’s evidence that he was afraid at the time he stabbed Mr. Garavellos,
    the Crown suggested, both in cross-examination and in his closing address
    to the jury, that the appellant’s true emotion was anger. If the jury rejected
    the appellant’s evidence that he was afraid, there was evidence capable of
    supporting an inference that he was angry. Similarly, there was evidence
    capable of supporting an inference that the appellant acted in the heat of
    passion or as a result of a loss of self-control. It was also open to the
    jury to conclude that the appellant was both frightened and angry.</p>

'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant testified that his actions in initially following and then hitting
    the car in which Mr. Garavellos and Mr. Medeiros were riding were motivated
    by anger at a perceived insult. Particularly in this context, it would have
    been open to the jury to infer that the appellant remained angry at Mr. Garavellos
    throughout subsequent events, and that his anger escalated because of Mr.
    Garavellos’s subsequent behaviour. It would have been open to the jury to
    interpret the appellant’s behaviour in retrieving his knife and returning
    to the scene of the confrontation as motivated by anger. In addition, it
    would have been open to the jury to conclude that the appellant perceived
    Mr. Garavellos’s statement “if you’re gonna do it, do it” as a taunt amounting
    to an insult within the meaning of s. 232 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.<a href="#_ftn2"

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    if the jury did not reject the appellant’s testimony that Mr. Garavellos
    swung the beer bottle at his head and his repeated testimony that he stabbed
    Mr. Garavellos as a reaction to Mr. Garavellos’s conduct, it would have been
    open to the jury to find that the appellant’s conduct was prompted by sudden
    rage. The fact that the appellant previously retreated from the confrontation,
    retrieved a knife, and then returned to the confrontation does not undermine
    the availability of this inference. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    despite the appellant’s disavowal of anger as his governing emotion, we conclude
    that it would have been open to the jury to find provocation capable of reducing
    murder to manslaughter if the jury rejected this aspect of the appellant’s
    evidence but did not reject the remainder.</p>

    utter a racial slur at the accused, she also said the accused shot the deceased
