  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants are in the land development business. They are presently engaged
    in a land development project near
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Barrie,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario. Up until August 16, 2007, Gordon Cobb, the common law husband of
    the respondent, held a 10% interest in the appellants’ interest in the project. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    that date, an order made in the matrimonial proceedings between Mr. Cobb
    and the respondent transferred that 10% interest to the respondent, subject
    to the appellants’ security interest in it. That security arose when Mr.
    Cobb signed over his 10% interest to the appellants as security for a loan
    he obtained from them, for which he also signed a promissory note. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Payment
    on the note was due on August 21, 2007, but Mr. Cobb defaulted. The appellants
    then enforced their security interest in the 10% interest, but were required
    by the court order in the matrimonial proceedings to hold it until September
    13, to give the respondent an opportunity to make submissions with respect
    to priorities. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once
    the respondent knew she was acquiring the 10% interest, she asked for an
    extension of the August 21 date but was refused. She then requested financial
    information with respect to the project, which was provided by September
    6. The respondent then determined that the 10% interest held as security
    was sound, and raised the necessary funds to repay in full the loan for which
    it was security. The respondent tendered payment on September 21, 2007. She
    then successfully applied for relief from forfeiture of the 10% security
    interest. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants appeal from that order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our opinion the appeal must be dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge correctly set out the three part legal test for relief
    from forfeiture and found that the respondent satisfied all three criteria.
    This conclusion is not displaced by the fact that she also considered the
    facts and circumstances of the matrimonial litigation to be a factor that
    would justify relief.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants concede that the second criterion is met, namely that the right
    of forfeiture was to secure the payment of money.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge found that the respondent’s conduct was reasonable in the
    circumstances thus meeting the first criterion. There is no basis to interfere
    with that finding. The respondent moved expeditiously to gather the necessary
    financial information, make the necessary judgment, and then gather the necessary
    funds to repay the loan.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the application judge determined that the respondent satisfied the third
    criterion as well, namely that there was a substantial disparity between
    the value of the property forfeited and the damage caused by the breach of
    Mr. Cobb’s obligation to repay the loan. In our view, there was evidence
    sufficient to sustain this finding. On the one hand the damage caused by
    the breach is the value of the loan, for which the respondent has now tendered
    full repayment. On the other hand, there was evidence that a senior manager
    of the appellants considered that once the project “got through”, the value
    of the 10% interest would be worth a lot of money over and above the value
    of the loan. Moreover, the actions of the appellants, who are experienced
    land developers, in paying a substantial sum to acquire the land for the
    project, and in continuing to invest the time and money since then to pursue
    its development, are supportive of this conclusion. We would not interfere
    with this finding.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal must therefore be dismissed, with costs to the respondent in the amount
    of $6,300 inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>
