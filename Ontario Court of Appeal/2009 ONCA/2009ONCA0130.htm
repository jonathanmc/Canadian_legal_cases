  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant appeals his conviction for first degree murder on three grounds.  We
    did not find it necessary to call upon Crown counsel to respond to those
    grounds of appeal and indicated at the conclusion of argument that we would
    provide brief written reasons for our decision that the appeal must be dismissed.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>1.         The
      admissibility of the drop cloths and shovel</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge erred in admitting evidence of the
    drop cloths and shovel found in the appellant’s car as evidence of planning
    and deliberation.  It was the theory of the Crown that the appellant and
    his accomplice had intended to kidnap the victim, kill him and bury him and
    that the appellant had purchased these items in pursuit of this plan.  These
    items were purchased only weeks before the killing, were unused and had been
    left in the vehicle since the time of purchase.  While they were suitable
    for use as part of the plan to kill the victim, they were largely unsuitable
    for any legitimate use associated with the vehicle.  In particular, as pointed
    out by Crown counsel at trial, the appellant already had another shovel especially
    designed to be carried in a car for use in digging out of snow.  While in
    the end the appellant’s car was not used to drive to the place where the
    victim was killed, the appellant’s car did contain other items such as the
    binoculars and walkie-talkies that were used during the killing.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    test for probative value is low, see <i>Morris v. The Queen</i>, [1983] 2
    S.C.R. 190; and it is sufficient that the desired inference is more probable
    with the evidence than it would be without the evidence.  The drop sheet
    and shovel meet this test.  No single piece of evidence bears the ultimate
    burden of proof and the impugned evidence could properly be used with the
    other evidence, especially the looped draw string found at the scene, to
    draw an inference that the killing was planned and deliberate.  The fact
    that over time the plan may have changed did not diminish the probative value
    of this evidence.  We do not agree with the appellant that the probative
    value of this evidence depended solely on the wiretap conversation with the
    accomplice, which was not led as evidence.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>2.         The
      use of the gun in the home invasion</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    was abundant evidence that the motive for killing the deceased was to prevent
    him from testifying against the appellant on a home invasion charge.  Thus,
    the evidence concerning the home invasion was properly admissible as part
    of the narrative and in particular as evidence of motive.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    was a dispute at trial as to whether the appellant or the accomplice owned
    the gun and brought it to the killing.  That the appellant brought the gun
    to the home invasion and regained possession of it after the home invasion,
    was some evidence that he owned the gun and therefore that he brought it
    to the killing.  This was then a piece of evidence to identify the appellant
    as the killer.  Thus, it was open to the trial judge to charge the jury that
    they could use this evidence to decide who as between the appellant and the
    accomplice brought the gun to the killing.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the evidence regarding the home invasion and the gun was admitted as evidence
    of motive, the trial judge discussed its use in the portion of his charge
    dealing with bad character evidence.  Under the heading “Bad Character Evidence
    About Mr.&nbsp;Jacobson”, the trial judge also outlined for the jury the
    permitted use of the evidence and the impermissible use.  In particular,
    the trial judge instructed the jury that they could not use “bad character
    evidence” to simply reason that the appellant was the type of person likely
    to commit the offence of murder.  Although it may have been preferable not
    to attach the bad character label to this evidence for the purpose of explaining
    its proper use, we are satisfied that the jury would not have misused the
    home invasion evidence and particularly the evidence concerning the gun.  </p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>3.         The
      search warrant issue</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge properly admitted the evidence found in the appellant’s vehicle
    notwithstanding the error in the search warrant.  The evidence was not conscriptive
    and there was substantial evidence of good faith on the part of the officers.  On
    all three occasions when the police conducted an investigation in relation
    to the vehicle, they obtained a search warrant.  In the first two warrants
    the address was set out correctly.  The information to obtain in relation
    to the third warrant contained the correct address.  Through a slip or oversight,
    the wrong address was put in the third warrant.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is a lesser expectation of privacy in a vehicle parked in an area to which
    the public have access than, say, a dwelling house.  Thus, the error in the
    warrant as to the location of the vehicle was relatively minor.  In other
    words, the violation of s. 8 of the <i>Charter </i>was not serious.  To exclude
    the evidence for this minor technical breach for what was no more than an
    inadvertent oversight would be more likely to bring the administration of
    justice into disrepute, than would admitting the evidence.</p>
