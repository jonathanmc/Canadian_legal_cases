style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
      October 7, 2005, the respondent was arrested on three charges of indecent
      assault allegedly committed against one complainant in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Elliot Lake, between January 1, 1971 and December 31, 1976. By December 2005,
    six other complainants had come forward and additional charges were laid.
    Following a five day preliminary hearing, the respondent was committed on
    nine counts of indecent assault involving  six complainants. All of the complainants,
    one of whom was the respondent’s own adopted daughter, were young girls,
    well below the age of fourteen when the assaults allegedly took place. The
    assaults allegedly occurred at various locations, including the respondent’s
    church and residence.</span></p>

      set for October 22, 2007 and thereafter adjourned to December 3, 2007.
      On that date, because of a scheduling error, the case was further adjourned
      to January 7, 2008 when an application for a stay of proceedings was heard.</span></p>

      charges to which the respondent entered a plea of not guilty, and a sentencing

    involving an accused by the name of Perdue, was also scheduled to proceed.

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>As
    the accused Perdue was incarcerated and the respondent free on bail, the

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>On
    December 11, 2007 the respondent filed his application for a stay of proceedings

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>In
    my view, it is important to note that in August 2007, the respondent was
    offered trial dates in September and early October but instead chose the
    December 3 date, knowing this case was one of three on the list. When the
    date was being set, counsel for the respondent indicated that if the October
    22 date were lost and the case could not be first on the December 3 date,
    he would “prefer” the matter go over to the spring of 2008. Counsel for the
    respondent indicated that even if the case were to remain on the October
    22 list, if it could not be listed as first, he still wished the case to
    be adjourned to the spring of 2008.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>In
    my view the delay does not exceed the range set out in <i>Morin</i> and is
    not in and of itself excessive in the context of this case. But whether that
    guideline is to be applied or not will depend on the presence or absence
    of prejudice.</p>
  <h3><u>Prejudice to the Respondent</u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>The
    second, third and fourth grounds of appeal raised all fall to be considered
    under the prejudice factor. As Sopinka J. stated in <i>Morin</i> at p. 798:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The application of the guideline will also be influenced
    by the presence or absence of prejudice. If an accused is in custody or,
    while not in custody, subject to restrictive bail terms or conditions or
    otherwise experiences substantial prejudice, the period of acceptable institutional
    delay may be shortened to reflect the court’s concern. On the other hand,
    in a case in which there is no prejudice or prejudice is slight, the guideline
    may be applied to reflect this fact.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>The
    trial judge appears to have concluded that a stay of the charges against
    the respondent was the appropriate remedy not only because of the inferred
    prejudice, which arose from the delay itself, but also because of actual
    prejudice to the respondent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>In
    his reasons, the trial judge recites the respondent’s physical difficulties
    arising from the fact that he suffers post-polio syndrome, the result of
    having suffered poliomyelitis as a small child. Now 75 years of age, living
    in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Belleville,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario, some 850 kilometres from Sault Ste. Marie, he observed:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[K.G.] testified he was required to use a cane
    since 1998 and began using a walker last year. He suffers from fatigue, general
    weakness and a fear of falling. He can drive a motor vehicle but finds winter
    driving very difficult because if he has to stop for gas or to go to the
    washroom, it is very difficult to do so in icy conditions without his walker.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[K.G.]  described the difficult time he had in
    driving to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Elliot Lake to attend his preliminary hearing in January of 2007. His doctor
    provided a letter strongly recommending that he not be required to travel
    during the winter months. The court tried to accommodate this by assigning
    a fall date for the trial but the delays resulted in the trial being adjourned
    to January 7, 2008, the middle of winter. Although Sault Ste. Marie is currently
    enjoying mild weather, I accept that the thought of having to drive from
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Belleville to Sault Ste. Marie in January caused [K.G.]  a great deal of
    anxiety. [K.G.]  testified that he is completely stressed out and anxious
    due to his inability to have these matters dealt with as soon as possible.
    He is now taking medication to relieve this anxiety. [K.G.’s] application
    is supported, in part, by his affidavit which describes the additional financial
    burden to him caused by the delays.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>On all of the evidence, I am satisfied [K.G.]  has
    suffered not only inferred prejudice from the delays but actual prejudice.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Having regard to the nature and seriousness of
    the charges, the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay and the resulting
    prejudice to [K.G.] it is my view that [K.G.’s]  rights under s. 11(b) of
    the<i> Charter</i> outweigh the societal interest in bringing him to trial,
    particularly since there is a real societal interest in seeing accused persons
    dealt with fairly. The appropriate remedy is to stay the charges against
    [K.G.].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>As
    this court noted in <i>R. v. Qureshi</i> (2004) 190 C.C.C. (3d) 453 at para.
    14:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Two kinds of prejudice are relevant [on a s. 11(b)
    application]. First, the court may infer prejudice from the delay itself
    and is more likely to do so the longer the delay. On the other hand, an accused’s
    action or inaction that shows a desire to avoid a trial on the merits may
    negate any inference of prejudice from the delay itself. Second, the accused
    or the Crown may lead evidence to show either prejudice or an absence of
    prejudice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>The
    trial judge concluded that the respondent suffered not only inferred prejudice
    from the delay but actual prejudice. In considering the prejudice occasioned
    by the delay, the trial judge reviewed the respondent’s health history including
    the difficulties it poses for him when he must travel in winter, as well
    as  his doctor’s  strong recommendation that he not travel in winter and
    concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I accept that the thought of having to drive from
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Belleville to Sault Ste Marie in January caused [K.G.] a great deal of anxiety.
    [K.G.] testified that he is completely stressed out and anxious due to his
    inability to have these matters dealt with as soon as possible. He is now
    taking medication to relieve this anxiety. [K.G.’s] application is supported
    in part by his affidavit which describes the additional financial burden
    to him caused by the delays.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>In
    the respondent’s affidavit filed in support of his s. 11(b) motion, there
    is no mention of stress occasioned to him by reason of the delay in bringing
    his charges to trial. That affidavit speaks only to his difficulties travelling
    during the winter months and the costs he has incurred as the result of his
    trial date being adjourned.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>However,
    in his evidence before the trial judge, the respondent did complain about
    the stress the delay in dealing with the charges had caused. The first exchange
    with his counsel in this respect is found in his evidence-in-chief:</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>Yes,

    was there was another person on the docket. He was supposed to be …</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>and there followed yet another
    discussion about the snow and ice in front of the court building and how
    difficult it was physically for the respondent to attend his trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>In
    cross-examination, the respondent said that he had not been made aware that
    his case was scheduled as a back-up case for the week of October 22, 2007.
    And while December 3, 2007 was not an appropriate date for him because it
    was in the winter which causes him a lot of stress, he stated that he did
    not want the matter adjourned to the spring of 2008 because:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I wanted it over as soon as possible.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>This
    evidence, of course, conflicts with the position taken by counsel on his
    behalf when the adjournment of the October 22, 2007 trial date was before
    the court. At that time counsel advised the court that if the case were to
    be adjourned, he would be asking that it go over to the warmer weather in
    the spring. In addition, three dates were offered – prior to October 22,
    2007 – when the trial could proceed as first case on the list, but none were
    apparently convenient to the respondent’s counsel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>The
    respondent’s physical disability and the particular stress that causes for
    him when he is required to travel in the winter months does not arise as
    the result of the criminal charges he faces, nor does it arise from any delay
    in bringing those charges to trial. These particular difficulties would be
    present even if K.G. had been tried in December 2005, shortly after the charges
    were laid. It does not give rise to actual prejudice. In reading the trial
    judge’s reasons as a whole, I accept the Crown’s submission that the trial
    judge did equate the respondent’s “travel prejudice”
    with the effects of being charged with serious criminal offences, and in
    so doing improperly found that actual prejudice flowed from the delay.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Clearly
    there is evidence that the fact of these charges has caused stress to the
    respondent and has been a source of friction between him and his wife, a
    fact true of anyone facing serious criminal charges. Institutional delay
    does not cause this stress –  it can only at best prolong, or exacerbate
    it. The respondent was prescribed medication for stress shortly after his
    arrest. On his evidence, only the amount he took increased when the case
    was adjourned. In other words, his need for medication to deal with the stress
    did not <i>arise</i> out of the delay – at best it was somewhat exacerbated
    by it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>No
    issue of delay was raised before October 22, 2007. The real delay about which
    complaint is made amounts to some two and one-half months – from October
    22, 2007 to January 7, 2008. Although the respondent mentions the continued
    stress of having these charges outstanding against him for this further period
    of time, again, it must be noted that he did not avail himself of the earlier
    dates offered at the time the matter was adjourned to December 3, 2007.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>In
    my view, the trial judge placed too much weight on the finding of prejudice,
    given that the contentious delay was primarily confined to this one short
    period.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>In
    so far as the respondent’s liberty interest is concerned, there was minimal
    interference in this case. The respondent was released on his Promise to
    Appear for both court and fingerprinting and gave an undertaking to attend
    court in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Elliot Lake on November 15, 2005. The respondent was to advise the investigating
    officer of any change of address, abstain from communicating with the complainant
    J. H. and to abstain from alcohol or other intoxicants, except as prescribed.
    The respondent filed a designation of counsel and accordingly did not personally
    appear – nor was he required to – on several of the occasions when his case
    was spoken to. He was not incarcerated, had no curfew and was not subject
    to any reporting requirements.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>There
    is no evidence, nor is it contended, that the delay has in any way impacted
    on the respondent’s fair trial rights in the sense that evidence has been
    lost or witnesses become unavailable because of delay.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>In
    considering the societal interest the trial judge’s reasons are conclusory.
    He merely stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[I]t is my view that [K.G.’s] rights under s. 11(b)
    of the <i>Charter</i> outweigh the societal interest in bringing him to trial,
    particularly since there is a real societal interest in seeing accused persons
    dealt with fairly.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Again,
    as this court stated in <i>R. v. Qureshi</i>, at para. 41:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The marginal prejudice to the respondents caused
    by the delay must be weighed against the considerable prejudice to society’s
    interest caused by a stay. The trial judge did not consider society’s interest.
    Yet the charges are serious – attempted murder and aggravated assault – which
    heightens society’s interest in having a trial on the merits.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Here
    the only societal interest considered by the trial judge was, as he put it, “the
    societal interest in seeing accused persons dealt with fairly”. Nowhere does
    he mention the societal interest in seeing those charged with serious offences
    brought to trial and dealt with according to law. In failing to consider
    this aspect of the societal interest, he erred.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Any
    prejudice to the respondent by reason of the delay here was slight. In the
    circumstances it is appropriate that the guideline as expressed in <i>Morin</i> be
    applied to reflect this fact.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>In
    the absence of any real prejudice beyond that experienced by all accused
    persons, and the important public interest in a trial on the merits, I am
    of the view that the delay in this case was not unconstitutional.</p>
  <h3><u>Charges to Which the Respondent Pled Guilty before the Stay was Imposed</u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>Following
    the granting of the stay of proceedings, the trial judge invited defence
    counsel to make submissions as to  whether the stay should also apply to
    the three counts to which the respondent pled guilty earlier in the day.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>The
    respondent’s responses at the time of his arraignment, which took place moments
    before the 11(b) application, bear repetition:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>COURT REGISTRAR: [K.G.] , [K.G.G.] on
    count one stands charged that he on or between the 1<sup>st</sup> day of
    January, 1971 and the 31<sup>st</sup> day of December 1976 at the City of
    Elliot Lake, in the said region, did indecently assault[J.H.], a female person,
    contrary to section 149 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> <i>of Canada</i>, 1953-56,
    c. 51, s. 141; 1972, c. 13, s. 70. On count one, how do you plead guilty
    or not guilty?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>K.G.:   There’s more to it than that.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>MR. BERTHELOT:   There’s two other counts.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>K.G.:   Oh, okay, guilty.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>THE COURT:   The plea is guilty? Okay.
    Thank you.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>COURT REGISTRAR:  On count two, [K.G.G.] stands
    further charged that he on or between the 1<sup>st</sup> day of January,
    1971 an the 31<sup>st</sup> day of December 1976 at the City of Elliot Lake,
    in the said Region, did indecently assault [J.H.], a female person, contrary
    to section 149, of the <i>Criminal Code of Canada</i>, 1953-56, c. 51, s.
    141; 1972, c. 13, s. 70. On count two, how do  you plead, guilty or not guilty?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>K.G.:   Guilty.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>COURT REGISTRAR: On count three, [K.G.G.]
    stands further charged that he on or between the 1<sup>st</sup> day of January,
    1971 and the 31s day of December, 1976, at the City of Elliot Lake, in the
    said Region, did indecently assault [J.H.], a female person, contrary to
    section 149 of the <i>Criminal Code of Canada</i>, 1953-56, c. 51, s. 141;
    1972, c. 13, s. 70. On count three, how do you plead, guilty or not guilty?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>K.G.:   Guilty.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>There
    followed a reading of counts four through nine and to all of those charges
    the respondent entered a plea of not guilty. After taking the respondent’s
    plea on the last charge the court registrar, as is usual, said to the respondent:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Listen to your plea as the court has recorded it:  you
    plead guilty to count one, guilty to count two, guilty to count three, not
    guilty to count four, not guilty to count five, not guilty to count six,
    not guilty to count seven, not guilty to count eight and not guilty to count
    nine.  Is that correct?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>K.G.:   Absolutely correct.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>It
    is clear from his comment after the first count was read to him that the
    respondent was informed and aware of what he was pleading guilty to. After
    that first count was read, he said that “there’s more to it than that”. His
    lawyer then explained that there were two – not eight – other counts, in
    obvious reference to the second and third counts, about to follow and to
    which he was also about to enter a plea of guilty.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>The
    record here discloses no basis upon which those pleas of guilty should be
    struck. The respondent was represented by counsel throughout. It is apparent
    the pleas were both informed and voluntary. On these charges the respondent
    should be remanded to the Superior Court for sentencing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'> </span>In
    result, the appeal is allowed. The stay of proceeding is set aside. The respondent
    is remanded to the Superior Court at Sault Ste. Marie for trial on counts
    four through nine of the indictment and for sentencing on counts one through
    three.</p>
