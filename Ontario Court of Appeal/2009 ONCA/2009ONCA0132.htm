style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Doe’s chief ground of appeal is that the motion judge erred <span lang=EN-US>in
    finding that
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario had no obligation to provide him with new and secure identity documents
    in a timely manner after he entered the Witness Protection Program (the “Program”).  He
    claims that the Letter of Agreement he signed with
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario, which secured his entry into the Witness Protection Program, as
    well as additional oral and written representations made by the police and
    government officials, required
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario to provide him with these identity documents within a reasonable
    period of time. Although he ultimately did receive a new identity, he now
    feels that it has been compromised and thus seeks a second new identity.
    He further seeks compensation for the losses he claims to have suffered due
    to the government’s delay.</span></p>

      Mr. Doe appeals on the grounds that the motion judge erred in applying
      the release provision of the Letter of Agreement too broadly, and in concluding
      that Mr. Doe had been properly terminated from the Witness Protection Program
      without notice.</span></p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant, Mr. Doe, worked as a small business owner for many years. As a
    result of a soured business investment, Mr. Doe became the victim of criminal
    activity. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Doe reported the criminal activity to the Ontario Provincial Police (the “OPP”),
    and a criminal investigation commenced. Shortly thereafter, he completed
    an application form to be admitted into the Witness Protection Program and
    was taken into protective custody. He was immediately moved to a secure location,
    where he was provided with a health card under his new name and a new bank
    card within six weeks. At this time, Mr. Doe also began receiving financial
    assistance from the OPP.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the following months, Mr. Doe assisted the OPP with its investigation. Two
    individuals were charged, and Mr. Doe testified against them at their preliminary
    inquiry.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    be eligible for a secure name change, Mr. Doe was required to clear all outstanding
    debts, which included the lengthy process of selling his home. Approximately
    three months after he testified at the preliminary inquiry,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario offered Mr. Doe formal admission to the Program. To become a participant,
    Mr. Doe was required to sign a standard form contract provided by the Ministry
    of the Attorney General (the “Ministry”), called the Letter of Agreement.
    Generally, the Letter of Agreement provided that the Ministry would reimburse
    the police for certain security-related costs associated with Mr. Doe’s relocation;
    provide financial assistance for rent and other living expenses not exceeding
    $1,350 per month for a period of up to six months; provide financial assistance
    with life insurance premiums in an amount not exceeding $600; and provide
    a medical allowance not to exceed $2,000. In exchange, Mr.&nbsp;Doe would
    be required to abide by several conditions, including an obligation not to
    breach his own security while in the Program. The Letter of Agreement also
    contained a provision releasing the Ministry and the OPP from any and all
    claims arising out of Mr.&nbsp;Doe’s role as a witness in the case. Although
    the Ministry formally administers the Program, many of the operational functions
    are performed by the OPP.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Through
    counsel, Mr. Doe attempted to negotiate several changes to the Letter of
    Agreement. The Ministry refused to make any changes to the standard form
    of the contract. However, the Ministry indicated by letter that approval
    for Mr. Doe’s confidential change of identity was subsumed within point (ii)
    of the Letter of Agreement, which obligated the government to reimburse the
    OPP “for certain security costs incurred by them, including certain relocation
    and start-up expenses.” In a second letter, the Ministry stated that “the
    police will seek to obtain as quickly as reasonably possible all the necessary
    federal and provincial identity documents, which include a new driver’s license,
    health card, SIN, birth certificate, and passport.” The letter further noted
    that the processing of federal documents could be time-consuming.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Shortly
    after receiving the letters from the Ministry, Mr. Doe signed the Letter
    of Agreement with independent legal advice. After Mr. Doe entered the Program,
    the Ministry indicated by letter that it would make every reasonable effort
    to obtain a new business licence for Mr. Doe so that he could find employment
    in his chosen field.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two
    months after signing the Letter of Agreement, Mr. Doe received a birth certificate
    in his new identity. It took approximately seven months for him to receive
    a Social Insurance Number (“SIN”) in his new name, and almost a full year
    before he received his new passport and business licence. Due to the delay
    in obtaining the new business licence, the Ministry voluntarily agreed to
    extend Mr. Doe’s monthly financial assistance until after he had received
    his licence. At about the time he received his new SIN, Mr. Doe was relocated
    to an out-of-province location and arrangements were made with the RCMP for
    him to also become a participant in the federal Witness Protection Program. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Doe’s main complaint stems from the fact that
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario was very slow in providing the documents he needed to live and work.
    In particular, from the date he entered protective custody, it took 17 months
    to receive his new birth certificate, 22 months for his SIN card, and 27
    months to obtain a new trade licence and passport. Further to that, although
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario eventually provided Mr. Doe with new identity documents, it did not
    provide him with a full new identity including a personal, work or financial
    history that he could use as the basis for a new life. As a result, Mr. Doe
    was forced to borrow money from old friends and acquaintances both to live
    and to establish a new business, as he could not obtain commercial credit.
    After receiving mail in his old name at his new address, Mr. Doe considered
    that his new identity had been compromised. He felt he had to leave
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    to work in another country, although his status there is apparently not regularized.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    Mr. Doe’s insistence, the OPP agreed to assist him in transferring a life
    insurance policy registered under his former name to his new identity. The
    transfer process began after Mr. Doe received his new SIN card, and required
    him to complete a new beneficiary designation form and undergo a fresh medical
    examination. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Around
    this time, the OPP became aware that advertisements for Mr. Doe’s new business
    venture containing information that put his new identity at risk had appeared
    in the media and on the internet. The OPP warned Mr. Doe that the advertisements
    constituted a breach of his personal security and violated his obligations
    under the Letter of Agreement. Upon learning that the advertisements remained
    available on the internet despite the OPP’s warning, the Ministry terminated
    Mr. Doe’s participation in the Program without notice. Mr. Doe’s termination
    from the Program occurred prior to his medical examination and the OPP never
    completed the transfer of his life insurance policy to his new identity.
    Shortly thereafter, Mr. Doe was also terminated from the federal Witness
    Protection Program. Although Mr. Doe subsequently had the option of re-instating
    his life insurance policy, he did not feel that he would be able to pass
    the required medical examination and, in any event, he was terminated from
    the Ontario Program before he could do so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Doe subsequently commenced an action against
    <st1:State

    Ontario and
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    for breach of contract, negligence, negligent misrepresentation, breach of
    fiduciary duty, abuse of power, intentional and negligent infliction of mental
    anguish, and breach of his s. 7 rights under the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights
    and Freedoms</i>. He seeks damages of $1.7 million, a declaration that he
    should be reinstated into the Program, and a declaration that he is entitled
    to a new secure identity. Specifically, with respect to the time period Mr.
    Doe was without his new secure identity documents, he seeks damages for loss
    of income, as well as for mental distress and anguish. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    separate proceedings, Mr. Doe successfully sought judicial review of the
    RCMP’s decision to terminate him from the federal Witness Protection Program: <i>John
    Doe v.
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    (Attorney General)</i> (2006), 286 F.T.R. 233. Phelan J. of the Federal Court
    of Canada quashed the RCMP’s decision on the ground of procedural fairness,
    because Mr. Doe had not been given the opportunity to respond to the OPP’s
    allegations that he had breached his security. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal;
'><b>MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge granted
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place

    Ontario’s motion for summary judgment, holding that Mr. Doe was unable to
    show there was a genuine issue for trial on any of his claims. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to Mr. Doe’s claims of breach of contract, the motion judge found
    that
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario had met, and in fact exceeded, its financial obligations to Mr. Doe
    under the Letter of Agreement. As to Mr. Doe’s new identity documents, the
    motion judge concluded that Ontario had kept its promise to provide Mr. Doe
    with a secure name change, notwithstanding that the Letter of Agreement did “not
    even specify what identification documents he was to receive and rather indicates
    only that the police will be reimbursed for certain security costs” and that “[n]o
    time limit for obtaining documents is expressed.” Further, with respect to
    all Mr. Doe’s claims, the motion judge held that the release contained in
    the Letter of Agreement barred Mr. Doe from pursuing any and all claims against
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario arising out of his role as a witness in the case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge also held that Mr. Doe had not met the evidentiary onus on him
    under a motion for summary judgment. He found that Mr. Doe had not substantiated
    his allegations of breach of contract or negligence as particularized in
    his statement of claim, and had not provided sufficient evidence to rebut
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario’s claim that it had satisfied its modest obligations under the Letter
    of Agreement. As to the legality of Mr. Doe’s termination from the Program,
    the motion judge specifically rejected Mr. Doe’s evidence that he was unaware
    that the public advertisements for his new business constituted a breach
    of security and that his conduct in this regard was inadvertent. Perhaps
    due to a typographical error in reproducing relevant portions of the Letter
    of Agreement, the motion judge implicitly accepted that Mr. Doe could be
    terminated from the Program without notice, and, therefore, he did not address
    the requirement in the Letter of Agreement for notice prior to termination.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge then went on to consider whether there was a genuine issue for
    trial as to Mr. Doe’s claims that Ontario breached its fiduciary duty to
    him, engaged in an abuse of power, and that his s. 7 <i>Charter</i> rights
    were violated when he was terminated from the Program without being afforded
    the opportunity to respond.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge first considered Mr. Doe’s <i>Charter</i> arguments. He held
    that Mr.&nbsp;Doe failed to show that
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario had deprived him of his life, liberty, or security of the person.
    Additionally, even if Mr. Doe could prove that he was deprived of any of
    these rights, the motion judge stated that there was no principle of fundamental
    justice requiring that a witness be given the opportunity to respond to allegations
    of wrongdoing before being terminated from a witness protection program.
    He also found that Mr. Doe had not adduced any evidence of <i>mala fides</i> or
    wilfulness on the part of
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario, which was necessary in order to ground a claim for damages from
    a breach of a <i>Charter</i> right. Similarly, there was no evidence to suggest
    that
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario intentionally engaged in unlawful conduct in the exercise of public
    functions, a constituent element of the tort of abuse of power.</p>

line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the question of breach of fiduciary duty, the motion judge assumed without
    deciding that
    <st1:State w:st="on">

    due to a combination of circumstances, it took much longer than expected
    for Mr. Doe to receive all the identification documents that he needed in
    order to carry on life under his new identity. As a result, the financial
    compensation contemplated by the Letter of Agreement to last six months was
    completely inadequate, as Mr. Doe was not able to work at the end of that
    period and required more support. Recognizing the situation,
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario provided an additional six months of financial assistance. In total,
    from the date Mr. Doe entered protective custody, he received 27 months of
    financial support.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    aspects of Mr. Doe’s relocation also did not go smoothly or as expected.
    He was supposed to have his life insurance policy transferred to his new
    identity and premiums were to be paid on his behalf in the interim up to
    $600. Mr. Doe was concerned that a new medical was required. Before Mr. Doe
    took steps to complete the medical examination as part of the policy transfer
    process, he was terminated from the Program. His life insurance ultimately
    lapsed and he lost his investment in it.</p>

    <st1:place w:st="on">

line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Doe is extremely unhappy with his life as matters currently stand. Feeling
    insecure in his new identity, he abandoned his new business, which has caused
    him new financial problems. He indicates that the RCMP are prepared to assist
    him with any outstanding issues regarding his passport. This is commendable
    and should be pursued.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my observation, based on what occurred in this case, there are clear problems
    with the Ontario Witness Protection Program as it is currently administered.
    In this case, the Letter of Agreement was entered into only after the witness
    had testified, at which time he was dependent on the government for protection
    and assistance. Further, the agreement is in a standard form and non-negotiable,
    and did not conform to all of the oral and written representations made by
    government officials in the earlier stages of the process. It is, in fact,
    a relatively short document and provides little detail as to the government’s
    obligations under the Program. For instance, while a secure name change is
    a fundamental component of a witness protection program, the Letter of Agreement
    itself is silent on what identity documents the government will provide and
    any timeframe for doing so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More
    importantly, it appears that neither level of government has implemented
    procedures to expedite the necessary processes, documentary and otherwise,
    for a witness to obtain a whole new identity, and for that identity to be
    sufficiently documented to allow the witness to effectively begin a new life.  The
    question of credit history, life insurance, passports, professional certificates,
    to name a few issues that arose in this case, should be anticipated and fully
    considered in the context of witness protection programs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>People
    who agree to assist the administration of justice by testifying in the face
    of serious personal danger may be forced to change their lives forever. In
    Mr. Doe’s case, on top of everything else, he was isolated from family and
    friends so that his support network was significantly diminished. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario’s Program is intended to assist people who are in a very vulnerable
    situation, it should be structured and administered to operate efficiently,
    effectively and unambiguously. For example, because the government’s Letter
    of Agreement contains everything it promises to do, that agreement should
    be entered into as soon as possible after the person has agreed to testify,
    so that there is no need for oral discussion or representations that may
    be interpreted as changing or in fact exceeding what the government intends
    to provide. As another example, the agreement should list exactly what the
    government will provide in terms of documents, financial and non-financial
    support, the anticipated timelines for the provision of the committed services,
    and the duration of the agreement.</p>

    this case, errors were made by both sides. The Program offered by the government
    was not as comprehensive as Mr. Doe expected and considered necessary in
    order to live under a new identity. However, Mr. Doe himself did not take
    all steps necessary to protect his own security nor did he act in a financially
    prudent manner in order to have the best chance to make a successful new
    start. </p>

    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario in fulfilling its obligations to Mr. Doe, it recognized those problems

    Ontario’s decision to terminate Mr. Doe from the Program lies at the crux

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario terminated the agreement following a warning to Mr.&nbsp;Doe that
    certain advertisements commissioned by him constituted a breach of his security.
    Mr. Doe put his best foot forward to explain his actions in that regard.
    The motion judge rejected Mr. Doe’s explanation as unreasonable and characterized
    it simply as an excuse. Because the motion judge had all the available evidence
    on this issue before him, he was entitled to make the finding he did and
    to therefore conclude that there was no genuine issue that required a trial.</p>
