style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant was charged that he:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='
text-align:left'>did by means of a computer system within the meaning of subsection
    342.1(2) of the <i>Criminal Code of Canada</i>, communicate with a person
    he believed to be under the age of 14 years for the purpose of facilitating
    the commission of an offence under subsection 173(2)contrary to the <i>Criminal
    Code of Canada</i> section 172.1(1)(c).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>He
    was convicted after a trial in the Ontario Court of Justice and sentenced
    to a term of imprisonment of ninety days to be served intermittently and
    to be followed by two years of probation.  He was also ordered to comply
    with the <i>Sex Offender Information Registration Act</i>, S.C. 2004, c.
    10.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant appeals from his conviction and sentence.  I would dismiss the

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for the appellant advanced five grounds of appeal.  The court required submissions
    from the Crown on two of those grounds, both relating to the interpretation
    of the applicable <i>Criminal Code</i> provisions.  The other arguments advanced
    by the appellant concerned the trial judges ruling that the appellants
    right to a trial within a reasonable time was not breached and his reasons
    for conviction.  We agree with the s. 11(b) ruling and see no error in the
    trial judges analysis of the evidence or his application of the relevant
    legal principles to that evidence.  The remainder of these reasons will address
    the two issues on which the court required submissions from the Crown.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is unnecessary to review the evidence in any detail.  The two arguments addressed
    in these reasons assume the facts as found by the trial judge.  Counsel argues
    that on those facts, the appellant did not commit the offence created by
    s. 172.1(1)(c).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant, while on his computer in his home in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Woodbridge,
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario, entered a chat room under the screen name slickman69a.  He struck
    up a conversation with a person using the screen name two_tongues13.  Unbeknownst
    to the appellant, this person was Detective Constable Gary Rubie of the Peel
    Regional Police Internet Child Exploitation Unit.  Constable Rubie was posing
    as a young girl.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant quickly moved the conversation in a sexual direction.  He offered
    to cum and make u feel better.  He asked two_tongues13 if she had a picture
    of herself and how old she was.  When two_tongues13 asked the appellant how
    old he was, he responded 69 and then added I like 69 do u.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Constable
    Rubie left the chat for about twenty minutes in order to set up the software
    needed to fully record the remainder of the interaction between the appellant
    and two_tongues13.  During this break, the appellant repeatedly tried to
    renew his dialogue with two_tongues13. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

    Constable Rubie returned to the chat, the appellant asked two_tongues13 if
    she would like to see my cam.  The appellant added that he was nude and
    asked two_tongues13 if she would like to see.  Two_tongues13 expressed
    concern about her mother being around and about getting into trouble.  The
    appellant repeated his offer.  Two_tongues13 then said but im only 13.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant made one apparent failed effort to send an image of himself in
    the nude to two_tongues13.  Then, he set up his webcam so that it was focused
    on his genitals and transmitted a video to two_tongues13 of himself masturbating
    to ejaculation.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant testified in his own defence.  He initially indicated that he was
    not sure that he was the person chatting with two_tongues13 and masturbating
    to ejaculation.  The appellant eventually acknowledged that it was him, but
    insisted that he believed that two_tongues13 was at least eighteen years
    of age.  He testified that he had reviewed the electronic profile of two_tongues13
    in which she was described as eighteen years of age.  He also understood
    that persons could not enter this particular chat room if they were under
    eighteen.  </p>

    appellant was asked what he thought when two_tongues13 said, but im only
    13.  The appellant replied that everybody, including him, lies about their
    age in chat rooms.  The appellant also said that he did not think the speaker
    was referring to her age when she said but im only 13. </p>

    surprisingly, the trial judge rejected the appellants evidence in its entirety.  He
    concluded:  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='
text-align:left'>I do not think there is anything remotely resembling a reasonable
    effort to determine the true age of the person he was dealing with here indeed.  He
    could have nothing in his mind other than he was sending images of himself
    over the Internet masturbating to a 13 year old. </p>

    language used by the trial judge reflects the content of ss. 172.1(3) and
    (4).  In the context of a charge under s. 172.1(1)(c), s. 172.1(3) provides
    that where the person with whom an accused is communicating is represented
    to be under fourteen years of age, that representation is proof, in the absence
    of evidence to the contrary, that the accused believed the person to be under
    fourteen.  Section 172.1(4) declares that an accuseds belief that a person
    is over fourteen is not a defence unless the accused took reasonable steps
    to ascertain the age of the person.</p>

    the applicable legislation and the evidence, the trial judges findings of
    fact are fully justified.  The legal issues raised by counsel must be considered
    on the basis that the appellant, believing he was communicating via his computer
    with a thirteen year old girl, masturbated to ejaculation and transmitted
    a video of that act to the person he believed to be thirteen years of age.  </p>

  <h2>(1)       Whether s. 172.1(1)(c) can apply to communications with a person

    appellant was charged under s. 172.1(1)(c) of the <i>Code </i>with communicating
    over a computer system for the purpose of facilitating the commission of
    an offence under s. 173(2).   Since the communication under s. 172.1(1)(c)
    must be for the purpose of facilitating the designated offence with respect
    to that person, and an offence under s. 173(2) requires exposure of ones
    genitals to a person who is actually under the age of fourteen years, the
    appellant submits that he could not be found guilty of the offence charged
    because the person the appellant was communicating with, Constable Rubie,
    was not, in fact, under the age of fourteen years.  On this interpretation
    of s. 172.1(1)(c), the appellants belief that he was exposing himself to
    a thirteen year old child would not be enough to fix him with liability.  Rather,
    the offence is made out only where the person with whom an accused is communicating
    for the purpose of facilitating an offence under s. 173(2) is in fact under
    fourteen years of age.</p>

    argument turns on the interpretation of s. 172.1(1)(c).  The process of statutory
    interpretation requires that a provision in a statute be read contextually,
    in a manner that reflects the grammatical and ordinary meaning of the words
    used, that accords with the scheme and object of the statute, and that reflects
    the intention of the legislature:  <i>R. v. Clark</i>, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 6,
    at para. 43.  The aim of the interpretative exercise is to discern the meaning
    of the statutory provision, not to define the individual words or phrases
    used in the provision.  </p>

    examining the specific language of s. 172.1(1)(c), it is helpful to consider
    s. 172.1 on a more general level.  The crimes created by that section target
    a specific kind of conduct, the communication by means of a computer with
    a person who is, or is believed to be, below a certain age.  That conduct
    is not in and of itself criminal, illegal, or necessarily inappropriate.  The
    section criminalizes that conduct only if it is accompanied by the intention
    to facilitate the commission of one of the crimes designated in s. 172.1.  All
    those designated crimes are crimes against young persons and all potentially
    involve the sexual exploitation of young people.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>By
    criminalizing conduct that is preparatory to the commission of the designated
    offences, Parliament has sought to protect the potential child victims of
    those designated crimes by allowing the criminal law to intervene before
    the actual harm caused by the commission, or even the attempted commission,
    of one of the designated offences occurs.  Section 172.1 creates what Professor
    Ashworth refers to as essentially inchoate crimes, described in substantive
    offence terms:  Andrew Ashworth, <i>Principles of Criminal Law</i>, 5th ed.
    (

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    offences created by s. 172.1, like the inchoate crimes of conspiracy, attempt
    and counselling, are prophylactic in that they seek to prevent the commission
    of the designated crimes by criminalizing conduct that occurs on the way
    toward the commission of the designated crimes.  Also like the inchoate offences,
    justification for criminalizing the conduct described in s. 172.1 is found
    in the required <i>mens rea</i>.  It is the intention to facilitate the commission
    of one or more of the designated offences that makes the accuseds otherwise
    lawful conduct, sufficiently harmful and potentially dangerous to warrant
    the imposition of criminal sanction.  The words of McIntyre J. in <i>R. v.
    Ancio</i>, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 225, at pp. 247-248, although addressing the crime
    of attempt, apply to the crimes created by s. 172.1:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='
text-align:left'>[T]he intent to commit the desired offence is a basic element
    of the offence of attempt.  Indeed, because the crime of attempt may be complete
    without the actual commission of any other offence and even without the performance
    of any act unlawful in itself, <i>it is abundantly clear that the criminal
    element of the offence of attempt may lie solely in the intent</i>. [Emphasis
    added.]</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Recognizing
    that s. 172.1 creates what are in essence inchoate crimes assists in placing
    the appellants submission within the context of the broader criminal law
    principles that address the scope of criminal liability.  The appellants
    submission, although anchored in the closing phrase of s. 172.1(1)(c), is
    in reality a contention that the defence of impossibility is available to
    a charge under that section.  It is contended that because the appellant
    did everything he intended to do, that is exposed himself to two_tongues13,
    and yet did not commit an offence under s. 173(2), because two_tongues 13
    was in fact an adult male, he could not be convicted of communicating for
    the purpose of facilitating that offence.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    submission echoes the submission advanced and rejected in <i>United States
    of America v. Dynar</i>, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 462.  In <i>Dynar</i>, it was alleged
    that the accused had attempted to launder money, and conspired to launder
    money.  The accused believed that the money to be laundered was from the
    proceeds of illegal drug trafficking.  In reality, the accused was the target
    of a police sting operation and the money had come from the public coffer.  It
    was argued that because the money the accused attempted to launder was not
    in fact the proceeds of crime, he could not be convicted of attempting to
    launder the proceeds of crime, even though he believed that the money was
    the proceeds of crime.  The same argument was made with respect to the conspiracy
    allegation.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    majority in the Supreme Court of Canada acknowledged the longstanding academic
    debate over whether the impossibility of committing the completed crime could
    ever provide a defence to a charge of attempting to commit that crime or
    conspiracy to commit that crime.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[4]</span></span></span></a>  The majority concluded that impossibility of
    completion should not provide a defence to attempt or conspiracy.  It determined
    that on a charge of attempt or conspiracy, the accuseds <i>mens rea</i> had
    to be determined based on the material circumstances as the accused believed
    them to be.  Consequently, in <i>Dynar</i>, what mattered for the purposes
    of the attempt and conspiracy charges was whether the accused believed the
    money to be the proceeds of crime and not whether the money was in fact the
    proceeds of crime.  The majority justified this holding as consistent with
    both the preventative rationale underlying inchoate liability and the generally
    accepted subjective nature of <i>mens rea</i> in criminal matters.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    majority squarely addressed the appropriateness of criminalizing inchoate
    offences where the full crime could not be committed in addressing the conspiracy
    charge, at para. 91:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='
text-align:left'>Does it make any difference to the potential liability of the
    conspirators that they could not have committed the substantive offence even
    if they had done everything they set out to do?  <i>Put another way, should
    conspirators escape liability because, owing to matters entirely outside
    their control, they are mistaken with regard to an attendant circumstance
    that must exist for their plan to be successful?</i><u>  </u><i>Such a result
    would defy logic and could not be justified.</i>  [Emphasis added.]</p>

    were.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5"

    the nature of the offences created by s. 172.1 and the principles set down
    in <i>Dynar</i>, the accuseds inability to complete the offence he sought
    to facilitate should provide no defence to the charge.  It is, of course,
    always open to Parliament to provide a defence that would not be available
    under generally applicable criminal law principles.  I turn now to the language

    first of these elements, communication by means of a computer system, describes
    part of the prohibited conduct, or <i>actus
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    reus</i> of the crime.  In keeping with general criminal law principles,
    that conduct must be voluntary to attract criminal liability:  Don Stuart, <i>Canadian
    Criminal Law: A Treatise</i>, 5th ed. (

    second element of the offence, the age of the person to whom the communication
    is made, or the accuseds belief as to the age of that person, is also part
    of the conduct prohibited by the offence.  If the person to whom the communication
    is made is under fourteen years of age, his or her age is a condition or
    circumstance that must be proven by the Crown to complete the <i>actus
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    reus</i>.  If the person with whom the communication is made is over fourteen,
    but the accused believes he or she is under fourteen, the accuseds belief
    is the circumstance or condition that the Crown must prove to establish the
    prohibited act.  The language of the section draws no distinction between
    communicating with a child who is under fourteen and communicating with a
    child who the accused believes is under fourteen.</p>

    third element describes the fault component, or <i>mens rea</i>, of the offence
    created by s. 172.1(1)(c).  The accused must engage in the prohibited communication
    with the specific intent of facilitating the commission of one of the designated
    offences with respect to that person.  In this case, the Crown had to prove
    that when the accused communicated with two_tongues13 in the chat room, his
    purpose or intent was to facilitate the exposure of his genital organs to
    two_tongues13, a person he believed to be under fourteen years of age.  </p>

    plain reading of the words of the section offers no support for the appellants
    contention that the offence is only committed if the intended exposure is
    to a person who is actually under fourteen.  This submission confuses the
    elements of the completed offence created by s. 173(2) and the <i>mens rea</i> that
    the Crown must prove to establish the inchoate offence described in s. 172.1(1)(c).  The
    former looks to what happened, the latter to what the accused believed could
    happen.  If the Crown proves that the culpable <i>mens rea</i> existed with
    the prohibited conduct, the offence under s. 172.1(1)(c) is made out regardless
    of whether the designated crime is ever committed, attempted or is even factually
    possible.  </p>

    I agree that on the wording of the section, the criminal purpose must be
    in respect of the person with whom the accused is communicating, there is
    no language supporting the contention that the criminal purpose is culpable
    only if the accused is actually able to bring that purpose to fruition and
    commit the designated offence with the person to whom the communication is
    made.  This element of the offence created by s. 172.1(1)(c) focuses on the
    accuseds purpose in making the communication.  Purpose is a state of mind.  The
    appellant believed he was communicating with a child under fourteen years
    of age.  It is that belief, not the actual age of the person with whom he
    was communicating, that is relevant to the accuseds purpose in engaging
    in the communication.</p>

    considering the appellants interpretation of s. 172.1(1)(c), I must, of
    course, examine the entire provision.  I agree with the Crowns submission
    that the appellants interpretation renders a significant part of s. 172.1(1)(c)
    meaningless.  The section specifically targets for protection either a person
    who is under fourteen years of age or a person who the accused believes
    is under the age of fourteen years.  If the appellants submission is correct,
    communication with a person who is not under fourteen but who the accused
    believes to be under fourteen years of age could never result in the commission
    of the offence created by s. 172.1(1)(c).  The appellants interpretation
    reads the phrase the accused believes is under the age of fourteen years out
    of the section and would defeat Parliaments clear intention to capture communications
    with that class of persons.  </p>

    years of age.  A consideration of the language in the context of the clear

    engage in anonymous, low visibility and repeated contact with potentially
    vulnerable children.  The Internet can be a fertile breeding ground for the
    grooming and preparation associated with the sexual exploitation of children
    by adults.  One author has described the danger in these terms:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='
text-align:left'>For those inclined to use computers as a tool for the achievement
    of criminal ends, the Internet provides a vast, rapid and inexpensive way
    to commit, attempt to commit, counsel or facilitate the commission of unlawful
    acts.  The Internets one-too-many broadcast capability allows offenders
    to cast their nets widely.  It also allows these nets to be cast anonymously
    or through misrepresentation as to the communicators true identity.  Too
    often, these nets ensnare, as theyre designed to, the most vulnerable members
    of our community  children and youth.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='
text-align:left'></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='
text-align:left'>Cyberspace also provides abuse-intent adults with unprecedented
    opportunities for interacting with children that would almost certainly be
    blocked in the physical world.  The rapid development and convergence of
    new technologies will only serve to compound the problem.  Children are the
    front-runners in the use of new technologies and in the exploration of social
    life within virtual settings.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span

    appellant, by his conduct, made it crystal clear that he is prepared to use
    Internet communication with a child to facilitate his sexual exploitation
    of a child.  It would undermine entirely the purpose of the provision if
    the appellant could escape liability where, despite his best efforts to expose
    himself to a child, he could not succeed because, unbeknownst to him, he
    was actually communicating with a police officer.  </p>

    appellants interpretation of s. 172.1(1)(c) would significantly undermine
    the object of that statutory provision in a second way.  If the appellants
    interpretation is accepted, communications between an accused and a police
    officer who an accused believes to be a young person could not result in
    a conviction under s. 172.1(1)(c).  A review of the case law demonstrates
    that police officers posing as young persons is almost the exclusive manner
    in which this provision is enforced.  This is hardly surprising.  Children
    cannot be expected to police the Internet.  The state is charged with the
    responsibility of protecting its children.  That responsibility requires
    not only that the appropriate laws be passed, but that those laws be enforced.  The
    appellants interpretation would render the section close to a dead letter.      </p>

    appellant submits that the phrase in any place in s. 173(2) means that
    the accused person who exposes him or herself must be in the same physical
    location as the victim of the exposure.  I quote from counsels factum:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='
text-align:left'>[T]he section is referring to a physical location encompassing
    the victim as well as the accused.  It is therefore respectfully submitted
    that sending moving or still images over the Internet does not constitute
    exposing oneself in a place as required by s. 173(2). </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>According
    to the appellant, it would follow that an offence under s. 172.1(1)(c) of
    communicating for the purpose of facilitating the commission of an offence
    under s. 173(2) could not be established unless the communication evidenced
    some form of intended direct contact. </p>

    in the language of s. 173(2) suggests that the perpetrator and the victim
    must be in the same place for the offence to be committed.  The phrase in
    any place speaks to the location where the perpetrator exposes himself.  It
    has no grammatical or syntactical connection to the phrase a person who
    is under the age of fourteen years, the phrase describing the victim of
    the offence.  Section 173(2) does not speak to the location of the victim
    when the crime occurs much less require that the victim be in the same place
    as the perpetrator.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    is no need to go beyond the language of s. 173(2) to properly interpret the
    phrase in any place.  The history of s. 173 does, however, explain why
    that phrase appears in s. 173(2).  Section 173(1) creates two crimes, both
    of which require the doing of an indecent act.  The offence described in
    s. 173(1)(a) requires that the act be done in a public place.  The offence
    described in s. 173(1)(b) refers to the indecent act as being committed in
    any place.  The phrase public place is a defined term under s. 150 of
    the <i>Code</i> and has a much more limited meaning than the phrase in any
    place: see <i>R. v. Clark</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The <i>Criminal
      Code</i> has contained the two offences set out in s. 173(1) and distinguished
      between them using phrases like public place and any place since the
      first <i>Criminal Code</i> was enacted in 1892 (S.C. 1892, c. 29, s. 177).  Section
      173(2) came along much later (R.S.C. 1985, c. 19 (3rd Supp.), s. 7(2)).  The
      phrase in any place in s. 173(2) was intended to make it clear that s.
      173(2), like s. 173(1)(b), and unlike s. 173(1)(a), was not limited to
      acts done in a public place or in any particular place. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section
    173(2), like s. 172.1, was enacted to protect children against sexually exploitive
    conduct.  That object is not advanced by an interpretation which requires
    that the victim be in the same physical place as the perpetrator.  The harm
    caused by the prohibited conduct and the danger it poses to young persons
    flows from the conduct and the sexual purpose with which the conduct is done.  Neither
    the harm nor the danger depends upon the victim being in close proximity
    to the perpetrator.  Indeed, it could well be argued that the modern day flasher surfing
    the Internet for vulnerable children poses a more significant risk to children
    than did his old fashioned raincoat clad counterpart standing on some street
    corner.  </p>

    only does the appellants reading of s. 173(2) undermine the object of that
    provision, it would also significantly impair the protection intended to
    be afforded children by s. 172.1(1)(c).  On the appellants interpretation,
    s. 172.1(1)(c) would be helpless to protect children against adults who sexually
    exploit them entirely over the Internet and thereby avoid ever being in the
    same place as their victims.  Instead, the section would reach only those
    adults whose sexually exploitive conduct included some form of intended direct
    contact.  An interpretation which requires direct contact seems entirely
    inconsistent with a provision expressly designed to address sexual exploitation
    via computer communication.  </p>

    do not think that s. 173(2) poses any interpretative difficulty on the facts
    as found by the trial judge.  The appellant was in his home when he exposed
    his genitals via the webcam broadcast to two_tongues13.  Consequently, his
    actions fall squarely within the opening language of s. 173(2).  He was a
    person who, in any place, for a sexual purpose, exposes his or her genital
    organs.  The location of the appellants audience, two_tongues13, was irrelevant
    to his liability under s. 173(2).  It is common ground, of course, that the
    appellant could not be convicted of the full offence under s. 173(2) since,
    despite his best efforts, he did not expose himself to a person under fourteen
    years of age.</p>
  <h2>IV.       SENTENCE APPEAL</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    sentence appeal can be addressed very briefly.  Counsel takes issue with
    one part of the sentence imposed by the trial judge.  He submits that the
    trial judge erred in imposing a custodial sentence and that a conditional
    sentence should have been imposed.  Counsel emphasizes that the appellant
    has no record, did not actually expose himself to a young person, and has
    no history of any sexual interest in children.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    mitigating factors are acknowledged.  However, deterrence and denunciation
    are the primary considerations when sentencing for an offence like the one
    committed here.  A short custodial sentence was appropriate in the circumstances:  see <i>R.
    v. Jarvis</i> (2006), 211 C.C.C. (3d) 20 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>

    term.</p>

    not in force at the time of the appellants trial.  Under the other amendments

    are numerous crimes in the <i>Criminal Code</i> that criminalize otherwise
    non-criminal conduct where it is done with the intention of, or for the purpose
    of committing a crime (e.g. s. 349, entering  a dwelling house with intent
    to commit an indictable offence).  Section 172.1(1)(c) differs from these
    offences in that it does not require that the act be done for the purpose
    of committing one of the designated offences, but instead requires that it
    be done for the purpose of facilitating the commission of one of the enumerated
    offences.  This difference may broaden the reach of s. 172.1(1) compared
    to the reach of these other offences:  see <i>R. v. Legare</i> (2008), 429
    A.R. 271 (C.A.), at paras. 58-66, leave to appeal to S.C.C. granted, 32829
    (December 18, 2008).  I need not address that issue.  The scope to be given
    to the phrase for the purpose of facilitating is not germane to the outcome
    of this case.  There is no doubt that the appellants purpose in communicating
    with two_tongues13 was to facilitate the exposure of his genitals to that
    person.</p>

    ), at p. 282 provides a recent example in which the Court of Appeal affirmed
    a conviction on a charge of attempting to incite a child to engage in sexual
    activity.  The accused thought he was text messaging over his mobile phone
    with a child, but he was in fact texting a police officer posing as a child.  The
    court held that this fact made no difference to the accuseds liability on
    the charge of attempted incitement.    </p>
