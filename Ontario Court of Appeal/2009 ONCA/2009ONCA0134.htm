    the respondents partner on the day in question. The trial judge disbelieved
    the respondent and his partner as well as a number of the other defence witnesses.
    He accepted the facts as outlined below. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    respondent was a court officer with the Toronto Police Service. On March
    4, 2002, he and his partner were transporting four young women in a van from

    Toronto. Because one of the girls was experiencing a medical problem, the
    four girls began banging on the inside of the van to get the two officers attention.
    The respondent first ignored the banging, and then went to the back of the
    van to tell the girls to shut up. He became angry about their behaviour,
    and as punishment, he deliberately drove the van back and forth, stopping
    it suddenly. This caused the girls to fall on the floor and suffer minor
    injuries. </p>

    311 Jarvis Street, the respondent continued to be upset by the girls ongoing
    complaints and their apparent refusal to follow his orders. However, the
    trial judge found that they were not resisting but were trying to complain
    about the respondents behaviour. While they were handcuffed together, he
    pushed them down the stairs and deliberately hit Ms. Hs head into a doorway
    causing a bump on her head. The trial judge found that this was not a restraining
    action. The respondents anger toward Ms. H continued in the cell area where
    he choked her because she continued to talk back to him. She also spit at
    him twice, the second time because he was choking her. </p>

    the sentencing hearing, the Crown sought a sentence of 90 days imprisonment,
    followed by a period of probation. The defence sought a conditional discharge
    or a suspended sentence, but requested that if a term of imprisonment were
    to be imposed, then the sentence should be a conditional sentence or served
    intermittently.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    Crown relied on aggravating factors including breach of trust, the victims
    injuries, and the fact that the respondent and his partner colluded after
    the events to falsify their report of the incident. The defence called many
    witnesses to attest to the respondents good character, his exemplary record,
    and the positive changes in his life. For the purpose of the presentence
    report (of which there were two), the respondent was seen by a psychologist
    who reported several problems including anger. Following the first report,
    the respondent attended an anger management program and was noted in the
    second report to be

    311 Jarvis Street. He then caused charges to be laid against the victim and
    colluded with his partner of the day, a trainee officer, to write a false
    report. He also tried to impede the police investigation that followed. As
    a result, a period of custody was required; in order to properly address
    the sentencing objectives of deterrence and denunciation, a conditional sentence
    was not appropriate. However, in accordance with the defence request, the
    respondent was allowed to serve the 90-day sentence on weekends. A period
    of two years probation was also imposed.</p>

    positive character evidence and presentence report, had undergone counselling,
    had an exemplary record, caused no serious injury to the victim, and had
    suffered serious consequences from his behaviour by losing his job. She also
    found that although his reactions were unjustified, they may have been influenced

    falls into the second category of cases identified in <i>R. v. R.R.</i> (2008),
    90 O.R. (3d) 641 (C.A.) and it is therefore an appropriate case for this

    do not propose to review or to attempt to distinguish these cases. To the
    extent that some trial judges may have taken the approach that a custodial
    sentence is not appropriate where a court officer assaults a prisoner, that
    approach is erroneous. A recent decision of this court from November 2008
    reflects the proper approach in such cases.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R.
      v. Feeney</i>, [2008] O.J. No. 4464 (C.A.) four court officers with the
      Toronto Police Service were convicted of assaulting a prisoner in the holding
      cells of the Old City Hall courthouse. The assault was a vicious revenge
      attack by four officers on a prisoner who had spilled juice on another
      officer. The four defendants also attempted to cover up their involvement,
      which included falsifying reports.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge imposed conditional sentences ranging between 45 and 90 days,
    plus six months probation and 50 hours of community service. This court found
    that the sentences were demonstrably unfit and did not give sufficient weight
    to the principles of deterrence and denunciation. The court emphasized the
    fact that as officers in the justice system, the defendants owed a duty to
    the public. Further, as persons in authority, entrusted with the care of
    persons in their custody, they owed a duty to the victim to take care for
    his safety. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    court stated at para. 6 of the judgment:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>When officers
    entrusted with such duties commit a collective, premeditated, vicious and
    humiliating assault upon a defenceless prisoner, and then try to cover up
    their actions, a sentence emphasizing the principles of deterrence and denunciation
    is called for. We agree with the appellant that the situation was akin to
    a breach of trust which normally calls for a custodial term. Moreover, this
    was a case where the values of our society and its justice system must be
    vindicated and reflected by a sentence that clearly tells those vested with
    power and authority that attacks by court officers on vulnerable prisoners
    will not be tolerated and that when they occur, serious sanctions will be
    imposed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    court also referred to three appellate decisions from
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    British Columbia and
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Nova Scotia: <i>R. v. Bottrell (No.2) </i>(1981), 62 C.C.C. (2d) 45 (B.C.C.A.); <i>R.
    v. Nixon</i> (1991), 63 C.C.C. (3d) 428 (B.C.C.A.); and <i>R. v. Cusack</i> (1978),
    41 C.C.C. (2d) 289 (N.S.S.C. (A.D.)). In those decisions, the appellate courts
    confirmed that cases involving offences by police officers on prisoners in
    their custody require the courts to impose sentences that adequately protect
    society and the victims of police who abuse their power and their position
    of trust.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    determining the appropriate sentence in <i>Feeney</i>, this court observed
    that by the time the appeal was heard, the defendants had served all or virtually
    all of their conditional sentences. Bearing that in mind, the court imposed
    further terms of custody ranging from 30 days to 60 days.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the circumstances are exacerbated by the fact that the victim
    was a teenaged girl. Police and court officers, already in a position of
    trust with prisoners, have an enhanced duty to protect children in their
    custody.</p>

    counsel also referred the court to the case of <i>R. v. Hudd</i> (May 8,
    1998),
    <st1:place

    <st1:City w:st="on">

w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  In <i>Hudd</i>, the defendant bailiff was convicted of assaulting a young
    offender who was being transported with others to a detention centre, following
    a riot at a youth centre. The defendant removed one of the young men from
    the van when they stopped at a gas bar, then kicked him while he was bound
    by flexcuffs and shackles. Determining what occurred in that case was exacerbated,
    as it was in this case, by collusion among court officers. There was also
    collusion among the prisoners.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge imposed a custodial sentence of 60 days to be served on weekends.
    He concluded that because of the breach of trust, a conditional sentence
    would not serve the applicable sentencing principles. This court found the
    sentence to be fit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the summary conviction appeal judge erred by interfering with the
    sentence imposed by the trial judge. In sentencing matters, significant deference
    is owed to trial judges. In this case, the sentence he imposed was well within
    the appropriate range. Furthermore, the sentence that was substituted by
    the summary conviction appeal judge was outside the range and did not adequately
    reflect the principles of deterrence and denunciation that are necessary
    for this type of abuse of authority and breach of trust. I note that as in <i>Feeney</i>,
    not only was there a prolonged assault on a defenceless victim, the respondent
    then attempted to subvert justice by falsifying the evidence and influencing
    another officer to do the same.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    also agree with the Crown that the summary conviction appeal judge erred
    in giving any weight on sentence to whether the respondent was reacting to
    the behaviour of the victim, presumably referring in part to the spitting.
    In <i>Hudd</i>, McGarry J. observed that although the accused in that case
    was in a very stressful situation,  he was trained as a bailiff to deal with
    that type of situation and would fully understand that he was in a position
    of trust and that kicking an inmate would be a very serious criminal violation.</p>
