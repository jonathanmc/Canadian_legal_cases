    issue on this appeal is whether the motion judge erred in refusing to grant
    a stay on account of arbitration and forum selection clauses in one of the
    contracts entered into by the respondents “Dancap” and the appellants “Key
    Brand”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dancap
    and Key Brand executed a preliminary Term Sheet outlining the general terms
    of a participation agreement related to Key Brand’s acquisition of theatrical
    assets, including two
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Toronto theatres. Dancap was to obtain an equity position in Key Brand and
    membership on its board, as well as the right to manage the theatres pursuant
    to separate management agreements to be concluded in the future.  The parties
    also entered into an Additional Rights Agreement (“ARA”) which, among other
    things, set out the parties’ agreement to negotiate in good faith towards
    the conclusion of the management agreements. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    ARA contains an arbitration clause requiring that “[a]ny dispute, controversy
    or claim arising out of or relating to” the agreement (except for equitable
    claims) be submitted to arbitration.  The ARA also contains a forum selection
    clause providing for the exclusive jurisdiction of the state or
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>
    District courts in
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    California.  The Term Sheet does not contain arbitration or forum selection
    clauses.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    the acquisition of the assets by Key Brand and prior to the finalization
    of the management agreements, Key Brand sold the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto theatres to the respondent Mirvish Enterprises Limited (“Mirvish”).
    Dancap, insisting that its claims arose under the Term Sheet and not the
    ARA, commenced this action for damages and injunctive relief in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario.  Key Brand, insisting that a significant part of Dancap’s claims
    were subject to the ARA arbitration and forum selection clauses, moved to
    stay the action. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge dismissed Key Brand’s motion. He ruled that Dancap’s claims
    arose solely under the Term Sheet and not under the ARA and that the ARA
    arbitration and forum selection clauses did not apply.  Subsequent to that
    decision, Key Brand obtained an order from the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h4>

    the parties are incorporated under different laws and have their places of
    business in various jurisdictions, for convenience I will refer to all of
    the Key Brand entities collectively as “Key Brand” and all of the Dancap
    entities collectively as “Dancap”.  Key Brand has its principal place of
    business in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    New York while Dancap is headquartered in
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    September 2007, Key Brand successfully bid for certain North American theatrical
    assets owned by Live Nation Inc. (the “Live Nation Assets”).  The Live Nation
    Assets included the Canon Theatre and the Panasonic Theatre in Toronto as
    well as a Canadian touring business called Broadway Across Canada (collectively,
    the
    “Canadian Assets”). </p>
  <h3><i>The Term Sheet</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    Term Sheet was executed in early November 2007 to document the essential
    terms of the transaction.  Pursuant to the Term Sheet, Dancap was to acquire
    an equity interest in Key Brand, representation on the Key Brand board of
    directors and the right to manage the Canadian Assets.  The Term Sheet provides
    that it shall bind the parties until long form agreements, including Management
    Agreements with respect to the Canadian Assets, have been entered into. Under
    the heading
    “Canadian Operations”, the Term Sheet provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Dancap Productions will manage the Canadian Assets
    pursuant to the Dancap Management Agreements.  This agreement [sic] will
    contain terms customary in such agreements, including without limitation,
    customary representations and warranties, mutual indemnities and other provisions
    consistent with normal business practices in the Theatre industry. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Term Sheet goes on to specify certain terms to be contained in the Management
    Agreements, including termination clauses giving either party the right to
    terminate the Management Agreements on certain grounds and with six months’ notice.
    The Term Sheet is silent on the subject of arbitration and forum selection. </p>
  <h3><i>The ARA and the Shareholders’
    Agreement</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Prior
    to the closing of the Live Nation transaction, Key Brand and Dancap negotiated
    and entered into a Shareholders’ Agreement, the ARA and a Subscription Agreement,
    all of which were executed in late December, 2007.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    ARA is an adjunct to the Shareholders’ Agreement and deals with certain rights
    unique to Dancap.  It refers in several places to the “Management Agreements”,
    defined to include agreements for the management of the Canadian Assets.  The
    following clause was added to the ARA at Dancap’s request:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>9. MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS.  [Dancap] and Key Brand
    intend to the enter into Management Agreements in accordance with the terms
    of the Term Sheet dated November 7, 2007 among the parties hereto and [Dancap]
    and Key Brand will continue to negotiate in good faith towards executing
    Management Agreements which have terms consistent with the terms set forth
    in such Term Sheet.  The Management Agreements shall include a right of Key
    Brand to terminate the Management Agreements if [Dancap] ceases to own any
    common stock of Key Brand.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    ARA contains an “entire agreement” clause providing that it “supersedes all
    prior agreements, negotiations and understandings concerning the subject
    matter hereof” and that it “shall supplement each of the Management Agreements
    and the Shareholders Agreement of even date”.  The entire agreement clause
    further provides that “if there is a conflict between this Agreement and… the
    Management Agreements, this Agreement shall control and provide [Dancap]
    with the additional rights granted… under this Agreement.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    ARA provides that the governing law is to be the law of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    California and also contains the forum selection and arbitration clauses
    that are the focus of this appeal. Section 15(i) provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><u>Jurisdiction</u>.  Subject only to the arbitration
    provisions of this Agreement, the parties hereto hereby irrevocably submit
    to the exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts of the State of California
    in Los Angeles County or the United States District Court for the Central
    District of California, for the purposes of any lawsuit, action or other
    proceeding arising out of or based upon this Agreement and the subject matter
    hereof.  The parties hereto, to the greatest extent permitted by applicable
    law, hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waive, and agree not to assert,
    by way of motion, as a defence, or otherwise, in any such lawsuit, action
    or other proceeding brought in the above-named courts or as provided in the
    arbitration provisions of this Agreement, any claim that is not subject personally
    to the jurisdiction of such courts or arbitration tribunal, that its property
    is exempt or immune from attachment or execution, that the lawsuit, action
    or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum, that the venue of the
    lawsuit, action or proceeding is improper or that this Agreement may not
    be enforced in or by such court or tribunal....</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    15(j) provides: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><u>Arbitration</u>.  Any dispute, controversy or
    claim arising out of or relating to this Agreement (other than claims for
    injunctive or equitable relief), including, but not limited to, the interpretation,
    breach or termination thereof (including whether the claims asserted are
    arbitrable), shall be referred to and finally determined by arbitration in
    accordance with the JAMS International Arbitration Rules.  The tribunal will
    consist of a sole arbitrator.  The place of arbitration shall be
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Los Angeles,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    California.  The language to be used in the arbitral proceedings will be
    the English language.  The arbitrator may, in the award, allocate all or
    part of the costs of the arbitration, including the fees of the arbitrator,
    and fees and costs of the prevailing party. Judgement upon the award rendered
    by the arbitrator may be entered by any court having jurisdiction thereof. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Shareholders’ Agreement contains parallel arbitration and choice of law clauses.</p>
  <h3><i>Sale of Theatres to Mirvish and Dancap’s Action</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Key
    Brand closed the acquisition of the Live Nation Assets on January 23, 2008.
    Shortly thereafter and prior to the finalization of the Management Agreements
    between Key Brand and Dancap, Key Brand entered into negotiations with Mirvish
    for the sale of the Canon and Panasonic theatres.  Key Brand and Mirvish
    concluded an agreement of purchase and sale on April 8, 2008. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dancap
    immediately threatened proceedings, taking the position that by agreeing
    to sell the theatres to Mirvish, Key Brand had violated Dancap’s contractual
    right to manage the Canadian Assets.  On April 11, 2008, Key Brand filed
    a petition in the United States District Court in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    California for an order to compel Dancap to submit their dispute to arbitration.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
class=headingNUMBERChar>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Less
    than a month later, Dancap commenced this action.
     <span class=headingNUMBERChar>The statement of claim names both Key Brand
    and Mirvish as defendants.  Key Brand asserts claims for damages for breach
    of contract, conspiracy under the <i>Competition Act</i>, breach of the duty
    of good faith contractual performance, constructive trust, unjust enrichment,
    fraudulent misrepresentation, breach of trust, interference with economic
    relations and inducing breach of contract. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=headingNUMBERChar>Dancap
      also sought injunctive relief to prevent the completion of the Mirvish</span> transaction
      and specific performance of the Term Sheet.</p>
  <h3><i>The Decision of the Motion Judge</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dancap’s
    motion for an interlocutory injunction to prevent the Mirvish sale and Key
    Brand’s motion for a stay were heard together.
     The motion judge dismissed both motions on August 15, 2008.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge found that while Dancap had not shown a serious issue to be
    tried with respect to its right to prevent the sale to Mirvish, it had shown
    a serious issue to be tried in respect of Key Brand’s termination of Dancap’s
    rights to manage the Canadian Assets.  However, he found that Dancap had
    failed to establish that it would suffer irreparable harm if left to its
    remedy in damages.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge dismissed Key Brand’s motion for a stay on the grounds that
    the ARA did not address the issue of termination of management rights in
    the event of a sale and that the dispute between the parties related solely
    to the Term Sheet.  He held as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Term Sheet is the starting point for this claim.  The
    Term Sheet had not been superceded by the ARA or the [Shareholders Agreement]

    September 9, 2008, the District Court issued an order requiring the parties
    to submit to arbitration the issue of whether Key Brand had the right to
    terminate Dancap’s right to manage the Canon and Panasonic theatres upon
    their sale.  In reaching this conclusion, the District Court judge took into
    account the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario litigation as well as the motion judge’s refusal to grant an interlocutory

    Ontario action involved additional parties and claims brought under Canadian
    law.  He held that there was no support for Key Brand’s request to have all
    of the claims advanced by Dancap in the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario action arbitrated.  However, he accepted Key Brand’s position that
    it was appropriate to compel arbitration on the issue of whether, as Key
    Brand put it:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[Key Brand] “has the right to terminate any management
    rights to the Theatres that Dancap may have obtained under the agreements

    was dismissed in part and allowed in part.  The District Court judge specified
    that the word “agreements” should be changed to “Agreements” and should be
    read to include both the Term Sheet and the ARA.  He also stated that the
    only claims that he intended to exclude from his order were the claims against

  <h3>1.         <i>The Arbitration Clause</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Key
    Brand’s request for a stay rests upon art. 8(1) of the UNCITRAL Model Law
    on International Commercial Arbitration, adopted in Ontario by the<i> International
    Commercial Arbitration Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. I-9:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A court before which an action is brought in a
    matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement shall, if a party
    so requests not later than when submitting his first statement on the substance
    of the dispute, refer the parties to arbitration unless it finds that the
    agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Article
    8(1) must be read in conjunction with art. 16(1), which provides in part: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The arbitral tribunal may rule on its own jurisdiction,
    including any objections with respect to the existence or validity of the
    arbitration agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    outlined above, s. 15(j) of the ARA provides, in harmony with art. 16 of
    the Model Law, that the arbitrator has the authority to determine “whether
    the claims asserted are arbitrable”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is now well-established in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario that the court should grant a stay under art. 8(1) of the
    Model Law where it is “arguable” that the dispute falls within the terms
    of an arbitration agreement. In <i>Dalimpex Ltd. v. Janicki</i> (2003), 64
    O.R. (3d) 737 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), at para. 21, Charron J.A. adopted the following passage by Hinkson J.A.
    in <i>Gulf Canada Resources Ltd. v. Arochem International Ltd.</i> (1992),
    66 B.C.L.R. (2d) 113 (B.C.C.A.), at paras. 39-40, as “the proper approach” to
    art. 8(1):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>it is not for the court on an application for a
    stay of proceedings to reach any final determination as to the scope of the
    arbitration agreement or whether a particular party to the legal proceedings
    is a party to the arbitration agreement because those are matters within
    the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal.  Only where it is clear that the
    dispute is outside the terms of the arbitration agreement or that a party
    is not a party to the arbitration agreement or that the application is out
    of time should the court reach any final determination in respect of such
    matters on an application for a stay of proceedings.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Where it is arguable that the dispute falls within
    the terms of the arbitration agreement or where it is arguable that a party
    to the legal proceedings is a party to the arbitration agreement then, in
    my view, the stay should be granted and those matters left to be determined
    by the arbitral tribunal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    Charron J.A. explained in <i>Dalimpex</i>, at para. 22, “a deferential approach” allowing
    the arbitrator to decide whether the dispute is arbitrable, absent a clear
    case to the contrary, “is consistent both with the wording of the legislation
    and the intention of the parties to review their disputes to arbitration.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More
    recently, in <i>Dell Computer Corp. v. Union des consommateurs</i>, [2007]
    2 S.C.R. 801, after a review of international and Quebec jurisprudence as
    well as scholarly writing on the Model Law, the Supreme Court of Canada endorsed
    the “competence-competence” principle that calls for deference to arbitrators
    to resolve challenges to their jurisdiction.  At para. 84, Deschamps J. laid
    down a “general rule that in any case involving an arbitration clause, a
    challenge to the arbitrator’s jurisdiction must be resolved first by the
    arbitrator.” She added, at para. 85, that “[i]f the challenge requires the
    production and review of factual evidence, the court should normally refer
    the case to arbitration”
    unless the question of fact or mixed fact and law requires “only superficial
    consideration of the documentary evidence in the record.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Neither
    the motion judge nor the District Court judge appears to have taken the approach
    mandated by <i>Dalimpex</i> and <i>Dell</i>.  Both assumed jurisdiction to
    decide the scope of the arbitration clause themselves.  The motion judge
    confronted the issue of whether the dispute fell within the ambit of the
    arbitration clause in the ARA and found that it did not.  The District Court
    Judge undertook the same inquiry and concluded that it did. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    may well be that in the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>
    , courts do not follow the deferential approach to arbitrability set out
    in <i>Dalimpex</i> and <i>Dell</i>.  (I note, however, that in the statement
    of defence Dancap has filed in the arbitration, Dancap maintains that Key
    Brand’s claims are not arbitrable and reserves the right to argue the point
    before the arbitrator as well as before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals.)</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whatever
    the law may be in the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>
    , I am persuaded that the motion judge erred in ruling on the scope of the
    arbitration clause rather than leaving the issue to the arbitrator.<i>  </i>While
    the issue of whether the dispute between the parties is covered by the ARA
    is by no means free from doubt, for the reasons that follow, I conclude that
    it is at least arguable that the ARA arbitration clause governs the core
    issue raised in the action.  That issue was properly identified by the District
    Court judge as being whether Key Brand has the right to terminate any management
    rights to the theatres that Dancap may have obtained under either the Term
    Sheet or the ARA upon the sale of the theatres to Mirvish. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    turn first to the scope of the arbitration clause. Section 15(j) of the ARA
    is broad in scope: it applies not only to disputes arising
    “out of” the ARA but also to disputes “related to” the ARA.  Contractual
    language calling for the arbitration of disputes “relating to” an agreement
    have been generously interpreted to enjoy “a wide compass”, an interpretation “consistent
    with the legislative policy… which favours arbitration over litigation where
    the parties so provide by agreement”: <i>Woolcock v. Bushert</i> (2004),
    246 D.L.R. (4th) 139 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), at paras. 23, 25. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is arguable that Dancap’s claim is “related to” the ARA.  Although the management
    agreements were never finalized in written form, Dancap’s right to manage
    the Canadian Assets was an underlying feature of the bargain between the
    parties as memorialized in the Term Sheet.  As the motion judge recognized,
    s. 9 of the ARA does at least to some extent “document certain management
    rights in issue” in the action. Section 9 carries forward the parties’
    undertaking to “continue to negotiate in good faith towards executing Management
    Agreements which will have terms consistent with the terms set forth in [the]
    Term Sheet.”  Especially when read with the “entire agreement” clause, which
    also refers to the Management Agreements, it is arguable that s. 9 of the
    ARA embraced or incorporated Dancap’s management rights as they stood at
    the time the ARA was executed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, this is not a case where it is clear or obvious that the dispute
    between the parties is not governed by the arbitration clause.  The determination
    of the scope of the ARA and the arbitration clause will require a thorough
    review of the parties’ complex contractual discussions, understandings, expectations
    and arrangements, an inquiry that clearly calls for much more than a “superficial
    consideration of the documentary evidence in the record.”  I conclude, therefore,
    that on this record, the motion judge erred in refusing to stay Dancap’s
    action on account of the arbitration clause. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    one takes into account the District Court’s decision to refer the matter
    to arbitration – which was not before the motion judge at the time he rendered
    his decision – the case for a stay of the
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario action is even more compelling.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is apparent that as matters now stand, subject to Dancap’s appeal of the
    District Court order, the matter has been referred to an arbitrator in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    California.  Both as a practical matter and as a matter of law, costly parallel
    proceedings that run the risk of inconsistent results are to be avoided:
    see <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c C.43, s. 138.  As matters
    presently stand, it is difficult to see how any order other than a stay of
    the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario action could avoid duplicative proceedings. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    it is my view that this action should be stayed until the resolution of the
    arbitration on the core issue of whether Key Brand has the right to terminate
    any management rights to the theatres that Dancap may have obtained under
    either the Term Sheet or the ARA upon the sale of the theatres.</p>
  <h3>2.         <i>The Forum Selection Clause</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    oral argument before this court, Key Brand fairly conceded, as the District
    Court judge recognized, that not all of the claims pleaded by Dancap are
    subject to arbitration or to the jurisdiction of the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    California courts.  In particular, Key Brand conceded that the claims advanced
    against Mirvish, the non-contractual claims and the conspiracy claim under
    the <i>Competition Act</i> all fall outside the reach of the arbitration
    clause and that if they proceed following the arbitration, they should be
    litigated in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    the position taken by Key Brand and the conclusion I have reached with respect
    to the arbitration issue, it is not necessary for me to consider the application
    of the forum selection clause to the circumstances of this case. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
