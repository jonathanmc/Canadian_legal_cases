style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    applicant, a Canadian citizen, is the subject of an extradition request from
    the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">
    Republic of
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    France.  He has been on bail without incident since November 30, 2001.  The
    applicant was ordered committed for surrender in January 2007 and the Minister
    ordered him surrendered in January 2008.  An appeal from the committal order
    and a judicial review of the surrender order were dismissed by a unanimous
    decision of this court released on January 23, 2009.  The applicant has applied
    for leave to appeal from that decision in the Supreme Court of Canada.  Best
    estimates are that the leave application will be determined some time in
    the next six months.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    applicant applies for bail pending the proceedings in the Supreme Court of
    Canada.  That application is governed by the criteria set out in s. 679(3)
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  The applicant must demonstrate that the application
    for leave to appeal is not frivolous, that he will surrender himself into
    custody in accordance with the terms of any release order, and that his detention
    is not necessary in the public interest.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown submits that the applicant has failed to demonstrate that his application
    for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada is not frivolous.  It
    is difficult for a judge of one court to make an informed assessment of the
    possibility of leave to appeal being granted by another court.  Some cases
    are obvious candidates for leave, as for example, where the decision from
    which leave is sought is inconsistent with the decision of another provincial
    appellate court.  That is not this case.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Leave
    to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada is of necessity granted sparingly.  Leave
    will be refused in the vast majority of cases.  The appellant has raised
    an arguable question of law in his application, however, more than that is
    needed to obtain leave:  see <i>Supreme Court Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. S-26,
    s. 40, Sopinka, Gelowitz “The Conduct of an Appeal”, (Butterworths 1993)
    at pp. 165-172.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Norris argues that this application raises the same issue on which leave
    to appeal was recently granted in <i>R. v. Fischbacher</i> (2008), 235 C.C.C.
    (3d) 45 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  This court’s decision in this case does refer to a line of authority
    relied on in <i>Fischbacher</i>, <i>supra</i>.  There are similarities in
    the legal issue raised on this appeal and the issue decided in <i>Fischbacher</i>.  There
    are also significant differences in the two cases.  The fact that leave to
    appeal has been granted in <i>Fischbacher</i> may give Mr. Norris a “leg
    up” on his application for leave to appeal in this case.  I cannot say, however,
    how strong that “leg” may be.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    find myself in this position.  I cannot say that the applicant has no realistic
    chance of obtaining leave to appeal.  However, beyond that, I cannot quantify
    his chances of obtaining leave to appeal.  I propose to address the other
    two criteria relevant to bail and then to return to the argument that the
    application is not frivolous.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent does not argue that the applicant has failed to demonstrate that
    he will surrender into custody in accordance with the terms of any release
    order.  He is a Canadian citizen and has been on bail for seven and a half
    years.  He has complied with the terms of his bail, including the various
    surrender orders. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent does submit that the applicant has failed to demonstrate that
    his detention is not necessary in the public interest.  The respondent argues
    that the applicant has been ordered surrendered in connection with terrorism-related
    offences.  She argues that
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    , as a responsible member of the international community, must be seen as
    co-operating fully with other countries who seek to root out and prosecute
    those involved in terrorist activities.  As I understand this argument, the
    respondent submits that the applicant’s continued release on bail would somehow
    suggest that
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    does not take these matters as seriously as it should.  Counsel relies on
    the well known passages from the majority judgment of LaForest J. in <i>United
    States of America v. Cotroni</i>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1469 at paras. 28-29 in
    which he stressed the importance of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    ’s responsibilities to co-operate in the effective prosecution of international
    crime in an ever shrinking world.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    accept the validity of the comment made in <i>Cotroni</i>.  That observation
    seems to me, however, to speak more to the need for an effective and expeditious
    extradition process than to the question of whether the target of that process
    should be in or out of custody while the process runs its course.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    is nothing in the record filed on this application, apart from the allegations
    made by the French authorities, to suggest that the applicant, if released,
    will commit crimes in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    or elsewhere, or otherwise engage in any unlawful or dangerous activity.  The
    applicant’s track record during the many years that he has been on bail suggests
    to the contrary.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Nor,
    as with a person who has been through the domestic criminal process, is the
    applicant under any sentence.  No court in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    has determined that the applicant has committed an offence and should be
    incarcerated:  see <i>Schreiber v.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Germany</st1:country-region>
    (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Federal
    <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">
    Republic)</i> (2007), ONCA 80 at paras. 9-10 (per Lang J.A. in chambers).  The
    conviction entered against the applicant in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">France</st1:country-region>
    was entered in his absence and, apparently, without notice to him.  According
    to the material, the authorities in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">France</st1:country-region>
    agree that the conviction will be set aside upon the applicant’s return to
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      France</st1:country-region>
    and he will be entitled to a trial on the merits.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    addressing the public interest, it is important to understand the purpose
    for which the applicant is in custody in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  The only reason
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    has any cause to place him in custody is to facilitate his surrender to
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      France</st1:country-region>
    .  The applicant will not be surrendered while his application for leave
    to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada is outstanding.  It cannot be said
    to be in the public interest to hold the applicant in custody to facilitate
    his surrender when his surrender will not take place before the application
    for leave is decided.  Absent some substantive cause specific to the applicant
    to justify detention, the public interest considered in the context of an
    extradition proceeding is not served by incarceration that does not facilitate
    the applicant’s surrender to the requesting country.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Having
    concluded that the applicant will surrender himself as required and that
    his detention is not necessary in the public interest, I return to the question
    of whether his application for leave to appeal is “not frivolous”.  Where
    the applicant has met the substantive considerations relating to bail by
    demonstrating that he is not a flight risk and that the public interest does
    not require his incarceration, recognition of the legitimate liberty interests
    at stake justifies setting a low bar when determining whether the applicant
    has shown that his application for leave to appeal is not frivolous.  I do
    not think that an applicant who has shown himself otherwise entitled to bail
    should be held in custody based on my speculative and somewhat uninformed
    assessment of the likelihood of the applicant obtaining leave to appeal.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    application raises a viable question of law and there is some basis to think
    that the legal question could warrant leave to appeal to the Supreme Court
    of Canada.  That is enough to satisfy me that this application is “not frivolous”.  I
    stress, however, that where legitimate public interest concerns are raised
    in connection with the applicant’s release, a harder look at the merits of
    the application will be justified in the context of considering the public
    interest criterion.    </p>
