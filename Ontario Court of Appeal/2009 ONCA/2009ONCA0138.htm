    appellant is the complainants father.  He was convicted of one count of
    sexual assault, one count of sexual touching and one count of incest.  The

    for the appellant argues that various statements made by the trial judge
    throughout the trial, in her reasons for judgment and in her reasons for
    sentence, when considered cumulatively, create the impression that the trial
    judge allowed sympathy for the complainant to impact on her verdict.  Counsel
    submits that the trial judges comments, at a minimum, create a reasonable
    apprehension that the trial judge was predisposed to favour the complainant
    and to reject the appellants contention that the complainant was fabricating
    her allegations in concert with her mother to gain revenge on the appellant
    for his having ignored the complainant and her mother throughout the complainants
    life.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    agree with counsel that the comments must be considered cumulatively and
    that the entire trial record must be examined and the comments placed in
    their proper context.  We reject counsels submissions in respect of the
    proceedings prior to the verdict.  We do not see anything done during the
    trial itself that could reasonably suggest any predisposition to favour the
    complainant.  The trial judges conduct of the trial was even-handed throughout
    the hearing of the evidence and the taking of the submissions from counsel.  Her
    interventions during cross-examination were few in number, reasonable, made
    in temperate language and did not in any way limit the conduct of the defence.  The
    worst that can be said is that one or two of the interventions may have been
    unnecessary and that one comment made by the trial judge at the end of a
    lengthy cross-examination of the complainant,  she referred to the counsel
    as badgering the witness  may have been somewhat harsh.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    also see no merit in the submission that the trial judges ruling when he
    allowed defence counsel to further cross-examine the complainant after an
    amendment to the indictment displayed a predisposition in favour of the complainant.  The
    trial judge was properly concerned that the further cross-examination should
    be limited to the areas brought into controversy by the amendment of the
    indictment.  The cross-examination had already been lengthy and the trial
    judge wanted to keep proper limits on the further cross-examination.  The
    trial judge, as we read the record, told defence counsel to advise the Crown
    of the areas in which she proposed to conduct further cross-examination before
    the cross-examination started. The trial judge did this so that the Crown
    could advance any objections it might have before the witness was on the
    stand.  This procedure would avoid further fracturing of the cross-examination
    of the witness that would have occurred had objections been made on a question-by-question
    basis.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    see nothing unreasonable in the procedure followed by the trial judge to
    ensure that the further cross-examination stayed within appropriate bounds.  The
    procedure seemed to work.  Defence counsel conducted a further cross-examination
    that was not improperly curtailed or limited in any way.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    brings us to the trial judges reasons for judgment, the aspect of the trial
    that raises concerns.  There are two passages in the trial judges reasons
    that could be taken as indicating that the complainant was cruelly and unfairly
    treated in the course of the trial because defence counsel vigorously cross-examined
    her in an effort to show that she was fabricating her story.  Counsel for
    the appellant contends that there was nothing improper in the cross-examination.  He
    submits that the trial judges mischaracterization of that cross-examination
    reflects a sympathy for the complainant, that may well have factored into
    the trial judges assessment of the case.  Counsel submits that the reasons
    of the trial judge could reasonably be read as an abandonment of the presumption
    of innocence in favour of a presumption favouring the complainants evidence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>These
    passages are troubling.  For example, in reference to the complainants reaction
    to her cross-examination, the trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>She did, however,
    endure it unshaken and <u>the cruel suggestions that the allegations were
    concocted for revenge were never supported by one scintilla of evidence.</u>  Further,
    [the complainant] basically had to endure it alone.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    is nothing unfair or abusive in conducting a probing, vigorous and challenging
    cross-examination, even where the witness is a child complainant.  Counsels  duty
    to her or his client will sometimes require nothing less.  In this case,
    the defence claimed that the complainant was lying.  She had to be attacked
    in cross-examination.  We see no basis in the record to support the assertion
    that the conduct of the defence was in any way improper or abusive of the
    complainant.  That, of course, is not to say that the trial process was not
    a very difficult one for the complainant.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    two impugned comments made by the trial judge must, however, be placed in
    the context of the entirety of her reasons and her conduct of the trial.  As
    we have already said, the trial judge conducted the trial in an entirely
    proper manner.  In her reasons, the trial judge reviewed the evidence in
    a detailed and accurate manner. She carefully analyzed that evidence and
    considered in detail each of the three prongs of the position advanced by
    the defence.  The trial judges examination of the complainants credibility
    and the reliability of her evidence was thorough and accurately reflects
    the record.  The trial judge alerted herself to the presumption of innocence.  She
    properly reminded herself of the principles in <i>R. v. W.(D.)</i>.  Finally,
    she made it clear that she should not, and would not, infer guilt from the
    appellants failure to assume any of the responsibilities that he should
    have taken on as the father of the complainant.  </p>

    the troubling comments are considered in this context, we think the trial
    judge must have been describing the impact of the cross-examination on the
    complainant.  While some of the wording may be unfortunate, we take the trial
    judge as in effect acknowledging in the course of assessing the complainants
    evidence that some of the questions put to her were very painful to answer
    and to her would seem cruel and abusive.  Viewed in that light, those comments
    do not suggest any predisposition in favour of the complainant.  </p>

    also refers to certain comments made with respect to the complainant in the
    reasons for sentence.  Post-conviction, we see nothing wrong with the trial
    judge empathizing with the victim and recognizing and addressing the pain
    that the victim has suffered, not only as a result of the offences, but also
    by virtue of having to proceed through the difficulties of the criminal process.  We
    take nothing from the reasons for sentence that would suggest a bias in favour
    of the complainant prior to conviction.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant also argued that an amendment to the indictment made by the trial
    judge at the end of the Crowns case was improper.  The amendment changed
    the dates between which the offences were alleged to have occurred and was
    based on the complainants evidence.  We agree with the trial judge that
    there was no prejudice established.  The trial judge referred to the possibility
    of prejudice and indicated that she could revisit her ruling should any such
    prejudice develop.  None did.  The amendment was properly made under s. 601
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Concerning
    sentence, the appellants primary submission is that the trial judge erred
    in principle by treating the appellants lack of remorse as an aggravating
    factor and by declining to consider a conditional sentence for that reason.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    disagree.  Although the trial judge referred at one point in her reasons
    to the increased impact on the complainant because she was put through a
    trial and stated that she might have considered a conditional sentence had
    there been any sign of regret or remorse, read fairly, we do not interpret
    her reasons as treating lack of remorse as an aggravating factor.  The trial
    judge stated specifically that exercising the right to a trial is not an
    aggravating factor.  Further, she recognized correctly that the proper range
    of sentence for these offences is three to five years.  In our view, the
    impugned passages do no more than recognize that the appellant was not entitled
    to the significant mitigation that may have arisen from a guilty plea and
    associated expressions of remorse.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant also claims that the sentence imposed is unfit having regard to
    other mitigating factors that are present.  In particular, his significant
    health issues which include end stage renal disease, high blood pressure
    and sleep apnea.  We reject this submission.  The trial judge carefully considered
    the appellants circumstances, including his health issues.  There was no
    evidence at trial or before us to indicate that the appellants health concerns
    cannot be addressed in the penitentiary.  Accordingly, leave to appeal sentence
    is granted but the sentence appeal is dismissed.</p>
