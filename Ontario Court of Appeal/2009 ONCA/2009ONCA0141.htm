    <st1:address w:st="on">
    1988 Chrysler 5<sup>th</sup> Avenue, from her father-in-law. After some repairs
    had been completed, the appellant’s father took the car to a licensed mechanic
    for a safety check. The mechanic certified the vehicle as compliant with
    provincial safety standards and it was licensed.</span></p>

      to lock-up and it would make it more difficult to bring the vehicle to
      a stop by applying the brakes. Some wheels could slow down more quickly

      August 20, 2003, around 3:00 p.m., Robert Smart was riding his bicycle
      on the shoulder of
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Catering Road, a narrow, two-lane road with a posted speed limit of 50km
    per hour. The gravel shoulders are about 2 or 3 feet wide. There are houses,
    a trailer park and a high school in the immediate area, as well as a sharp
    curve within sight of the scene of the collision. A local resident testified
    that the curve could be negotiated at the posted speed limit but not at speeds
    in excess of 80km per hour.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Craig

    at the posted speed limit of 50km per hour. He noticed a cyclist on the shoulder

      appellant pulled out to pass Carter’s vehicle and accelerated to speeds
      more than twice the posted speed limit to do so. Carter pulled away from
      the shoulder to ensure that he didn’t strike the cyclist. To avoid striking
      Carter’s Jeep as it moved into the opposite lane, the appellant braked.
      His right side brakes locked, but there was little braking from the opposite
      side. The imbalance caused the Chrysler to rotate as it braked. The vehicle
      came back across the lane in which it had been originally travelling, struck
      the cyclist at the edge of the road and continued a rotating slide over
      a driveway, off the road and into a tree.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>The Causation Issue</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Two
      paragraphs in the reasons of the trial judge reflect his assessment of
      the relationship between the condition of the motor vehicle and the manner
      in which the appellant operated it as contributing factors in the death
      of the deceased: </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>67. I agree with the Crown that
      the unsafe condition of the Chrysler was shown to be a significant contributing
      cause to the manner in which this collision occurred. However, the fact
      that a licensed mechanic had certified the car to be safe the previous
      month I find substantially detracts from the Crown’s submission that Mr.
      K.L. jr. knew the vehicle was unsafe to drive and nevertheless chose to
      drive with disregard for public safety. Of course, the safety certification
      process is meant to protect the public from this very circumstance.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'><span
lang=EN-US>…</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>76. I agree with the defence that
      on the evidence before me, those who knew of this vehicle’s condition and
      allowed it to be licensed and operated played a direct role in the death
      of Mr. Smart. Having acknowledged that, there is no doubt that the tragic
      chain of events that led to the death of Mr. Smart began with the dangerous
      actions of K.L. I find that the acts of the accused K.L. were a significant
      contributing cause to the death of Robert Smart.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>The Alleged Error</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant contends that causation has both a factual and a legal component.
    Factual causation involves an inquiry about how a deceased died in a medical,
    mechanical or physical sense. Legal causation, on the other hand, has to
    do with whether the person who is alleged to have caused death should be
    held responsible in law for that death.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Filipovic acknowledges that the <i>factual</i> causation component has been
    established here. He submits, however, that the <i>legal</i> component has
    not been established. The trial judge applied a
    “but for” test to the legal component of causation. However appropriate a “but
    for” test may be for the factual component of causation, it does not apply
    to the legal component. In this case, the legal component was not established. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant contends that the legal component of causation, which looks to
    who should be held legally responsible for the cyclist’s death, points to
    the mechanic who certified the car as fit. It was the mechanic’s act of certification
    and the intervening and inevitable brake failure that severed the appellant’s
    causal connection, thus legal responsibility for the cyclist’s death. </p>
  <h3>Discussion</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    causation standard in vehicular crimes involving consequential death is the
    same standard as applies in cases of unlawful homicide, whether charged as
    murder or manslaughter. That standard requires that the accused’s conduct
    be at least a contributing cause of the deceased’s death, outside the <i>de
    minimis </i>range: <i>R. v. Smithers</i>, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 506 at p. 519; <i>R.
    v. Nette</i>, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 488 at paras. 71 and 72.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    criminal law does not recognize contributory negligence nor is it equipped
    with any mechanism to apportion responsibility for the harm occasioned by
    criminal conduct, except as part of sentencing after the required standard
    of causation has been established: <i>Nette </i>at para. 49.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the task of the trial judge was not to determine, as between the
    reckless mechanic and the dangerous driver, who was more responsible for
    the death of the deceased. What the trial judge was required to decide and
    did determine was whether the appellant’s conduct was at least a contributing
    cause of the deceased’s death outside the <i>de minimus </i>range. Provided
    the appellant’s operation of the car was at least a contributing cause of
    death, outside the <i>de minimis </i>range, the prosecutor need establish
    no more to satisfy the causation requirement. It is as immaterial here that
    death was in part caused by a defective braking system as it was in <i>Smithers </i>that
    death was in part caused by a malfunctioning epiglottis.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is worth remembering that, as in <i>Smithers</i>, the offences charged here
    impose no burden on the prosecution to prove an intention to cause death
    or even injury. Nor was foreseeability of death or injury in issue. That
    the fatality was unanticipated or an unlikely result of the appellant’s conduct
    is not a defence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant acknowledges that the manner in which he drove the Chrysler constituted
    dangerous operation of a motor vehicle. There was no intervening act to break
    the chain of causation between the appellant’s conduct and the prohibited

    month earlier. Nor did the braking malfunction sever the causation connection
    when it was the manner in which the appellant operated the vehicle that created
    the necessity of braking. </p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>76. I agree with the defence that
      on the evidence before me, those who knew of this vehicle’s condition and
      allowed it to be licensed and operated played a direct role in the death
      of Mr. Smart. Having acknowledged that, there is no doubt that the tragic
      chain of events that led to the death of Mr. Smart began with the dangerous
      actions of K.L. I find that the acts of the accused K.L. were a significant
      contributing case to the death of Robert Smart.</span></p>

    appellant’s principal complaint about the trial judge’s reasons on causation
    is that the trial judge failed to explain why the mechanic’s reckless certification
    of the safety of the vehicle did not break the chain of causation and relieve
    the appellant of liability for causing the death of the deceased. The absence
    of analysis leaves the legal causation requirement proven on a “but for” basis
    which, however appropriate per factual causation, is simply wrong for legal
    causation.</p>

    appellant was charged with counts of criminal negligence causing death and
    dangerous operation of a motor vehicle causing death. The principal focus
    of the trial was on the manner of the appellant’s driving, including his
    knowledge of the mechanical condition of the car, which the prosecutor sought
    to prove as a basis upon which to establish criminal negligence. That said,
    causation was nonetheless an essential element of the prosecutor’s case,
    thus a live issue at trial.</p>

    principles governing causation are well-settled. In the main, the evidence
    about the inadequacies of the braking system on the vehicle was not controversial.
    Factual causation was beyond dispute. The trial judge’s reasons, read as
    a whole, demonstrate that he seized the substance of the causation issue
    and applied the appropriate test. Despite their brevity under the heading “Causation”,
    the reasons as a whole measure up to what is required of them.</p>
