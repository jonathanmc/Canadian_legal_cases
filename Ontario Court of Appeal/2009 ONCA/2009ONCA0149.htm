  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    2001, the appellant pleaded guilty to, and was convicted of, the offences
    of criminal harassment and uttering threats.  His mental condition was a
    potential issue during the trial and sentencing proceedings, including the
    post-sentence hearing after the appellant breached his conditional sentence.  Throughout
    this period, both the Crown and defence were concerned about the appellant’s
    mental condition.  As a result, two psychiatrists became involved in assessing
    him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant served his sentence, but then decided to appeal his conviction
    on the basis that he was not criminally responsible due to a mental disorder
    (NCR-MD) at the time he committed the offences.  The appeal sputtered forward
    for several years.  In 2005, this court granted an extension of time within
    which to file an appeal.  Since then, the appellant has been assessed by
    four psychiatrists who were subsequently cross-examined on their reports.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant seeks to enter the evidence of all four psychiatrists as fresh
    evidence on the appeal.  The parties agree that the first three criteria
    of the test for the admission of fresh evidence on an appeal set out in <i>R.
    v. Palmer</i> [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759 are met in this case.  Their point of disagreement,
    and hence the central issue on this appeal, is whether the appellant can
    establish the fourth criterion of <i>Palmer</i> – could the fresh evidence,
    if believed, reasonably be expected to have affected the result?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    the appellant can establish that this fresh evidence should be admitted,
    then a second issue arises: should this court enter an NCR-MD verdict or
    order a new trial?</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>B. <u>FACTS</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant and the complainant became non-romantic friends in 1991 when they
    were both students at the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">
    University of
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Ottawa.  However, their friendship ended after he went to her apartment in
    March 1992, asked her to take a shower with him, told her that he wanted
    to commit suicide, and produced a knife.  The appellant was admitted to hospital
    for psychiatric treatment in March and June 1992.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    two occasions after their friendship ended, the appellant was charged with
    criminal offences involving the complainant, but the charges were withdrawn
    when the appellant entered into a peace bond.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From
    1993 to 1995, he was a psychiatric patient at the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Royal
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Ottawa
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Hospital.  Despite hospitalization and medical treatment, over the next few
    years the appellant continued to try to contact the complainant.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    December 20, 2000, the appellant confronted the complainant as she exited
    a grocery store.  He tried to convince her to meet with him.  The complainant
    tried to call for help using a pay phone; the appellant hung up the receiver.  He
    told her that she would regret it if she did not agree to meet with him.  He
    twice made throat-slashing motions across his neck while looking at the complainant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    June 2001, the appellant sent a 150-page letter to the complainant’s mother.  In
    the letter, the appellant chronicled his view of the history of his relationship
    with the complainant and tried to persuade the mother to assist in convincing
    her daughter to meet him.  In many places the letter is very troubling and
    demonstrates several times that the appellant explicitly recognized that
    the complainant was scared of him.  Moreover, in a number of places the language
    used in the letter was threatening:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>So yes, [she] can fight me using the police and
    that could ruin my life.  But if my life is going to be unhappy anyway, I
    don’t consider that as much of a disincentive.  I would also then likely
    give up on any plan for peace and be forced to retaliate against her for
    all the pain she has caused me.  My question of [her] is this:  Why risk
    it?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:
center'>. . .</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Now you could easily make a copy of this letter
    and send it to your local police station or to the Ontario College of Teachers.  Either
    way, you now have the power in your hands to ruin my life.  After all, I
    have made the somewhat veiled threat of saying that if [she] refuses to meet
    with me that I have thoughts of potential retribution that I may or may not
    act on.  I said that as a somewhat desperate attempt to finally get [her]
    to react to my request…If [she] flat out said “no” and threatened to use
    legal means to prevent me from contacting her any further, that would be
    awful.  At that point, I would have to make a choice whether to continue
    offering peace, or to give up and treat [her] as an enemy.  BUT IF THIS LETTER
    CAUSES ME TO LOSE MY POTENTIAL TEACHING CAREER, that would probably cause
    me to seek immediate and instant retribution.  Just so you know.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    two events resulted in criminal charges against the appellant for uttering
    threats and criminal harassment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    the charges were laid, the defence arranged for a psychiatric assessment
    by Dr. Paul Federoff, a forensic psychiatrist at the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Royal
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Ottawa
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Hospital.  Dr. Federoff was the co-director of the Sexual Behaviours Clinic
    at the hospital and a professor at the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    University of
    <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">
    Ottawa.  One of Dr. Federoff’s special interests was “courtship disorders” which
    include psychiatric disorders associated with abnormalities in romantic or
    sexual relationships.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his report of September 10, 2001, Dr. Federoff concluded that the appellant
    did not have the mental disorder erotomania (a sub-category of delusional
    disorder where a person wrongly believes that another person is in love with
    him or her) because the accused did not have a persistent belief that the
    complainant was in love with him.  He also observed that the appellant was
    aware that what he did was wrong and that future attempts to contact the
    complainant would be viewed as criminal.  In Dr. Federoff’s opinion, the
    appellant had an “over-valued idea” which means that “a commonly viewed belief
    is over-invested with emotional valance”.  The most common over-valued idea
    is anorexia nervosa.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    November 2, 2001, the appellant pleaded guilty to both offences.  On November
    7, 2001, a conditional sentence of nine months followed by three years’ probation
    was imposed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Early
    in 2002, the appellant was charged with breaching his conditional sentence,
    based on the allegation that he attempted to contact the complainant.  At
    the breach hearing, Dr. John Bradford, the head of the Division of Forensic
    Psychiatry at the
    <st1:PlaceName
w:st="on">
    Royal
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Ottawa

w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    University of
    <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">
    Ottawa, testified that the appellant had a delusional disorder (erotomanic
    type) and recurrent major depression.  Crown counsel asked Fontana J. to
    order an assessment specifically directed to the issue of criminal responsibility,
    on which Dr. Bradford’s report did not focus.  Justice Fontana held that
    he lacked jurisdiction on a breach hearing to make such an order.  He sentenced
    the appellant to house arrest for the remainder of his conditional sentence.  The
    appellant served this sentence and the subsequent probation without incident.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant now seeks to have his convictions set aside and a verdict of NCR-MD
    substituted.  In the 2003-2007 period, four psychiatrists have written reports
    about the appellant.  Two conclude that the appellant was NCR-MD when he
    committed the offences in 2000 and 2001; two conclude that he was not.  All
    four psychiatrists were cross-examined by counsel on their reports in 2007
    and 2008.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant seeks to have these reports admitted as fresh evidence.  If the
    reports are admitted, the appellant requests that the convictions be quashed
    and verdicts of NCR-MD be substituted or, alternatively, a new trial be ordered.</p>

    parties agree that the first three criteria for the admission of fresh evidence
    set out in <i>Palmer</i> – due diligence, relevance, and evidence reasonably
    capable of belief – are present in this case.  Accordingly, the central issue
    on the appeal is whether the fourth criterion – the evidence
    “must be such that if believed it could reasonably, when taken with the other
    evidence adduced at trial, be expected to have affected the result” (p. 775) –
    has been established.  The onus to establish this fourth criterion is on
    the appellant: see <i>R. v. M. (I.E.)</i> (2003), 173 C.C.C. (3d) 515 at
    para. 47 (On.
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where,
    as in this case, the appellant advances an NCR-MD claim, he bears the burden
    of establishing on the balance of probabilities that he was NCR-MD at the
    time of the offence: see <i>Criminal Code</i> s. 16(3).  Joining this burden
    with the fourth criterion from <i>Palmer</i>, the question becomes: could
    the fresh evidence, if believed, when taken with the rest of the evidence,
    reasonably lead the trial judge to conclude on the balance of probabilities
    that the appellant was NCR-MD at the relevant time?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>Criminal
      Code</i> provision that must be considered and applied in this appeal is
      s. 16(1):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>16(1) No person is criminally responsible for an
    act committed or an omission made while suffering from <i>a mental disorder</i> that
    rendered the person incapable of appreciating the nature and quality of the
    act or omission or of <i>knowing that it was wrong</i>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    five psychiatrists who examined the appellant from 2001 to 2007 disagreed
    in their analyses and conclusions with respect to both emphasized components
    of this provision.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, it is not necessary to analyze, and reach a conclusion about, whether
    the appellant had a “mental disorder” within s. 16(1) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>.  I say this because the real focus of the appeal and its resolution
    turns on the second component – “incapable of …
    knowing that it was wrong” – of s. 16(1).  Accordingly, I will assume that
    the fresh evidence offers a basis upon which a trial judge could be satisfied
    that the appellant suffers from a mental disorder.</p>

    appellant concedes that he knew what he was doing when he threatened and
    harassed the complainant in 2000 and 2001; hence the words “incapable of
    appreciating the nature and quality of the act” in s. 16(1) are not in play
    on this appeal.  The issue is the other component of s. 16(1): was the appellant “incapable
    of
    …knowing that it was wrong”?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    legal framework for addressing this question is found in the decisions of
    the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. Chaulk</i> [1990] 3 S.C.R. 1303 and <i>R.
    v. Oommen</i> [1994] 2 S.C.R. 507.  See also: <i>R. v. Fraser</i> (1997),

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Chaulk</i>,
    the court considered the meaning of the word “wrong” in s. 16(1), expanding
    it to go beyond legally wrong to include morally wrong.  Chief Justice Lamer,
    for the majority, stated at para. 97:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Viewed from this perspective, it is plain to me
    that the term “wrong” as used in s. 16(2) must mean more than simply legally
    wrong.  In considering the capacity of a person to know whether an act is
    one that he ought or ought not to do, the <u>inquiry cannot terminate with
    the discovery that the accused knew that the act was contrary to the formal
    law.  A person may well be aware that an act is contrary to law but, by reason
    of “natural imbecility” or disease of the mind, is at the same time incapable
    of knowing that the act is morally wrong in the circumstances according to
    the moral standards of society</u>.  This would be the case, for example,
    if the person suffered from a disease of the mind to such a degree as to
    know that it is legally wrong to kill but, as described by Dickson J. in <i>Schwartz</i>,
    kills “in the belief that it is in response to a divine order and therefore
    not morally wrong” (p. 678).  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Oommen</i>,
    the court affirmed <i>Chaulk</i> and clarified the focus of the inquiry relating
    to knowledge of the difference between right and wrong.  Justice McLachlin
    said at p. 516:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A review of the history of our insanity provision
    and the cases indicates that the inquiry focuses not on general capacity
    to know right from wrong, but rather on the ability to know that a particular
    act was wrong in the circumstances.  The accused must possess the intellectual
    ability to know right from wrong in an abstract sense.  But he or she must
    also possess the ability to apply that knowledge in a rational way to the
    alleged criminal act.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    decisions make it clear that a subjective belief by the accused that his
    conduct was justifiable will not spare him from criminal responsibility even
    if his personal views or beliefs were driven by mental disorder, as long
    as he retained the capacity to know that it was regarded as wrong on a societal
    standard: see <i>Chaulk</i> at para. 98.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Again,
    the five experts disagreed on this issue.  Dr. Bradford and Glancy opined
    that the appellant was incapable of knowing that his threatening and harassing
    conduct in 2000 and 2001 was morally wrong.  Dr. Gojer and Dr. Collins, as
    well as Dr. Federoff in his initial assessment for the defence in 2001, reached
    the opposite conclusion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the reports and testimony of Dr. Bradford and Dr. Glancy, taken
    together with the rest of the evidence, do not provide a basis upon which
    a trial judge could be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the appellant
    was incapable of knowing that his conduct was wrong when he committed the
    offences.  I say this for four reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    and most importantly, the appellant’s letter to the complainant’s mother
    in June 2001, which led directly to the criminal charges, is replete with
    statements that indicate that he was fully aware that his conduct towards
    the complainant was morally wrong.  He acknowledged that the complainant
    was scared of him and had feared him for nine years, that his throat-slashing
    gestures across his neck in her presence were “awful”, that his request that
    the complainant take a shower with him coupled with the production of a knife
    immediately thereafter was “a horrible moment”, and that he would seek retribution
    if the complainant reported him to the police or the Ontario College of Teachers.  In
    my view, these are the comments of a person entirely aware that his conduct
    was both morally and legally wrong.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    in his cross-examination Dr. Bradford acknowledged that the appellant’s statements
    in the letter reflected “an appreciation on his part of the perspective that
    his acts are wrongful, unacceptable, inappropriate”.  In my view, this description,
    and especially the word “unacceptable”, brings the appellant’s conduct within
    the <i>Chaulk</i> formulation of a person who knows that it is morally wrong “according
    to the moral standards of society.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    although Dr. Glancy offered his opinion that the appellant’s delusional disorder
    deprived him of the capacity for rational perception and rational judgment
    about the wrongfulness of his act, Dr. Glancy did not read the appellant’s
    letter to the complainant’s mother before preparing his report.  I am not
    inclined to attach much weight to an opinion that does not consider what
    I would call the ‘best evidence’ of the appellant’s own perception of his
    conduct.  Moreover, after he read the appellant’s letter during a break in
    his cross-examination, Dr. Glancy agreed that the letter “evinces some kind
    of insight on his part into how his conduct is perceived and the wisdom of
    trying to move beyond it” and that “he is capable of some kind of objective
    evaluation of his behaviour.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth,
    Dr. Federoff, Dr. Gojer and Dr. Collins concluded that the appellant was
    aware that his conduct in 2000 and 2001 was wrong.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Federoff, who assessed the appellant for the defence shortly after his arrest,
    said in his report on September 10, 2001: “In my discussions with Mr. Ross,
    I was left with the impression that he is aware that what he did was wrong
    and that future attempts to contact the victim would be viewed as criminal.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his cross-examination, Dr. Gojer testified:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I also part company with Dr. Bradford and Dr. Glancy
    on interpreting how this man’s belief systems, be they delusional or overvalued
    ideas, impacted on his ability to know the wrongfulness of his actions.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:
center'>. . .</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>What this guy is saying is very clear.  I know
    its going to cause grief to this person.  I know that, yes, I’ll be charged,
    and that you’ll go to the police.  He has got clear knowledge that his behaviour
    is having a negative impact on the victim.  There is no evidence that he
    does not appreciate the wrongfulness or know that what he is doing is wrong
    to [the complainant].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    in his cross-examination Dr. Collins stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>…I would still see him as being responsible, he
    could appreciate the nature of his actions.  Based on what he told me and
    based on his writings as well, if you look at the tome [the letter] … I would
    not view him, in my professional opinion as being a candidate for a section
    16 defence … Because he could spell out the consequences.  He knew what the
    possible consequences were for writing that tome as he puts it and what could
    possibly happen to him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, I conclude that the appellant has not established on a balance
    of probabilities that the reports and testimony of Dr. Bradford and Dr. Glancy,
    taken together with the rest of the evidence, provide a basis on which a
    trial judge could be satisfied that the appellant was incapable of knowing
    that his conduct was wrong.  This being the case, the appellant failed to
    meet the fourth criterion in <i>Palmer</i>.  It follows that I would not
    admit the fresh evidence on this appeal.</p>
