    Stucky, a resident of
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario, operated a direct mail business in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario that sold lottery tickets and merchandise only to persons outside
    of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  He was charged with sixteen counts of making false or misleading representations “to
    the public” between 1995 and 2002 in order to promote his business interests,
    contrary to s. 52(1) of the <i>Competition Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-34
    (the “Act”).  The charges pertained to four direct mail promotions sent primarily
    to people in the
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>
    ,
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Great Britain</st1:country-region>

    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      New Zealand</st1:country-region>
    .  The promotions were not mailed to anyone in

w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    52(1) of the Act currently reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>No person shall, for the purpose of promoting,
    directly or indirectly, the supply or use of a product or for the purpose
    of promoting, directly or indirectly, any business interest, by any means
    whatever, knowingly or recklessly make a representation <i>to the public</i> that
    is false or misleading in a material respect. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found Mr. Stucky not guilty of the charges because he held that
    the phrase “to the public” means “to the <i>Canadian</i> public” and none
    of the mailings were made to persons in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  The trial judge also determined that but for this interpretation of “to
    the public”, he would have convicted Mr. Stucky of six of the counts in the
    indictment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown appeals.  It submits that the trial judge erred in interpreting the
    phrase “to the public” as limited to the Canadian public.  If successful
    in its appeal, the Crown seeks to have convictions entered on the six counts
    on which Mr. Stucky would otherwise have been convicted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Stucky submits that if the Crown is successful on appeal, a new trial should
    be ordered, principally because the trial judge’s interventions during the
    proceedings undermined the appearance of fairness of the trial and compromised
    Mr. Stucky’s ability to present a full answer and defence to the charges. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Four
    of the counts on which Mr. Stucky would otherwise have been convicted related
    to promotions that took place from 1995 to 1999 (the “pre-1999 counts”).  In
    that period, s. 52(1) of the Act created a strict liability offence.  For
    strict liability offences, the prosecution must prove beyond a reasonable
    doubt that the accused committed the prohibited act.  The onus then shifts
    to the accused who can avoid liability by establishing, on a balance of probabilities,
    that he or she acted with due diligence.  Prior to the 1999 amendments to
    the Act,<i> </i>s. 60(2) provided for a due diligence defence, as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>No person shall be convicted of an offence under
    section 52…if he establishes that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(b)       he took reasonable precautions and
    exercised due diligence to prevent the occurrence of the error.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    mounting his due diligence defence, Mr. Stucky placed heavy reliance on the
    fact that he had sought and acted on legal advice in respect of the promotions.  He
    argues that the trial judge erred in finding that the due diligence defence
    had not been made out. The Crown submits that the trial judge reached the
    right conclusion but erred in treating reliance on legal advice as a mistake
    of fact.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    remaining two counts at issue on appeal cover the time period from 1999 to
    2002 (the “post-1999 counts”).  After the 1999 amendments to the Act, s.
    52 created an offence requiring proof of the accused’s <i>mens rea</i>.  Mr.
    Stucky argues that the trial judge erred in relation to these counts in finding
    that the Crown had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that he possessed the
    requisite mental element.  Again, he maintains that he honestly believed
    the promotions were not false and misleading based on the legal advice he
    had received.  In respect of these counts, the Crown and Mr. Stucky differ
    on what must be proved to satisfy the <i>mens rea</i> component of s. 52.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Our
    conclusions on these issues can be briefly summarized.  We would allow the
    Crown’s appeal on the meaning of s. 52(1) of the Act and hold that the phrase “to
    the public” is not restricted to the Canadian public.  We conclude that trial
    fairness requires that the matter be remitted for a new trial.  In light
    of our conclusion that a new trial is warranted, we address only the strict
    legal issues that were raised in respect of the counts on which Mr. Stucky
    would otherwise have been convicted.  In respect of the pre-1999 offences,
    we conclude that it was not open to Mr. Stucky to advance a mistake of fact
    defence based on the legal advice that he had received.  In relation to the
    post-1999 offences, we conclude that the trial judge made no error in holding
    that to satisfy the <i>mens rea</i> component, the Crown was required to
    prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Stucky knew of the falsity or misleading
    nature of the representations, or had been reckless in that regard.  In view
    of our conclusions, we find it unnecessary to deal with the other issues
    raised by Mr. Stucky.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>II.        The meaning of “to
      the public” in s. 52 of the Act<i></i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this section of the judgment, we will review the historical evolution of
    the misleading advertising legislation and the enforcement scheme of the
    Act.  We then discuss why, contrary to the trial judge’s decision, the phrase “to
    the public”
    should not be limited in its meaning to persons in Canada, with reference
    to relevant criminal law jurisprudence and the principles of statutory interpretation.   </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>1)        The history of false
      and misleading advertising legislation</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    the misleading advertising section was first enacted in the <i>Criminal</i> <i>Code</i> in
    1914, the word “public” did not appear, as the provision was simply concerned
    with the publishing of an advertisement and not the making of a false or
    misleading representation generally: S.C. 1914, c. 24. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    1960, the <i>Combines Investigation Act</i> was amended to prohibit the making
    of a misleading representation “to the public” in relation to price: S.C.
    1960, c. 45.  At that time,<i> </i>the misleading advertising prohibition
    was still contained in the <i>Criminal</i> <i>Code</i>. <i>  </i> </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    1969, the misleading advertising section of the <i>Code</i> was repealed.  The
    prohibition against misleading advertising became part of the <i>Combines
    Investigation Act</i>: S.C. 1969, c. 38.  In 1975, the price misrepresentation
    and misleading advertising sections of the <i>Combines Investigation Act</i> were
    combined into one section, and the offence of misleading advertising was
    broadened.  “To the public” became one of the constituent elements of the
    offence of misleading advertising, and the offence included not just published
    advertisements but “representations” to the public: S.C. 1974-75, c. 76.   The
    regime for enforcement remained a criminal regime, and conviction could result
    in imprisonment.  <b><i></i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    1986, the <i>Combines Investigation Act </i>was renamed the <i>Competition
    Act</i>: S.C. 1986, c. 19 (2<sup>nd</sup> Supp.).<b><i></i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    1999, a number of significant amendments respecting the false and misleading
    advertising provisions of the Act were made.  Section 52 was changed from
    a strict liability offence to a full <i>mens rea </i>offence: S.C. 1999,
    c. 2. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    1999 amendments also<i> </i>created an administrative or regulatory regime
    in Part VII.1 of the Act, entitled “Deceptive Marketing Practices”.  Section
    74.01(1)(a) in Part VII.1 provides that a person engages in “reviewable conduct” when
    that person makes a false or misleading material representation “to the public”.  The
    section<i> </i>mirrors s. 52 in making reference to misleading representations
    “to the public”.  Unlike s. 52, the making of a misleading representation
    in s. 74.01(1)(a) is a matter of strict liability for which the Competition
    Tribunal may order a monetary penalty or make another remedial order.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>2)        Enforcement of the
      Act</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    a result of the 1999 amendments, the Act<i> </i>is enforced in the following
    way.  The Commissioner of Competition, an independent law enforcement official
    who is responsible for the Act’s administration and enforcement under s.
    7, may commence a preliminary examination, e.g. if a complaint is received,
    or may commence a formal examination under ss. 9 or 10 of the Act.  If the
    Commissioner concludes that a contravention of the Act<i> </i>has taken place,
    the Commissioner may either refer the matter to the federal Attorney General,
    who decides whether or not to prosecute, or take the administrative route
    and make an application to the Competition Tribunal: see s. 23 of the Act
    and Brian A. Facey and Dany H. Assaf, <i>Competition and Antitrust Law: Canada
    and the United States</i>, 3<sup>rd</sup> ed.<i> </i>(Toronto: Butterworths,
    2006), at pp. 29, 37-39.  Thus, in the case of an alleged misleading representation,
    the Commissioner may refer the matter to the Attorney General in which case
    a criminal prosecution may take place under s. 52,  or the Commissioner may
    take the administrative route and apply to the Competition Tribunal for a
    decision that a contravention of s. 74.01(1)(a) has taken place.  Once charges
    have been laid or an application has been filed before the Competition Tribunal,
    the Competition Bureau may not switch regimes: see<i> </i>Facey and Assef
    at p. 384. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    proceedings before Parliament when the 1999 changes were made, the Minister
    of Industry stated that criminal sanctions for misleading advertising and
    deceptive marketing practices remained in place for the most serious cases,
    while less serious cases could be dealt with through the administrative regime:
    see <i>R. v. Benlolo </i>(2006), 81 O.R. (3d) 440 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge, without expressly saying so, appears to have concluded that
    traditional principles of criminal law had limited application to the prosecution
    of a public welfare offence such as that under s. 52.  In his decision, he
    referred to <i>R. v. City of
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Sault Ste. Marie, </i>[1978] 2 S.C.R. 1299.  In that case, Dickson J., on
    behalf of a unanimous court, at pp. 1302-1303, recognized public welfare
    offences as a distinct class of offences that, “although enforced as penal
    laws through the machinery of the criminal law, are in substance of a civil
    nature and might well be regarded as a branch of administrative law to which

    the decision in <i>Sault Ste. Marie, </i>the distinction between criminal
    and regulatory offences has blurred.  The label attached to the offence is
    no longer determinative. Rather, the penalties attached to the conduct, the
    values underlying the offence, and whether the offence is one for which <i>mens
    rea </i>is required must be considered. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In <i>R.
      v. Wholesale Travel Group Inc.</i>, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 154,  the Supreme Court
      was concerned with whether certain misleading advertising provisions then
      contained in the Act<i> </i>were inconsistent with ss. 7 and 11(d) of the <i>Canadian
      Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</i>  The provisions created a strict liability
      offence and codified what was essentially the common law defence of due
      diligence coupled with the requirement of a timely retraction. <span style='font-size:12.0pt'> </span>One
      of the arguments advanced by the Crown in seeking to have the legislation
      upheld was that the principles of fundamental justice in the <i>Charter</i> should
      be interpreted differently because the offence was a regulatory offence,
      as opposed to a criminal offence.  Lamer C.J.C. rejected this argument,
      stating at p. 189 that the principles of fundamental justice did not take
      on a different meaning “simply because the offence can be labelled as
    ‘regulatory’”.  He concluded that liability for imprisonment, as opposed
    to the label attached to the offence, was determinative of the analysis to
    be undertaken.  La Forest J. agreed and observed at p. 209 that what is ultimately
    important are not the labels but the values at stake in the particular context.  The
    fact that a five year term of imprisonment could be imposed if an individual
    was convicted required stricter conformity with the principles of fundamental
    justice than mere monetary penalties.  As well, Cory J. was of the opinion
    that true crimes require <i>mens rea</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    penalty of imprisonment applies to all the counts with which Mr. Stucky was
    charged.  The offence is designed for protection of the public through reinforcement
    of the value of honesty, a value emphasized in the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  In
    addition, in relation to the post-1999 counts, the requirement that the false
    or misleading misrepresentation be made “knowingly or recklessly” means that <i>mens
    rea</i> is required to be proved by the Crown beyond a reasonable doubt.  </p>

    a case with facts similar to the instant case in which the court was required
    to interpret the meaning of
    “the public”. <span> </span>The accused were charged with several <i>Criminal</i> <i>Code </i>offences,
    including conspiracy to defraud the public by deceit, falsehood or other
    fraudulent means, and using the mail to transmit letters for the purposes
    of defrauding the public and obtaining money under false pretences: S.C.
    1953-54, c. 51, ss. 323(1) and 324.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

    and the meaning of the phrase “the public” in the provisions because, o<span
style='color:black'>n the facts before the court, the only members of the public
    who were defrauded were residents of the
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place

      United States</st1:country-region>
    .  In relation to the conspiracy to defraud offence, the court held at p.
    349:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The completion of the offence under s. 323(1) lies
    in the obtaining of the fruits of the fraudulent means or inducement … If
    there is an initiation of a fraudulent scheme in Canada (as was the case
    here in the mailing out of the letters of solicitation) and a realization
    thereof in Canada through receipt of money or securities intended to be brought
    in through the scheme, the offence has been committed in Canada although
    the inducement has extended only to persons outside Canada.  In short, &quot;the
    public or any person&quot; in s. 323(1) are not limited to the Canadian public
    or to persons in
    <st1:place w:st="on">

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly,
    in <i>Libman</i>, the <a name="PNUM_59">accused was charged with seven counts
    of fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit fraud arising from a telephone
    solicitation sales scheme operated from </a>

    proceeds returned to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  La Forest J., on behalf of the court, began by noting that the presumption
    against extraterritoriality in criminal law was codified in s. 5(2) (now
    s. 6(2)) of the <i>Criminal</i> <i>Code</i>, R.S.C. 1970, c. C.34, which
    states that no person “shall be convicted in Canada for an offence committed
    outside of Canada”.  However, he concluded that the offences in question
    had taken place in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  The commission of the offences had a real and substantial connection to
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    , in that the scheme was devised in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    , and the operation and directing minds were situated in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  In coming to this conclusion, La Forest J. discussed and approved the
    holding in the <i>Chapman</i> decision.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    reasoning La Forest J. followed is equally applicable to this case and may
    be summarized along these lines:
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    has a legitimate interest in prosecuting persons for unlawful activities
    that take place abroad when the activities have a “real and substantial link” or
    connection to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  The fact that the only victims are outside of
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    does not make the activity any the less unlawful or mean that no crime has
    been committed in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    when there exists “a real and substantial link” or connection to this country.  The
    court must take into consideration all the facts that give
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    an interest in prosecuting the offence and then consider whether international
    comity would be offended in the circumstances.  The principle of extraterritoriality
    has not prevented courts from taking jurisdiction over transnational offences
    whose impact is felt within the country.  The purpose of criminal law is
    to protect the public from harm.  That purpose is not achieved only by direct
    means, but also by underlining the fundamental values of our society and,
    in so doing, reinforcing the law-abiding sentiments of our society.  La Forest
    J. reflected at p. 212 that utilizing a “real and substantial link” approach
    is necessary in order to reinforce the fundamental  values of society:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It would be a sad commentary on our law if it was
    limited to underlining society’s values by the prosecution of minor offenders
    while permitting more seasoned practitioners to operate on a world-wide scale
    from a Canadian base by the simple manipulation of a technicality of the
    law’s own making.  What would be underlined in the public’s mind by allowing
    criminals to go free simply because their operations have grown to international
    proportions, I shall not attempt to expound.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although
    the <i>Chapman </i>and <i>Libman </i>decisions were submitted to the trial
    judge he declined to follow their reasoning.  Instead, the trial judge’s
    review of the historical evolution of the provisions dealing with false or
    misleading representations led him to conclude that when the concept of “materially
    misleading misrepresentation to the public” was introduced in relation to
    pricing,
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    had a limited role as a world exporter.  He held that the “public” reference
    was domestically oriented, applying the “original meaning” rule of interpretation.  An
    example of one piece of legislative history the trial judge relied on in
    support of his position comes from the comments made by the Minister of Justice
    in 1974 when introducing a predecessor section to s. 52.  Referring to the
    prohibition on false or misleading advertising, the Minister stated that “all
    Canadians”
    can benefit from a competitive marketplace: <i>House of Commons Debates</i> (March
    1, 1974) at 480-481 (Hon. Herb Gray). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    our opinion, the trial judge took an overly restrictive approach in interpreting
    the scope of s. 52.  As noted by Ruth Sullivan in <i>Sullivan and Driedger
    on the Construction of Statutes</i>, 4<sup>th</sup> ed. (Markham, Ont.: LexisNexis,
    2002), at p. 113:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[L]egislation that is enacted to regulate an ongoing
    activity over an indefinite period of time invites a dynamic interpretation
    whereas legislation that is aimed at a particular set of circumstances or
    is otherwise tied to a specific time or place invites a fixed interpretation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Direct
    mailing is an ongoing activity over an indefinite period of time that the
    Act<i> </i>regulates.  A dynamic approach to the interpretation of s. 52
    is more appropriate.  We elaborate further on the appropriateness of this
    approach in dealing with the statutory interpretation of s. 52.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge also relied on the presumption against extraterritorial application
    of legislation and the principle that any ambiguity in legislation ought
    to be interpreted favourably to the accused to buttress his conclusion that
    the phrase “to the public” was restricted to the Canadian public.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[32]<span

    interpret the phrase “to the public” as being broader than the Canadian public
    does not violate the presumption against extraterritoriality.  In this case,
    the Act<i> </i>is being applied to the conduct of a person who is in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    , whose alleged misrepresentations were initiated in

    .  There is a real and substantial connection between the offence alleged

    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    , notwithstanding the fact that the “public” to whom the representations
    were made was located outside
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>

    the “real and substantial link” or connection test articulated in <i>Libman</i> has

    however, is that judges are required to interpret a statute by using that
    framework to achieve a result that promotes the purposes of the legislation
    and produces harmony both within the statute itself and legislation dealing

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Both
    the Crown and Mr. Stucky agree that the primary object of the Act<i> </i>is
    to protect Canadian businesses.  Indeed, one of the express purposes of the
    Act is to encourage competition
    “in order to expand opportunities for Canadian participation in world markets”.  Also,
    the Act<i> </i>is intended to discourage forms of commercial behaviour that
    are viewed as detrimental to

    Policy in Canada: The First Hundred Years </i>(Ottawa: Consumer and Corporate
    Affairs, 1989), at p. 48:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Along with the obvious need to protect consumers
    from direct exploitation by semi-fraudulent types of representations, misrepresentation
    may also cause injury to honest competitors by distorting the functioning
    of the market.  As noted earlier, the impetus toward effective misleading
    advertising laws in 1960 was due to pressure from business, not consumers.</p>

    trial judge’s historical analysis led him to conclude that the Act was originally
    intended to protect only Canadian consumers and that he should implement
    the original intent of the legislation.  However, in contrast to the trial
    judge’s findings, there is evidence in the legislative debates that Parliament
    was, historically, concerned with the success of Canadian business abroad.  For
    example, the Minister of Justice in 1960, the Hon. Davie Fulton, commented
    in the <i>House of Commons Debates</i>, May 30, 1960, at pp. 4342 that the
    Canadian economy was dependent on “successful competition in international
    as well as domestic markets”, and that anti-combines legislation should take
    into account the
    “economic climate” in which
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    exists.  As noted, Canadian businesses operating in foreign markets risk
    damage to their reputation when other Canadian businesses acting abroad engage
    in misleading representation.  By using its prosecutorial powers to combat
    such conduct, the Canadian government promotes the Act’s goal of encouraging
    Canadian business success worldwide.  Section 52 should be interpreted in
    a manner which accords with this goal.  </p>
  <h3><i>ii)        The Act must be harmonized with other legislation dealing

    interpretation presumes a harmony, coherence, and consistency between statutes
    dealing with essentially the same subject matter: <i>R. v. Ulybel Enterprises
    Ltd.</i>,<i> </i>[2001] 2 S.C.R. 867, at para 52 and <i>Bell ExpressVu</i> at
    para. 27.  Section 380(1) of the <i>Code </i>and s. 52 of the Act are both
    intended to protect the public from similar misconduct.  Section 380 of the <i>Code</i> makes
    it an offence to
    “defraud the public or any person” by “deceit, falsehood or other fraudulent
    means” whereas s. 52 of the Act makes it an offence to “knowingly or recklessly
    make a representation to the public that is false or misleading in a material
    respect”.  As already discussed, the prohibition in the <i>Code</i> extends
    to situations where representations emanating from
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    are made to persons outside
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    this case, agreements between Canada and the United States reveal that the
    Canadian government is aware of the cross-border impact of deceptive mail
    and telemarketing practices, and has promised to cooperate and coordinate
    efforts to address this: see the <i>Agreement between the Government of Canada
    and the Government of the United States of America Regarding the Application
    of Their Competition and Deceptive Marketing Practices Law </i>(the 1995
    Agreement) and the <i>US – Canadian Task Force on Cross-Border Deceptive
    Marketing Practices Agreement, September 10, 1996 </i>(the 1996 Agreement).  Article
    VII(1) of the 1995 Agreement includes ss. 52-60 of the Act<i> </i>in its
    definition of deceptive marketing practices laws, and Canada and the United
    States agree to coordinate their enforcement against deceptive marketing
    practices with a trans-border dimension in Article VII(3)(d).  The approach
    adopted by the trial judge would undermine these agreements, as opposed to
    furthering a cooperative approach. </p>

    the Act must be interpreted not only in a fashion which is consistent with
    the <i>Code, </i>but also with an eye to the internal coherence of its own
    scheme.  Words take their meaning from the context in which they are found.  In
    interpreting a statutory provision, courts must have regard to any adjacent
    and closely-related provisions as well as the act as a whole: see Sullivan
    at pp. 261-262. </p>

    in prize promotions (as captured in s. 53).  Sections 52.1 and 53 were added

    trial judge concluded that the most important point in favour of Mr. Stucky’s
    interpretation was the distinction between s. 52(1), which contains the phrase “to
    the public” and ss. 52.1 and 53, which do not.  He held that ss. 52.1 and
    53, which were enacted after s. 52(1), reflect Canada’s “commitment to issues
    surrounding international commerce” (para. 55) and were not limited to representations
    to persons in Canada because they did not contain the “to the public” language.  </p>

    to persons outside Canada, it would have amended s. 52 by deleting the words “to

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We

    the section’s public welfare objective, the principle of harmonization suggests
    the court should reject that interpretation in favour of an interpretation
    that carries out Parliament’s overall objective.  In our opinion, Parliament’s
    objective was to protect all those receiving or viewing various forms of
    communications from an overall impression that is misleading or deceptive
    in a material respect.  The interpretation adopted by the trial judge fails
    to take into account the shared objectives of the other, closely-related
    misleading advertising provisions in the Act, which are not limited to persons

    choosing to give effect to what he perceived to be the original intent of
    the legislation, the trial judge ignored the evolution in competition law
    thinking which has led to an increased concern with international business
    practices.  This concern is reflected not only in the enactment of further
    sections of the Act<i> </i>to deal with practices such as telemarketing and
    the Internet, but also cross-border agreements between Canada and the United
    States.  Our understanding of legislation should take into account current
    circumstances.  As Sullivan writes at p. 145 of the fifth edition of her
    text, <i>Sullivan on the Construction of Statutes</i>, 5<sup>th</sup> ed.
    (Markham, Ont.: LexisNexis, 2008):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>As a rule, the public Acts of a legislature are
    not meant to operate as historical documents.  They are written with an eye
    to the indefinite future, on the assumption that they will be applied not
    only to the facts in existence at the time they come into force but also
    to conditions and circumstances as they evolve from time to time.  This assumption
    is codified in s. 10 of the federal <i>Interpretation Act</i> [R.S.C. 1985,
    c. I-21]:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>The law shall be considered as always speaking,

    example of the court adopting an interpretation that carries out Parliament’s
    overall objective having regard to the existence of legislation enacted after
    the section in question can be found in <i>Libman</i>.  The accused was charged
    with conspiracy to commit the criminal offence of fraud in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    pursuant to what was then s. 423(1)(d) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  By contrast,
    section 423(3) of the <i>Code</i>, which was enacted after some of the acts
    charged occurred, expressly dealt with conspiracies entered into in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    to commit a crime outside
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  Counsel argued that, as a result, s. 423(1)(d), under which the accused
    was charged, only applied to conspiracies to commit a crime in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    but did not apply where the intended victims were outside
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region

    .  As we have indicated, the Supreme Court rejected this argument, holding
    that an offence that had a real and substantial link to
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    took place in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  Without expressly saying that it was applying the principle of harmonization,
    the Supreme Court opted for an interpretation that carried out the overall

    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    to other countries by mail, but prohibits those representations when they
    are made by telephone or in regard to winning a prize.  There is no juristic
    or practical reason for such a distinction. <span> </span>The trial judge’s
    interpretation undermines, rather than promotes, the express objectives of

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition to the telemarketing and prize-winning provisions, the trial judge
    also focused on subsections within s. 52 in interpreting the meaning of “to
    the public”.  He concluded that ss. 52(2)(e) and (f) of the pre-1999 Act
    and s. 52(2.1) of the post-1999 Act, which impose liability on importers
    for bringing false misrepresentations in Canada, illustrate that Parliament
    was not concerned with a representation unless it was “imported”
    into Canada.  They state:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Pre-1999:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>52(2) For the purpose of this section and section
    53, a representation that is</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(e) contained in or on anything that is sold,
    sent, delivered, transmitted or in any other manner whatever made available
    to a member of the public,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>shall be deemed to be made to the public by and
    only by the person who caused the representation to be so expressed, made
    or contained and, where that person is outside
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    , by</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(f) the person who imported the article into
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    , in a case described in paragraph (a), (b) or (e)</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Post-1999:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=indentlabel1>52(2.1)</span> Where a
    person referred to in subsection (2) is outside Canada, a representation
    described in paragraph (2)(<span

    (<span class=italic1><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Arial'>b</span></span>),

    or (<span class=italic1><span style='font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Arial'>e</span></span>)
    is, for the purposes of subsection (1), deemed to be made to the public by
    the person who imports into Canada the article, thing or display referred
    to in that paragraph.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>The trial judge’s conclusion was
    underscored by the fact that s. 52(2)(d) of the Act (which did not change
    significantly after 1999) did not form part of the importation subsection.  That
    subsection provides that a representation made in the course of “in-store,
    door-to-door or telephone selling to a person as ultimate user” is deemed
    to be made to the public by and only by the person who causes the representation
    to be so expressed, made or contained.  He found that including it was unnecessary,
    as
    “it spoke to [in store, door-to-door and telephone] representations which
    by their very nature could only be made on the ground and in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Before
    us, Mr. Stucky argued that if the words “to the public” mean “a group of
    people”, as opposed to the Canadian public, the word “public” could not be
    given a consistent interpretation through out the Act, as required: see <i>Thomson
    v.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    (Minister of Agriculture)</i>,<i> </i>[1992] 1 S.C.R. 385, at p. 387.  He
    argues that if “the public” were given a consistent meaning, the importer
    subsections would purport to criminalize representations made by a person
    outside
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    to any persons, including those outside
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    disagree.  The importing provisions do not use the phrase “to the public” and
    have no bearing on the meaning of “to the public” that is, to a group of
    persons, with whom the accused has a real and substantial connection.  The
    Act contains rules governing the competitive behaviour of Canadian businesses.  Whereas
    some of its provisions have broad general application, others are directed
    at specific groups (see, for instance, the reference to suppliers in s. 52(3)).  The
    importer subsections simply address one type of situation – namely, where
    misleading representations are imported into
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  Parliament’s decision to make importers responsible has no bearing on
    the accused’s responsibility to the public.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge also considered other sections in the Act.  In particular, he
    referred to ss. 45, 46 and 49 as evidence of the Act’s “Canadiancentric” nature.  These
    sections are summarized below:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>s. 45(5): A conspiracy, combine,
      agreement or arrangement is not punishable if it relates only to the export
      of products from
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  It should be noted that s. 45(6) specifies that an export conspiracy,
    combine, agreement or arrangement is punishable if it has prevented or lessened,
    or is likely to prevent or lessen, competition in the Canadian export business. </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>s. 46:&nbsp; An offence in respect
      of a conspiracy which emanates from outside
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    is committed only if the directive that would infringe s. 45 affects a corporation
    in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    .</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>s. 49(1) and (2): Financial institutions
      are prohibited from entering into anti-competitive arrangements or agreements,
      unless they are aimed at customers outside Canada or are otherwise to be
      performed outside Canada or “unless the agreement or arrangement is with
      respect to a deposit or loan made or payable outside Canada<a name="_ftnref35">”.</a></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Act<i> </i>as a whole reflects different purposes.  Sections 45, 46 and 49,
    in particular, are concerned with market power and market delineation.  In
    this case, we are concerned with combating false or misleading advertising
    practices.  As Lamer C.J.C. observed in <i>Wholesale Travel </i>at pp. 190-191,
    while the overall objective of the Act,<i> </i>in general, may be to promote
    vigorous and fair competition, the objective of the provision in issue here
    is significantly narrower.  That objective is two-fold: to protect consumers
    from the effects of false or misleading statements; and, to prevent those
    making such statements from reaping the benefits stemming from these statements.  In
    interpreting the phrase
    “to the public”, the trial judge did not consider this second objective.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Our
    analysis of the words “to the public” would not limit “the public” exclusively

    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  We, therefore, reject the trial judge’s interpretation of the phrase “to
    the public” in s. 52(1), and hold, instead, that it should be interpreted
    as meaning “a group of persons” with whom the accused has a real and substantial
    link or connection.</p>

    of the <i>Code</i> on a number of grounds.  The first of these is that the

    v. Brouillard</i>, [1985] 1 S.C.R. 39, at p. 42.  In the case at bar, the
    trial lasted 69 days and involved the examination of multiple witnesses,
    including experts and the accused himself.  Notwithstanding the length and
    complexity of a particular trial, a trial judge must exercise restraint and
    maintain impartiality so as to act within the scope of his or her neutral
    role.  As cautioned by Lamer J. in <i>Brouillard</i>, at pp. 42-43:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Like anyone, a judge may occasionally lose patience.  He
    may then step down from his judge’s bench and assume the role of counsel.  When
    this happens, and, <i>a fortiori</i>, when this happens to the detriment
    of an accused, it is important that a new trial be ordered, even when the
    verdict of guilty is not unreasonable having regard to the evidence, and
    the judge has not erred with respect to the law applicable to the case and
    has not incorrectly assessed the facts. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The reason for this is well-known.  It is one of
    the most fundamental principles of our case law [citation omitted]</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Brouillard</i>,
    at p. 44, Lamer J. acknowledged that a trial judge may intervene to ask questions,
    and, where necessary, he or she has a duty to ask questions where justice
    requires it.  However, at the same time, he expressly warned that there are
    definite limits on this right: <i>Brouillard </i>at p. 46.  A trial judge “should
    confine himself as much as possible to his own responsibilities and leave
    to counsel…[his or her] function”: <i>R. v. Torbiak and Campbell</i> (1974),
    18 C.C.C. (2d) 229 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">

    ), at pp. 230-231.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R.
      v. Valley</i> (1986), 26 C.C.C. (3d) 207 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 230, leave
      to appeal refused, [1986] 1 S.C.R. xiii, Martin J.A. set out three situations
      in which questions put by a trial judge to a witness may be justified,
      namely: to clear up ambiguities and call a witness to order; to explore
      some matter which the witnesses’ answers have left vague; or, to put questions
      which should have been asked by counsel in order to bring out some relevant
      matter, but which were nonetheless omitted.  He noted, however, that questions
      put by a trial judge to a witness should generally be put after counsel
      has completed his or her examination of the witness and, further, that
      the witness should not be cross-examined by the trial judge during examination-in-chief: <i>Valley </i>at
      p. 230.  These comments<i> </i>provide guidance as to the timing and nature
      of interventions that a trial judge may make. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first two situations of permitted interventions by the trial judge set out
    in <i>Valley</i> are self-explanatory.  The third situation in which a trial
    judge is permitted to intervene, namely, to ask questions that should have
    been asked by counsel, is not an open-ended invitation to the trial judge
    to usurp the role of Crown counsel.  The judge cannot leave his or her position
    of neutrality as a fact-finder and become the cross-examiner: <i>R. v. W.(A.) </i>(1994),
    94 C.C.C. (3d) 441 (Ont.

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where
    the appearance of fairness is not maintained at trial, the verdict reached
    cannot stand and a new trial must be ordered.  In deciding whether or not
    the appearance of fairness has been compromised, one factor that warrants
    consideration is whether the trial judge gave counsel an opportunity to ask
    questions that arise out of the trial judge’s questioning of a witness, in
    particular, the accused.  An additional factor is whether counsel objected
    to the trial judge’s questioning of a witness.  The absence of an objection,
    however, is not in itself determinative. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    turn now to the test for determining when this unfairness threshold is met.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>3)        The test for determining
      whether the trial judge’s interventions have compromised the appearance
      of trial fairness</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    test is an objective one.  As stated by Martin J.A. in <i>Valley</i>, at
    p. 232:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The ultimate question to be answered is not whether
    the accused was in fact prejudiced by the interventions but whether he might
    reasonably consider that he had not had a fair trial or <i>whether a reasonably
    minded person who had been present throughout the trial would consider that
    the accused had not had a fair trial.</i> [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appearance of fairness and the trial judge’s corresponding duty to exercise
    restraint and remain neutral is especially critical in the criminal context
    where the accused takes the stand: <i>Brouillard </i>at p. 48.  Since a criminal
    trial is an adversarial process between the prosecution and defence, and
    not an investigation by the trial judge, the examination and cross-examination
    of witnesses is, for the most part, the responsibility of counsel: <i>Valley </i>at
    p. 231.  Although the trial judge is justified in occasionally intervening
    for one of the legitimate purposes indicated above, the trial judge must
    be careful not to usurp the role of counsel because otherwise the overall
    impression created may be fatal to the appearance of trial fairness.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    effect of interventions by the trial judge on the appearance of trial fairness
    in a given case must be assessed in relation to the unique facts and circumstances
    of the particular trial: <i>Valley </i>at p. 231, citing <i>Torbiak</i> at
    p. 231.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Valley</i> at
    pp. 231-32, Martin J.A. listed types of interventions by trial judges which
    have resulted in the quashing of criminal convictions:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.         Questioning an accused or a defence
    witness to such an extent or in a manner which conveys the impression that
    the trial judge has placed the authority of his or her office on the side
    of the prosecution and conveys the impression that the trial judge disbelieves
    the accused or the witness;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Interventions
    which have effectively made it impossible for defence counsel to perform
    his or her duty in advancing the defence; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3.         Interventions which effectively preclude
    the accused from telling his or her story in his or her own way.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Interventions
    by a trial judge which can reasonably be said to create the appearance of
    an unfair trial may be of more than one type, and trial fairness may be undermined
    by one or more types of interventions: <i>Valley </i>at p. 232.  However,
    it is important to emphasize that no trial is perfect.  Accordingly, the
    record must be assessed in its totality and the interventions complained
    of in a given case must be evaluated cumulatively, not as isolated occurrences,
    from the perspective of a reasonable observer present throughout the trial.  As
    stated by Doherty J.A. in <i>R. v. Stewart</i> (1991), 62 C.C.C. (3d) 289
    (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    ), at p. 320:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is a question of degree.  At some point, incidents
    which, considered in isolation, may be excused as regrettable but of no consequence,
    combine to create an overall appearance which is incompatible with our standards
    of fairness.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Each
    of the three lottery promotions – the Canadian Lottery Buyers Association
    (CLBA) promotion, the International Lottery Commission (ILC) promotion, and
    the International Monetary Funding (IMF) promotion – involved the direct

    promotion which offered consumers an opportunity to receive, in exchange
    for a fixed fee, one of twenty-five “entitlement premiums”
    or items, depending on a pre-assigned registration number.  These entitlement
    premiums ranged in size and value, from a significant amount of money payable
    (e.g. £3,000) down to a piece of costume jewellery of indeterminate and undisclosed
    value.  Between these two extremes there was an array of household products
    of varying values.  The CEF promotion was sent to English-speaking residents

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>5)        The trial judge’s
      interventions</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the case at bar, it is clear that the trial judge was aware of his right
    to intervene, particularly where he believed that Crown counsel had failed
    to ask questions which he felt arose from the evidence or had otherwise failed
    to pursue avenues of inquiry which the trial judge regarded as important.  Cumulatively,
    over the duration of the trial, the trial judge interrupted the examination
    and cross-examination of defence witnesses, including Mr. Stucky, over twenty
    times.  During these interventions, the trial judge conducted a vigorous
    cross-examination of the witness, often after Crown counsel had expressly
    indicated that he was finished dealing with the particular area in question.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge also made sarcastic comments, some of which suggested that he
    had prematurely judged the witness’ credibility. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    occasion, defence counsel objected to the questioning of defence witnesses,
    including the accused, by the trial judge.  The failure of defence counsel
    to object more frequently, however, must be considered in light of the fact
    that the prior defence counsel had withdrawn from the file due to acrimony
    with the trial judge and the trial judge made sarcastic and derogatory comments
    about prior counsel intermittently during the course of the trial.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    way of illustrating the general situation, we have selected certain interventions
    by the trial judge which arose during the evidence of Mr. Stucky and a defence
    expert witness respecting whether the IMF promotion was intended to deliberately
    mislead the public into thinking the material received was connected with
    the government or the International Monetary Fund.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Stucky testified at trial that he did not intend the content of the IMF promotion
    to be misleading to its recipients, but rather that the choice was a “play
    on words” to get the readers’ attention.  He testified further that his belief
    that the promotion was not misleading was supported by the legal opinions
    of his lawyer, who advised him that it complied with the <i>Competition Act</i>.  The
    trial judge intervened during Mr. Stucky’s examination-in-chief and used
    sarcasm to suggest that he thought Mr. Stucky’s evidence preposterous.  Thus,
    at an early stage, the trial judge’s comments suggest that he had already
    discounted Mr. Stucky’s credibility:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Well, rather than asking him the specific question,
    what was your intention, maybe just elicit the evidence.  I mean, you may
    feel it’s necessary to elicit those self-serving comments: no, I didn’t intend
    to mislead, no, I always intended to conform.  I’m going to take that evidence
    as a given, that the evidence is there.  Whether I conclude that evidence
    is there is another matter.  That’s clearly to be drawn from the surrounding
    facts.  <i>I have no doubt that Mr. Stucky is going to come in here and tell
    me with respect to each of the promotions, gosh, I never intended to mislead,
    gosh, I never thought those people would think that I, International Monetary
    Funding would be IMF, even though I used the initials IMF 65 times in each
    of my documents.</i> [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    the cross-examination of Mr. Stucky by Crown counsel, notably after Crown
    counsel expressly indicated that he was finished dealing with the IMF promotion
    and was ready to proceed to another area, the trial judge intervened to cross-examine
    Mr. Stucky as to the use of the acronym
    “IMF” in the IMF promotion.  During the course of this questioning, the trial
    judge expressed disbelief respecting Mr. Stucky’s evidence.  In addition,
    the trial judge cut off Mr. Stucky’s responses and offered his own thoughts
    on the matter:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>The Court: </b>Hold on a second.  Are you staying
    with the IMF?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Mr. Sutton (Crown Counsel): </b>No, sir.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>The Court: </b>You’re going to move on?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Mr Sutton: </b>I was going to move on.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>The Court: </b>Then I’m confused.  The IMF was
    complaining about the fact that you were, from their perspective, trading
    on their name and goodwill, basically.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>The Witness: </b>Trademark, yeah.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>The Court: </b>You were using their mark.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>The Witness: </b>Yeah.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>The Court: </b>Say what you will, my take on
    it was that that was purposeful, that wasn’t happenstance.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>The Witness: </b>Well – </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>The Court: </b>I mean, anybody with more than
    a Grade 10 education knows that the IMF stands for International Monetary
    Fund.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>The Witness: </b>There’s no question that that
    familiarity was meant to –<i> </i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>The Court: </b>It wasn’t just a play-on-words
    joke.  It was done purposely, was it not?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>The Witness: </b>It was done purposely, but
    there were multiple objectives to it.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>The Court: </b>I’m not saying there wasn’t,
    and I’m not saying it wasn’t good business, and I’m not saying it’s illegal.  I’m
    just –
    simply put, it was done purposely.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>The Witness: </b>Yes.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    addition to cutting off Mr. Stucky in mid-sentence above, and thereby not
    giving him an opportunity to convey his evidence in his own way, the mere
    asking of these questions by the trial judge at the end of Crown counsel’s
    cross-examination in respect of the IMF promotion could create the impression
    that the trial judge was endeavouring to buttress the Crown’s case by eliciting
    additional incriminatory evidence in an area which Crown counsel clearly
    had not pressed in cross-examination.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s premature determination of Mr. Stucky’s credibility is further
    reflected in the following exchange with defence counsel.  The trial judge
    had, on his own initiative, used the Internet to research and find a website
    showing the flags of the G-7 countries which he mentioned to counsel.  He
    was then placed in the position of having to rule on the submissions of defence
    counsel regarding the admissibility of the website image of the flags of
    the G-7 countries. </p>

lang=EN-US>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Again,
    the trial judge used sarcasm to convey his disbelief of Mr. Stucky’s evidence
    but this time he went further:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>The Court: </b>…And rather than being cute,
    I mean, I did find the official website.  The fact of the matter is he’s
    using it to show the flags, the configuration of the flags, the use of the
    flags, which I said to Mr. Stucky was done purposefully. <i> And he gave
    me some malarkey about the fact that he couldn’t recognize the flags.  A
    Grade 6 student could recognize the flags…The point of the exercise is that
    he purposely flagged this in the same order that the G7 flags are out there.</i>  He…used
    the IMF moniker, the fact that the matter is he had G-&amp; Sector – Sector
    G-7 on his envelope.  They weren’t done coincidently and as a parody, they
    were done to create the – using Jacobs’ terms – the official aspect.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Mr. Porter: </b>Well, Mr. Stucky’s evidence
    was to give an international flavour.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>The Court: </b><i>That’s his evidence, Mr. Porter.</i>  <i>I
      don’t accept his evidence.</i> [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Prior
    to the end of trial, the trial judge indicated to the Crown that it did not
    need to vigorously pursue further the issue of the admissibility of the website
    of the G7 flags:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>The Court:</b> …I’ve already got my own view
    of Mr. Stucky’s recollection of the flags and his use of the flags.  And

lang=EN-US>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When
    the Crown led evidence that Mr. Stucky’s use of the acronym IMF was challenged
    by the International Monetary Fund and legal action against him was threatened
    in September 1998, the trial judge further cross-examined Mr. Stucky and
    obtained admissions from him that, while he had ceased this promotion, he
    delayed in responding and that the longer the promotion continued the better
    it was for him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    well, the trial judge inappropriately cross-examined the defence witness
    Ronald Jacobs, an American expert on direct marketing, on his evidence that
    the recipient would know the IMF promotion was not from a government organization.  Additionally,
    the trial judge attempted to make Jacobs change the thrust of his evidence. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Early
    in the examination-in-chief of Mr. Jacobs, the trial judge made the following
    sarcastic remarks:</p>

    your AK-47s at the same store?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>The Witness:</b> I hope not.</p>

    Crown submits that on a consideration of the trial as a whole, no reasonable,

    of the appearance of an unfair trial. </p>

lang=EN-US>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    acknowledge that at various points during the trial, the trial judge indicated
    he maintained an open mind.  He also generally asked counsel if they had
    any questions arising out of the interventions.  Unfortunately, in our view,
    the above examples illustrate that a reasonable observer would conclude that
    the appearance of fairness of the trial was undermined. </p>

lang=EN-US>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    support of its submission that the trial judge made significant efforts to
    maintain an open mind and demonstrated impartiality throughout the trial
    proceedings, the Crown relies on the following comment by the trial judge
    made during closing argument:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>The Court: </b>I’m not saying I don’t believe
    Mr. Stucky.  And I want him to understand, <i>but for that flag incident, </i>Mr
    Stucky gave – and maybe one or two other things

    saying that in a pejorative fashion. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Contrary
    to the Crown’s submission, the extract relied upon illustrates that the trial
    judge never waivered with respect to his initial opinion of Mr. Stucky’s
    credibility on an important aspect concerning the defence.  The Crown could
    point to no authority where appearing to prejudge the credibility of an accused
    has been condoned by an appellate court. </p>

    trial judge’s conduct towards the defence.
     It is the accused who is in danger of losing his liberty or being sanctioned
    if found guilty at trial.  As we have already emphasized, prudence and judicial
    restraint must be greater where the accused takes the stand: <i>Brouillard </i>at

    Crown is not an ordinary litigant:  see <i>R. v. McNeil</i>, [2009] S.C.J.
    No. 3, at para. 49.  In prosecuting those alleged to have committed a crime,
    the Crown represents the public interest.  The Crown’s role as representative
    of the public interest is part of the larger obligation it has to the due
    administration of justice.  The Crown and the defence are not adverse in
    interest insofar as the due administration of justice is concerned.  Rather,
    both have an interest in ensuring that justice be done and be seen to be
    done. </p>

    para. 27 of the reasons, the trial judge summarised the applicable legal
    principles for pre-1999 offences, stating:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There is no issue between the parties that the
    Crown is obliged to prove each and every element of the offence beyond a
    reasonable doubt.  There is also no issue that before the 1999 Amendments,
    the charging section created a strict liability offence which gave rise to
    both a statutory (s. 60(2) of the <i>Competition Act</i>) and common law
    due diligence defence, which for the purposes of this prosecution, are essentially
    the same.  In that respect, the defendant may demonstrate, on a balance of
    probabilities, that:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>he
    took all reasonable steps to avoid the particular event complained of; or</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>reasonably
    believed in a mistaken set of facts, which if true, would render the act
    or omission innocent.[Citations omitted.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    lynchpin of Mr. Stucky’s defence in respect to the pre-1999 alleged offences
    was that he had obtained legal advice about the promotions and, having followed
    that advice, he reasonably believed that they complied with the legislation.  This,
    it was argued, brought Mr. Stucky within the second component of the due
    diligence defence, namely, that he had a reasonable belief in a mistaken
    set of facts that, if true, would render his conduct innocent.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge held that Mr. Stucky’s conduct met neither component of the due
    diligent defence.  He concluded that Mr. Stucky’s reliance on his lawyer’s
    advice, in addition to the other steps he said he had taken, was not sufficient
    to amount to having taken all reasonable steps, nor did it amount to a mistaken
    set of facts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    appeal, Mr. Stucky submits that the trial judge made a number of errors in
    concluding that the due diligence defence had not been made out.  The alleged
    errors are based on the trial judge’s evidentiary determinations and the
    application of the law to facts as he found them.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown argues that the trial judge erred in holding that Mr. Stucky could
    advance a mistake of fact defence based on the legal advice he received.  The
    Crown contends that such a mistake is a mistake of law and, consequently,
    the second arm of the due diligence defence based on mistake of fact was
    not available to Mr. Stucky.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    our conclusion that this matter must be retried, it is not necessary or appropriate
    to deal with the grounds raised by Mr. Stucky and we decline to so do.  As
    the matter raised by the Crown is a question of law, however, there is utility
    in deciding it at this stage of the proceedings.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, there can be no doubt that reliance on a lawyer’s advice is a mistake
    of law which affords no defence to the commission of an offence.  Accordingly,
    we do not view Mr. Stucky’s reliance on legal advice as a matter properly
    considered under the second branch of the due diligence defence.    </p>

    and a mistake of law in this way:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>As a general rule, a mistake of fact, which includes
    ignorance of fact, exists when an accused is mistaken in his belief that
    certain facts exist when they do not, or that certain facts do not exist
    when they do.  Ignorance of fact exists when an accused has no knowledge
    of a matter and no actual belief or suspicion as to the true state of the
    matter.  By contrast, a mistake of law exists when the mistake relates not
    to the actual facts but rather to their legal effect.<a

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Professor
    Don Stuart explains the distinction in a similar fashion in <i>Canadian Criminal
    Law:
     A Treatise</i>, 5th ed. (
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto: Carswell, 2007), at p. 366:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A mistake of fact is said to occur when the accused
    is mistaken in his belief that facts exist when they do not, or that they
    do not exist when they do.  On the other hand, a mistake of law is said to
    occur when the mistake is not as to the actual facts but rather as to their
    legal relevance, consequence or significance.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[112]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is clear in this case that Mr. Stucky’s actions were not undertaken based
    on any misapprehension of the facts, as he knew the content and make-up of
    each promotion, but, rather, in reliance on his lawyer’s opinion of the publications
    and/or representations.  That is a mistake as to the legal significance or
    consequences of his actions and, accordingly, is a mistake of law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[113]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> There
    is a significant body of case law that establishes that an accused cannot
    rely on legal advice as a defence.  In <i>R. v. Pontes</i>, [1995] 3 S.C.R.
    44, at paras. 33-34, Cory J. writing for the majority, affirmed this principle:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[I]t is important to remember the well-established
    principle, incorporated in s. 19 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C., 1985,
    c. C-46, that a mistake of law is no excuse…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The application of this principle leads to the
    conclusion that an accused cannot put forward as a defence that he made diligent
    inquiries as to the legality of his actions or status.  The submission of
    such a defence was specifically rejected in <i>Molis v. The Queen</i>, [1980]
    2 S.C.R. 356.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[114]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R.
      v. Whelan</i> (2002), 219 Nfld. &amp; P.E.I.R. 52 (Nfld. C.A.), Roberts
      J.A. remarked that the most common argument of accused persons, in asserting
      that acting on their lawyer’s advice should be a valid defence, is that
      they were unaware that the act they committed was unlawful.  In rejecting
      this contention, Roberts J.A. stated, at para. 9:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If a court were to accept this argument, however,
    a mistake of law would constitute a valid defence and accuseds would have
    to know that the act they were committing was unlawful in order for the Crown
    to obtain a conviction.  This argument displaces the mental element of the
    offence, suggesting that it should relate to the legality of the act and
    not to the act itself.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Whelan</i>,
    the accused had been charged with disobeying a court order.  The accused
    asserted that he relied on his lawyer’s opinion regarding the meaning of
    the order.  Roberts J.A. found that the actions of the accused in disobeying
    the order were undertaken not based on any mistake as to the facts, but rather
    in reliance on his lawyer’s incorrect advice.  He held that the error was
    a mistake of law and could not constitute a valid defence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[116]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    decision of this court in <i>R. v. Dalley</i> (1957), 8 D.L.R. (2d) 179 is
    to the same effect.  In <i>Dalley</i>, the accused was convicted at trial
    of trading in securities without being registered as a broker under the <i>Ontario
    Securities Act, </i>R.S.O. 1950, c. 351.<i>  </i>The accused argued on appeal
    that his solicitor had advised him that his actions did not amount to an
    offence because he was not trading in “securities” within the meaning of
    the statute.  He contended that, based on the advice he had received from
    his lawyer, he did not believe he was doing anything contrary to the law
    and thus he had to be acquitted.  In rejecting this submission, this court
    stated, at p. 186:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Here, the appellant knew, as his counsel conceded,
    that he was not registered under the Act and that he “traded” in his dealings
    with Johnson.  These, of course, were questions of fact.  To say that he
    did not know that what he dealt with or traded in was a security within the
    meaning of the Act, amounts to an assertion that he was mistaken about a
    question of law.  If true, and I do not doubt it, it affords the appellant
    no defence, in my opinion. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly,
    in <i>R. v. Maunder</i>, [1966] 1 C.C.C. 328 (Ont. Mag. Ct.), conviction
    affirmed, [1966] 1 C.C.C. 328 (C.A.), the trial judge held, at p. 379, that “[a]
    mistake of law cannot afford a defence even where the accused sought a lawyer’s
    opinion and acted on it.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[118]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    conclude on this point, we echo the following comment of McClung J.A. in <i>R.
    v. Kotch</i> (1990), 114 A.R. 11 (C.A.), at p. 15, “[a]bsent ‘officially-induced
    error,’
    mistaken legal advice does not shield the purposeful doing of an act which
    may prove contrary to the criminal law.”</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>2)        The post-1999 alleged
      offences</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[119]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    ease of reference, the post-1999 version of s. 52 is set out again.  It reads
    as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><a name="anchorse:52-ss:_1_"></a>(1) No person
    shall, for the purpose of promoting, directly or indirectly, the supply or
    use of a product or for the purpose of promoting, directly or indirectly,
    any business interest, by any means whatever, knowingly or recklessly make
    a representation to the public that is false or misleading in a material
    respect. <a name=P272></a><a name="anchorse:52-ss:_1_1_"></a></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=indentlabel> (1.1)</span> For greater
    certainty, in establishing that subsection (1) was contravened, it is not
    necessary to prove that any person was deceived or misled. <a name=P273></a><a
name="anchorse:52-ss:_1_2_"></a></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[120]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge explained the difference in the <i>mens rea </i>requirements
    pre- and post-1999 at para. 84 of the reasons: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>As indicated in Part I, s. 52 created a “strict
    liability” offence before the 1999 Amendments, and an offence requiring proof
    of the accused’s <i>mens rea</i>, thereafter.  The essence of the distinction
    between these two types of offences has long been established in the oft-quoted
    decision of Dickson J. in <i>R. v. Sault Ste. Marie (City)</i>:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>I conclude, for the reasons which I have sought
    to express, that there are compelling grounds for the recognition of three
    categories of offences rather than the traditional two:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>1.  Offences in which <i>mens rea</i>, consisting
    of some positive state of mind such as intent, knowledge, or recklessness,
    must be proved by the prosecution either as an inference from the nature
    of the act committed, or by additional evidence.</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>2.  Offences in which there is no necessity
    for the prosecution to prove the existence of <i>mens rea</i>; the doing
    of the prohibited act <i>prima facie </i>imports the offence, leaving it
    open to the accused to avoid liability by proving that  he took all reasonable
    care.  This involves consideration of what a reasonable man would have done
    in the circumstances.  The defence will be available if the accused reasonably
    believed in a mistaken set of fact which, if true, would render the act or
    omission innocent, or if he took all reasonable steps to avoid the particular
    event.  These offences may properly be called offences of strict liability.

    or was reckless in that regard.  <span class=hit1><span style='color:windowtext;

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[122]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown contends that the trial judge erred in concluding that, in order to
    satisfy the <i>mens rea</i> component of s. 52, the Crown had to show knowledge
    of, or recklessness with respect to, the false or misleading character of
    the promotions in fact.  The Crown argues that all that is required is proof
    that Mr. Stucky knew (1) the content and make-up of the promotional pieces
    and (2) the truth regarding them, including how the promotions actually functioned.  On
    this view, it is not necessary for the Crown to prove that Mr. Stucky knew
    or was reckless as to whether the promotional materials were misleading.  The
    Crown says that requiring it to prove that Mr. Stucky knew or was reckless
    as to whether the representations were misleading imposes an unnecessary
    burden on the Crown.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[123]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown’s position on <i>mens rea</i> effectively makes the post-1999 offence
    indistinguishable from the strict liability offence, as it requires only
    that Mr. Stucky knew the contents of the promotions and knew the truth regarding
    them, not that he also had to know or be reckless as to whether they were,
    in fact, misleading.  We do not accept that submission.  In our view, the
    trial judge’s articulation of the <i>mens rea</i> requirement for post-1999
    s. 52 offences is correct.  That interpretation best accords with the change
    from a strict liability offence to one requiring <i>mens rea</i>.  It is
    also consistent with the case law on the “knowingly” standard in other regulatory
    contexts, and the objectives of s. 52 as a criminal provision. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[124]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Three
    examples of the case law will suffice.  In <i>Mac’s Liquid</i>, this court
    concluded that the phrase “knowingly give false information” in the <i>Environmental
    Protection Act</i>, R.S.O. 1980, c. 141, s. 145, required the accused to
    know a statement was false.  An honest belief in the truth of the statement
    was held to be a defence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[125]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Anderson</i>,
    the Divisional Court considered s. 22 of the <i>Consumer Reporting Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. C.33, which prohibits a person from “knowingly” supplying
    false or misleading information, and s. 28(10)(c) of the <i>Collections Agencies
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.14, which makes it an offence for a person to “knowingly”
    contravene the Act and regulations.  The court held that these provisions
    require that the person making a report know that the information is false.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[126]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    in <i>Bhatty</i>, the court found that the offence of “knowingly furnishing
    false information”
    under s. 97 of the <i>Insurance Act</i>, R.S.O. 1980, c. 218, required the
    Crown to prove that the accused had knowledge of the falsity of the information.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[127]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    more stringent <i>mens rea </i>requirement is appropriate given that the
    post-1999 prohibition on false and misleading advertising is designed to
    catch serious criminal conduct.  In <i>Benlolo</i>, Feldman J.A., writing
    for the court, emphasized this point at paras. 19 and 29:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In deciding that a substantial sentence of incarceration
    was warranted and appropriate in this case, the trial judge distinguished
    the pre-1999 case law.  She concluded that in making the amendments, Parliament
    intended that serious, egregious cases that had the hallmarks of fraud would
    be treated as criminal matters, while the cases that were more akin to sharp
    practice could be processed through the new civil stream.  I agree with the
    trial judge that the 1999 amendments constitute a watershed in the treatment
    and approach to misleading advertising and that the pre-1999 case law must
    therefore be viewed with caution.</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In 1999, Parliament amended the legislation to
    give the Competition Bureau more tools to use and more flexibility in its
    choice of enforcement mechanisms to combat new forms of misleading advertising
    including large-scale fraudulent schemes.  It now had civil remedies that
    were more easily obtainable to deal with persons whose activities could be
    curbed and regulated through directives that would protect the public without
    the need to engage in the acrimonious, time-consuming and onerous criminal
    prosecution process.  On the other hand, the criminal offence was changed
    from a strict liability offence to one of full <i>mens rea</i>, that is,
    where the deception is done knowingly or with reckless disregard of the consequences.</p>

    understand the concern which underpins the Crown’s position on this matter,
    namely, that an accused’s knowledge of whether a representation is misleading
    is not readily susceptible of proof.  In response to that concern, we commend
    the commonsensical approach of the Federal Court of Appeal in

    <i> (Attorney General) v. Gates </i>(1995), 125 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 348.  In <i>Gates</i>,
    the court applied <i>Mac’s Liquid </i>at p. 350 in concluding that making
    a statement, representation, or furthering information that a claimant “knew
    to be false or misleading” under s. 33(1) of the <i>Unemployment Insurance
    Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. U-1 required that a claimant knowingly “misrepresent” facts.  At
    p. 350-51 of <i>Gates</i>, the court stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In deciding whether there was subjective knowledge
    by a claimant, however, the commission or board may take into account common
    sense and objective factors.  In other words, if a claimant claims to be
    ignorant of something that the whole world knows, the fact finder could rightly
    disbelieve that claimant and find that there was, in fact, subjective knowledge,
    despite the denial.  Not to know the obvious, therefore, might properly lead
    to an inference that the claimant is lying.  This does not make the test
    objective; it does, however, take into account objective matters in coming
    to a decision on subjective knowledge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[129]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    conclusion, in our view, to satisfy the <i>mens rea </i>component of s. 52
    offences post-1999, the Crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that an
    accused had knowledge of the false or misleading character of the representations,
    or was reckless in that regard.     </p>
