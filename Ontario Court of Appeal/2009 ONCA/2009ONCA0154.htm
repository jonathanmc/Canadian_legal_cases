line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>            The
    appellant was convicted by Grossi J. of four counts of possession of counterfeit
    money and of instruments for making counterfeit money. She was acquitted
    of two counts of making counterfeit money.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was charged with numerous counts, including conspiracy to make
    and possess counterfeit money, making counterfeit money, and possession of
    both counterfeit money and instruments to make counterfeit money as well
    as possession of credit cards obtained by crime. During the trial, the conspiracy
    charges and the possession of credit card charges were dismissed. In his
    reasons for judgment, the trial judge dealt only with the charges of possession
    of instruments for making counterfeit money, possession of counterfeit money
    and making counterfeit money. He found that there was no evidence linking
    the appellant to the making of the counterfeit money, and acquitted her of
    that charge. He convicted her on the two possession charges.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s reasons are structured as a colloquy between the arguments
    of the Crown and of the defence. He makes few specific findings of fact.
    After reviewing the arguments of each side, he concludes that
    “there is sufficient evidence to establish the elements of the offence of
    possession beyond a reasonable doubt.” The sentencing hearing was held a
    few weeks later, at which the trial judge delivered reasons for sentence,
    expanding on his conclusions regarding the appellant’s level of involvement
    in the counterfeiting operation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>            In
    his reasons for judgment convicting the appellant of the possession charges,
    the trial judge made the following findings: He referred to the appellant
    as the wife of Miroslav Mihalkov, who was one of the parties to a large counterfeiting
    operation. She resided with him in an apartment at
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    25 Cosburn Ave. in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Toronto and was aware that counterfeit money was being manufactured there.
    She did not report the operation to the police because she did not want to
    inform on her husband. She was not oppressed by her husband, and was free
    to work and to leave the apartment at will. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the end of the reasons, the trial judge explained the basis for acquitting
    the appellant of the charge of making counterfeit money. He found that the
    fact that she resided at 25 Cosburn Ave. where the counterfeiting equipment
    and operation were found and she knew about them, that several of the computers
    were registered to her, and that she had extensive training in the Adobe
    Photoshop software program that is commonly used to produce counterfeit money,
    were not sufficient to establish that she participated in making the counterfeit
    money.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his reasons for sentence on the possession charges, the trial judge summarized
    his conclusions regarding the appellant’s possession as follows: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>During the relevant
    period, Maria was married to Miroslav Mihalkov. They shared an apartment
    at
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    25 Cosburn Avenue. Miroslav was the main party in this large sophisticated
    counterfeit operation, and, in the Reasons for Judgment, I reviewed the items
    found in the apartment relating to the counterfeit operation. There was no
    evidence linking Maria to the manufacturing of the counterfeit money. <i>She
    became involved through her knowledge of the operation and control in allowing
    the situation to continue. </i>She did make an effort to absent herself from
    the apartment, however, she never finalized it. She had no contact with the
    other two locations. She did not take part in the sale and there is a question
    as to the length of her awareness of the operation. … She was discontent
    with the living arrangements and tried to remedy this by requesting Mr. Mihalkov’s
    friends to move out with no result. In fairness, given her background and
    dependence on Miroslav, she was in a tight spot. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <h3 align=left style='text-align:left'>The Test for ‘Possession’</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>            There
    was no dispute that the appellant’s husband was in possession of all the
    equipment and the counterfeit money. The issue before the court was whether
    the appellant was also in possession. The Crown relied on s. 4(3)(b) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>, which provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>4(3) For the
    purposes of this Act,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(<i>b</i>) where
    one of two or more persons, with the knowledge  and consent of the rest,
    has anything in his custody or possession, it shall be deemed to be in the
    custody and possession of each and all of them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>            The
    trial judge referred to the important decision of the Supreme Court of Canada
    in <i>R. v. Terrence,</i> [1983] 1 S.C.R. 357, where the court held that “a
    constituent and essential element of possession under s. 3(4)(b) [now s.
    4(3)(b)] of the <i>Criminal Code</i> is a measure of control on the part
    of the person deemed to be in possession by that provision of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>” (p. 364). The Supreme Court quoted with approval in the same decision,
    at p. 363, the following explanation of the section by O’Halloran J.A. of
    the British Columbia Court of Appeal in <i>R. v. Colvin and Gladue</i> (1942),
    78 C.C.C. 282, at p. 287:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The “knowledge
    and consent” which is an integral element of joint possession in s. 5(2)
    [now 4(3)(b)] must be related to and read with the definition of “possession” in
    the previous section 5(1)(b) [now 4(3)(a)]. It follows that “knowledge and
    consent”
    cannot exist without the co-existence of some measure of control over the
    subject-matter. If there is the power to consent there is equally the power
    to refuse and vice versa. They each signify the existence of some power or
    authority which is here called control, without which the need for their
    exercise could not arise or be invoked.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>            Since <i>Terrence</i>,
    it has been understood that in order for a person to be in “constructive
    possession” under s. 4(3)(b), the person must have knowledge that the other
    person is in possession of the contraband, must consent to that possession,
    and in order to give effective consent that imports criminal liability, the
    person must have a measure of control over the contraband.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>            For
    example, in <i>R. v. Chalk</i> (2007), 88 O.R. (3d) 448 (C.A.), the accused
    was convicted of possession of child pornography that was stored on the hard
    drive of a computer kept in the living room of the home occupied by the accused,
    his girlfriend and her two children. Following his arrest regarding an allegation
    made against him by the girlfriend’s daughter, the accused had a phone conversation
    with his girlfriend from custody in which he asked his girlfriend to delete
    his files from the computer before the police could search it. She looked
    into his folder on the hard drive and discovered some pornographic images
    involving children, which she showed to the police. A further search of the
    hard drive disclosed pornographic movies involving children in another folder.
    It was unclear from the evidence who had downloaded or viewed the child pornography,
    although the accused acknowledged that he knew it was there but denied knowingly
    downloading it. It had been viewed while he was in custody by someone other
    than the police.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge convicted the accused of possession of child pornography on the
    basis that the accused knew it was stored on the computer and attempted to
    exercise control over it by asking his girlfriend to delete it. In this court,
    Doherty J.A. stated at para. 19:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Knowledge alone
    will not establish possession. The Crown must also prove that an accused
    with the requisite knowledge had a measure of control over the item in issue.
    Control refers to power or authority over the item whether exercised or not: <i>R
    v. Mohamad</i> (2004), 69 O.R. (3d) 481… (
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), at paras. 60-61.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    accused argued that his assertion of control by asking his girlfriend to
    delete his computer files amounted to “innocent possession” for the purpose
    only of divesting himself of the contraband. Doherty J.A. agreed that where
    a person “takes control of contraband exclusively for the purpose of immediately
    destroying the contraband or otherwise placing it permanently beyond that
    person’s ability to exercise any control over the contraband…the intention
    is solely to divest oneself of control rather than to possess” (para. 25).
    However, he concluded that this was not one of those cases, because the accused
    had had control over the material for several months and could have deleted
    it at any time before he was arrested. His control was therefore “not merely
    incidental to an innocent purpose” (para. 26).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the present case, much of the focus of the evidence, the submissions and
    the reasons of the trial judge was on whether the appellant resided at
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    25 Cosburn Ave. The trial judge concluded that she did. The Crown submitted
    that because the appellant was living at
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    25 Cosburn Ave. and knew her husband was using their apartment to make counterfeit
    money, she allowed this activity to continue and was therefore in possession.
    The Crown also submitted that because the appellant was living at
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    25 Cosburn Ave., she was in control of the premises.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    latter submission was consistent with the trial judge’s reference to this
    court’s decision in <i>Re Chambers and the Queen</i> (1985), 20 C.C.C. (3d)
    440, which he said stands for the proposition that: “[t]he requisite control
    can be found in the fact that a prohibited item or contraband is in an accused’s
    home and that she had the right to grant or withhold her consent to the property
    being stored there.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    there is a major difference between this case and <i>Chambers.</i> In <i>Chambers</i>,
    the apartment belonged to the accused, who allowed her boyfriend to stay
    with her and to keep his drugs there. Because it was her apartment, she controlled
    who was there and in that way, what they brought with them. In this case,
    the appellant lived in the apartment rented by her husband. Even if she had
    a joint legal right to stay in the premises, so did her husband. On the evidence
    accepted by the trial judge, she did not have sole legal control nor any
    factual control over who was in the apartment or what they brought in.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Application
      of the Test by the Trial Judge</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    appears from reading the reasons as a whole, that the trial judge accepted
    the Crown’s final argument that it was the combination of the fact that the
    appellant resided at the premises, knew what was going on and did not call
    the police that showed that she had control over the premises. He accepted
    that her control over the contraband could be inferred from her knowledge
    and because she <i>chose</i> not to call the police as opposed to being <i>prevented
    from</i> calling the police by her husband.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    finding constitutes an error in law. There was no obligation in law for the
    appellant to call the police to report illegal activity. Nor can a failure
    to call police indicate any measure of control. Anyone may call police and
    report criminal activity. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the trial judge erred in concluding that because the appellant remained
    in the apartment with knowledge of the counterfeiting activity and did not
    call the police, that she therefore had sufficient control to withhold her
    consent. These factual findings are insufficient to ground the legal conclusion
    that the appellant had “power or authority over” the counterfeit money and
    equipment (<i>Chalk</i> at para. 19). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    most that can be said from this evidence and the reasons of the trial judge
    is that, by staying in the apartment in those circumstances, the appellant
    acquiesced in her husband’s illegal conduct. This is not a case like <i>Chalk</i>,<i> </i>where
    the accused had physical control over the material stored on the computer
    hard drive and the ability to delete it, and therefore to choose to retain
    it. The counterfeiting equipment did not belong to the appellant.  Her husband
    and his two friends controlled the equipment. There was no evidence that
    her consent was either sought or required, nor did the trial judge so find.
    The fact that the indication of control relied on by the Crown and the trial
    judge was the appellant’s failure to call the police demonstrates an acknowledgement
    that she had no actual control either over the contraband or over the premises.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
    the trial judge found was that she had control over herself. She could come
    and go into and from the apartment “on her own accord”. She was allowed to
    go out to work. One could therefore conclude that she could have disassociated
    herself from the illegal activity by not returning to the apartment. However,
    the fact that she maintained residence in the apartment does not mean that
    she thereby gained control over the contraband. The only suggestion of what
    she could have done about the situation was to call the police. Indeed, in
    his reasons for sentence, the trial judge recognized that the appellant was “in
    a tight spot.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his reasons, Doherty J.A. considers that it was reasonable for the trial
    judge to infer from the evidence that the appellant lived in the apartment
    for six weeks, knew about the counterfeiting operation, did not call the
    police, used some of the computers and fled the scene when the police arrested
    her husband, that she had constructive possession of the equipment and the
    counterfeit money (para. 5). However, from my reading of the reasons, the
    trial judge did not draw an inference from these circumstances that the appellant
    had control. Rather, based on his reasons for judgment and for sentence,
    it appears that the trial judge’s conclusion that she “allowed this activity
    to continue” was made, not by drawing an inference of control from the facts,
    but on his belief that despite the fact that the appellant was “in a tight
    spot”, the combination of her continued residence, her knowledge of the presence
    of the contraband, and her failure to call the police amounted to control <i>in
    law</i>, for the purpose of constructive possession. </p>

    the close of the Crown’s case, the appellant’s counsel moved for a directed
    verdict of acquittal on the possession charges. In his reasons for rejecting
    the motion, the trial judge referred to the appellant’s argument that the
    trial judge should apply an old common law presumption that where a husband
    and wife live together, the husband is in control of the premises. In response,
    the Crown suggested, referring to the decision of the Ontario Court of Justice
    in <i>R. v. Mehrabnia</i> (1993), O.J. No. 2819, that there is now a rebuttable
    presumption that in those circumstances a husband and wife have joint control.
    In his reasons for dismissing the motion, the trial judge rejected the old
    presumption. He did not make any finding regarding a new, rebuttable presumption.</p>

    in his reasons for judgment, the trial judge noted that the Crown again submitted
    that there may now be a rebuttable presumption of law that when a husband
    and wife live together, both have joint possession and control of the premises
    and the property. As the trial judge made no specific findings in his reasons
    for judgment as to which of the Crown’s submissions he accepted, it is unclear
    whether he gave any effect to this alleged presumption. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    my view, it is important to state that the law regarding the elements of
    the offence of possession applies equally to all persons, regardless of their
    marital status. Where the Crown relies on
    “constructive possession” under s. 4(3)(b) of the <i>Code</i>, it must prove
    knowledge, consent and an element of control over the contraband. </p>

    partners are living together, whether they are married, common law spouses
    or even roommates, they each have the right to live in the premises. Depending
    on the conduct of the partner who does not own the contraband, it may be
    open to a court to infer consent and a measure of control over the contraband
    by the other partner. However, particularly where partners are married or
    in a common law relationship where there may be a power imbalance (as there
    was in this case), that inference does not automatically arise only on the
    basis that the partner not responsible for the contraband continued to reside
    in the joint premises with knowledge of the presence of the contraband and
    did not call the police. </p>

    live at 25 Cosburn Ave., the appellant’s failure to call the police meant
    that she had a measure of control over the counterfeiting equipment and the
    counterfeit money sufficient to constitute constructive possession within
    the meaning of s. 4(3)(b) of the <i>Code</i>. The trial judge made no other
    finding of control of the contraband. Based on the error of law, I would

    the end of the appellant’s evidence, this was a straightforward, one issue
    case.  The appellant’s husband, with her full knowledge, was running a large
    scale counterfeit money making factory in their small one bedroom apartment.  The
    police conducted a “sting” operation that eventually led to the arrest of
    the husband and the search of the apartment.  The police found copious amounts
    of counterfeit money, material used in the manufacture of counterfeit money
    and computers and other equipment (scanners, printers, etc.) that were being
    used to manufacture counterfeit money in the appellant’s residence.  </p>

line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant testified that she became aware of her husband’s counterfeit money
    making operation about six weeks before the police raid when she returned
    from a visit to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Europe.  The appellant found the apartment full of computer and other equipment
    being used to manufacture counterfeit money.  She testified that she had
    nothing to do with the operation, which was being run by her husband and
    a friend.  According to the appellant’s testimony, she told her husband to
    remove the material from their residence but he refused.  The appellant also
    testified that her marriage was an unhappy one and that she wanted to leave
    the residence but had nowhere to go.</p>

    trial judge concluded that the Crown had failed to prove that the appellant
    was a party to the counterfeit money manufacturing operation being run by
    her husband.  With respect to the possession charges, the trial judge properly
    identified s. 4(3)(b) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> as the operative provision.  He
    recognized that possession under that provision required an element of control
    over the property in issue.</p>

line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This

    made at trial against only the reasonableness standard set out in found in
    s. 686(1)(a)(i).  The trial judge’s findings of fact clear that hurdle.  The
    circumstances identified by him were all relevant to whether the appellant
    had an element of control over the counterfeit money and the equipment and
    material being used to manufacture that money.  </p>

    do not suggest that the inference drawn by the trial judge was the only available
    inference, or that the evidence was particularly strong.  Certainly, another
    trial judge, acting reasonably, could have concluded that the appellant’s
    failure to speak to the authorities and her flight at the time of arrest
    was consistent with concerns about her own welfare and did not support the
    inference that she had any control over the contraband material and equipment.  That
    is not, however, the inference that this trial judge chose to draw.  Assuming
    the inference he drew is one that a reasonable trier of fact could draw,
    and I think it was, it is his job and not the function of this court to determine
    what inference should be drawn.  </p>

line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    para. 17 of her reasons, my colleague states that because the appellant was
    not under a legal obligation to notify the authorities of the ongoing counterfeit
    operation being run out of her home, it was an error in law for the trial
    judge to draw an inference supporting possession against her based on her
    failure to notify the authorities.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    see no connection between the absence of any legal obligation to notify the
    authorities and the inference that the trial judge could reasonably draw
    from the appellant’s conduct, including her failure to go to the authorities
    during the six week time period.  Inferences from circumstances are drawn
    based on common sense and human experience.  I think a trier of fact, acting
    reasonably, could take the appellant’s failure throughout the six week period
    to notify the authorities of the ongoing criminal activity in her residence
    as some evidence of her condonation and consent to the property being used
    in that criminal activity remaining in her residence.  Certainly, the appellant’s
    failure to notify the authorities is conduct that is much more consistent
    with a person who is content to have the property in his or her residence,
    than with a person who (as the appellant testified) takes strong objection
    to the property remaining in her residence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    inference drawn by the trial judge has nothing to do with whether the appellant
    had any obligation to go to the authorities.  The inference flows from a
    determination, based on common sense and human experience, of how one expects
    people to act and react in a given set of circumstances.  The same reasoning
    applies to the inference to be drawn from the appellant’s flight from the
    apartment after she saw her husband arrested just outside.  That reaction,
    considered in the context of the rest of the evidence, could support an inference
    that the appellant was criminally complicit in at least some of the criminal
    activity going on within her home.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    inferences drawn by the trial judge cannot be confused with the impermissible
    inferences that are occasionally drawn against an arrested person who declines
    to offer any explanation for his conduct to the police.  None of the inferences
    drawn by this trial judge intruded upon the appellant’s right to silence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My
    colleague also indicates (at para. 18) that the trial judge erred when he
    inferred that the appellant’s continued residence in the apartment could
    support the conclusion that the appellant had the necessary control over
    the counterfeit money and related material and equipment.  My colleague maintains
    that the evidence could only support an inference of the appellant’s acquiescence
    in the husband’s possession.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    for reasons set out above, I do not think that the trial judge found that
    the appellant was in possession of the relevant material exclusively on the
    basis that she resided in the apartment where the property was found.  Her
    ongoing residence in that property was one of several circumstances relied
    on by the trial judge.  Second, I think the question of whether an inference
    of mere acquiescence or an inference of possession should be drawn, was a
    matter for the trial judge and not this court.  The distinction between those
    two inferences turns essentially on the weight that the trial judge chose
    to give to the combined effect of the circumstances as he found them to be.  That
    is what trial judges do.  This court must defer to that weighing process
    unless it produces an unreasonable result.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the trial judge did not ultimately rely on any presumption based on the spousal
    relationship between the appellant and her husband, he did make reference
    to certain cases which suggest there is some kind of rebuttable presumption.  I
    see no value in maintaining or creating artificial rebuttable presumptions
    to decide questions of possession.  Possession is a question of mixed fact
    and law.  It must be determined by the application of settled legal principles,
    including the reasonable doubt principle, to the evidence in any given case.  That
    evidence is infinitely variable.  Where the property in issue is found on
    premises owned and/or controlled by more than one party, the relationship
    between or among those parties, marital or otherwise, will be relevant in
    deciding the question of possession as it applies to each of the individuals
    separately.  That inquiry is not aided by judicially created presumptions,
    particularly ones that reflect long gone social stereotypes.  </p>
