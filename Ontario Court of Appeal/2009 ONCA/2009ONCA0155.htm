    is a long history of animosity between Universal Workers Union, Labourers’ International
    Union of North America, Local 183 (“Local 183”) and its international trade
    union parent, the Labourers’ International Union of North America (“LIUNA”).  The
    longstanding dispute centers on Local 183’s autonomy and jurisdiction.  A
    rival trade union, the Canadian Construction Workers Union (“CCWU”), has
    recently obtained certification status.  There is fierce and direct competition
    between the CCWU and LIUNA for the right to represent workers in the construction
    industry.  Many CCWU members are former members of Local 183.  </p>

    Dionisio, Dias and Ferreira (the “appellants”) are members of the CCWU.  They
    were previously members of LIUNA and of Local 183.   In addition, Dionisio
    and Dias had been members of Local 183’s Executive Board – Dionisio served
    as the business manager and Dias as the secretary-treasurer.  Ferreira had
    been employed by Local 183 as a business representative.  </p>

    183 is governed by the International Union Constitution and the Uniform Local
    Union Constitution (the “Local Constitution”) (together the “Constitutions”).  The
    Local Constitution is uniform to all local unions in LIUNA; no individual
    local union can amend or alter the Local Constitution.  Pursuant to article
    III, s. 3(b) of the Local Constitution and to the oath of office provided
    for in article XIII of the Local Constitution, the appellants agreed to abide
    by the Constitutions, and all the rules, regulations, policies, practices
    and lawful orders and decisions made pursuant to them.</p>

    terms of the Constitutions with which it conflicts. </p>

    investigated the affairs of Local 183 and took steps to have it placed in
    a trusteeship.  In April 2006, Canadian Independent Hearing Officer Brian
    Keller concluded that it should be placed in trusteeship.  LIUNA then took
    the matter to the Ontario Labour Relations Board (the “Board”) and, in a
    decision dated June 12, 2006, the Board held that LIUNA had established just
    cause to place Local 183 under trusteeship.  It also ordered that “[n]o action
    shall be taken by LIUNA to suspend or expel any of the present officers and/or
    staff of Local 183 from membership in Local 183 and LIUNA without leave of
    the Board”.  </p>

    a result of Local 183 being placed under trusteeship, the then existing Executive
    Board of Local 183, which included Dionisio and Dias, was removed from office.  Mr.
    Rick Weiss was appointed trustee for Local 183.</p>

    August 2, 2006, Weiss preferred charges against Dionisio and Dias (and others)
    for violating the Constitutions by their acts in connection with an alleged
    scheme to divide $5 million of funds from Local 183.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    September 18, 2006, Weiss preferred charges against Ferreira for violating
    the Local Constitution based on allegations that Ferreira misled a Local
    183 member into believing he was still a business representative after his
    employment at Local 183 had been terminated.  At the hearing, similar allegations
    were made in relation to a second member.  In both instances, it was alleged
    that as a result of Ferreira’s actions, the members were prevented from gaining
    employment for extended periods of time and suffered a loss of income.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pursuant
    to article XII, s. 3 of the Local Constitution, charges are to be heard by
    the members of the Executive Board.  However, if the Executive Board is disqualified,
    the General President is to refer the charges to an Independent Hearing Officer
    for decision and disposition or to the appropriate District Council for trial.  As
    Local 183 was in trusteeship at the time the charges were preferred with
    the result that there was no Executive Board, the General President referred
    the charges to Canadian Independent Hearing Officer Barry Stephens.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>CIHO
    Stephens held a hearing in respect of the charges against Dionisio and Dias
    on October 28, November 9, and November 18, 2006, and on the charges against
    Ferreira on January 21, and January 30, 2007.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the appellants each received notice of the proceedings before CIHO Stephens,
    they did not attend because, among other reasons: (1) they claimed that pursuant
    to the Board decision, the Board retained jurisdiction over disciplinary
    matters involving Local 183; and (2) they had serious concerns about the
    fairness of the hearings before CIHO Stephens.  The hearings proceeded in
    their absence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    January 5, 2007, CIHO Stephens released his decision with respect to Dionisio
    and Dias.  He found that $5 million belonging to Local 183 had been placed
    in trust with a law firm in 2003.  That law firm had returned the money to
    Local 183 and it had then been transferred to a second law firm to be held
    in trust.  The money had been earmarked to cover legal costs related to disputes
    that might develop between Local 183 and its parent, LIUNA.  CIHO Stephens
    found that there was nothing improper in establishing the fund because such
    disputes occur and where resolution is through litigation, the associated
    legal expenses are legitimate.  However, he also found that, unbeknownst
    to Local 183’s general membership, the retainer agreements with both law
    firms stipulated that if Dionisio and Dias were removed from their positions
    on Local 183’s Executive Board by LIUNA, control over the $5 million fund
    would leave Local 183 and pass to them personally, with Dionisio having primary
    control.  Accordingly, he held that Dionisio and Dias had breached their
    duties under the Constitutions.  He suspended Dionisio’s membership for one
    year and Dias’ membership for six months.  He also ordered Dionisio and Dias
    to each pay $10,000 to Local 183.  These were the costs that CIHO Stephens
    found were associated with the two retainer agreements and the efforts necessary
    to secure the return of the money.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    March 7, 2007, CIHO Stephens made another order in which he expelled the
    appellants, and others, from membership in LIUNA and in Local 183 because
    of their roles in establishing a rival union, the CCWU.  He found that all
    of the charged members had engaged in concerted, co-ordinated activity, in
    an open and public manner, to raid the membership of Local 183.  He recognized
    that the individuals in question had the right, in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario, to work on behalf of another union but held that they could not
    continue as LIUNA members while engaging in activities that undermined and
    weakened the union, and eroded the bargaining strength and security of those
    members who remained loyal to LIUNA.  He concluded that the actions of the
    charged members were contrary to the Local Constitution and the CEPC.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    March 26, 2007, CIHO Stephens released his decision with respect to Ferreira.  He
    found that Ferreira had breached the Local Constitution.  He suspended Ferreira
    from membership for six months and ordered him to pay a fine to Local 183
    equal to the amount of income lost by the two members.  He calculated the
    amount to be $26,838.88.  While the money was to be paid to Local 183, he
    ordered that it be paid in trust and Local 183 was to then pay the money
    to the injured members.  </p>

    183 brought applications under s. 50 of the <i>Arbitration Act, 1991</i>,
    S.O. 1991, c. 17 (the “<i>Arbitration Act</i>”)<i> </i>in which they sought
    to enforce the decisions rendered by CIHO Stephens on January 5, 2007, and
    March 26, 2007, (the
    “Stephens Decisions”) as arbitration awards.  The application in respect
    of Dionisio and Dias was heard as a companion case with the application in
    respect of Ferreira by Perell J. on December 7, 2007. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    judgments dated December 12, 2007, the applications judge granted the applications
    (the “Judgments”).  He reasoned that by becoming union members, the appellants
    were bound by the terms of the Local Constitution and under its terms, they
    impliedly or implicitly agreed to be bound by an “arbitration process” that
    yielded the Stephens Decisions.  He thus concluded that there was an arbitration
    agreement and that the Stephens Decisions constituted arbitration awards
    which are enforceable pursuant to s. 50 of the <i>Arbitration Act</i>.  By
    orders dated January 31, 2008, the applications judge awarded costs of $8,900
    to Local 183 for each of the applications (the “Costs Orders”).    </p>

      of an arbitration that the parties have an agreement to submit their dispute
      to the arbitrator.  For there to be an arbitration award, there must first
      be an arbitration agreement and that element is problematic in the case

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>the time has come to recognize formally that when
    a member joins a union, a relationship in the nature of a contract arises
    between the member and the trade union as a legal entity.  By the act of

    the union for its breach. [Emphasis omitted.]</p>

      amounted to an arbitration.  He reached this conclusion based on a consideration

      Maska </i>at pp. 589 and 602-605, which may be considered when determining

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    central issue in this appeal is whether the applications judge erred in concluding
    that the Stephens Decisions are arbitration awards capable of being enforced
    pursuant to s. 50 of the <i>Arbitration Act</i>.  Before turning to the issue,
    I will address the standard of review that applies to the decision below.    </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE STANDARD OF REVIEW</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    standard of review on questions of law is correctness whereas the palpable
    and overriding standard of review applies to pure questions of fact.  For
    questions of mixed law and fact, the standard of review lies on a spectrum
    between the two standards: see <i>Housen v. Nikolaisen</i>, [2002] 2 S.C.R.
    235, at para. 36.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    parties agree that the essence of the decision below – namely, that the Stephens
    Decisions are arbitration awards capable of enforcement in the courts pursuant
    to the <i>Arbitration</i> <i>Act</i> – is a question of mixed law and fact.  They
    disagree, however, on where on the spectrum that decision lies.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, a standard of review closer to the correctness end of the spectrum
    applies.  The decision in question is based on the interpretation of a contract
    (the Local Constitution), and the <i>Arbitration Act</i>.  Thus, it depends
    far more on the application of legal principles than on findings of fact
    based on evidence introduced by the parties.  As I explain below, the errors
    made below are errors in principle.  They include a failure to follow proper
    principles of contractual interpretation when construing the Local Constitution.  In
    cases dealing with the interpretation of contracts, the failure to follow
    proper principles of contractual interpretation is an error of law subject
    to the standard of correctness: see <i>MacDougall v. MacDougall </i>(2005),
    262 D.L.R. (4th) 120 (Ont.

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    50(1) of the <i>Arbitration Act </i>reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A person who is entitled to enforcement of an award
    made in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario or elsewhere in
    <st1:place

    may make an application to the court to that effect.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Except
    in certain situations, none of which are relevant to the present appeals,
    s. 50(3) of the <i>Arbitration Act </i>makes it mandatory that the court
    give a judgment enforcing an arbitration award. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    combined effect of ss. 50(1) and (3) is to require the court, in the circumstances
    of these cases, to give a judgment enforcing the Stephens Decisions, so long
    as those decisions are arbitration awards.  To determine whether the Stephens
    Decisions are arbitration awards, one must turn to s. 2(1) of the <i>Arbitration
    Act</i>.  Section 2(1) reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2. (1) This Act applies to an arbitration conducted
    under an arbitration agreement unless,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) the application of this Act is excluded by
    law; or …</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    a plain reading of s. 2(1), so long as the application of the <i>Arbitration
    Act </i>is not excluded by law, it applies if:  (1) there was an arbitration;
    and (2) the arbitration was conducted under an arbitration agreement.  Arbitration
    agreement is defined in s. 1 of the <i>Arbitration Act</i> as:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>an agreement by which two or more persons agree
    to submit to arbitration a dispute that has arisen or may arise between them;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the present case, there is no suggestion that the <i>Arbitration Act </i>was
    excluded by operation of law.  Thus, the applications judge was required
    to determine whether the proceedings conducted by CIHO Stephens were arbitrations
    and, if so, whether they had been conducted pursuant to an arbitration agreement,
    as that term is defined in the <i>Arbitration Act</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    stress that both elements must be considered because the applications judge
    appears to have conflated the two.  Recall that as part of the applications
    judge’s inquiry into whether the proceedings conducted by CIHO Stephens were
    arbitrations, he asked whether the parties had agreed to be bound by the
    decisions of CIHO Stephens.  However, instead of making that determination,
    he considered whether the Local Constitution included an arbitration agreement.  When
    he concluded that it did, he inferred that the appellants had agreed to be
    bound by any decision that was rendered pursuant to the process contained
    in the Local Constitution that had led to the hearings conducted by CIHO
    Stephens.  While it may be that in certain instances an agreement to abide
    by a decision can be found in the arbitration agreement, given that s. 2(1)
    of the <i>Arbitration Act</i> requires both elements in order for it to apply,
    it is preferable to consider and make a determination on each element separately.      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    any event, as I will now explain, neither element required by s. 2(1) is
    present in this case.        <span>  </span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>            <i>Were the proceedings

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The common law has in fact developed
      two concepts which it regards as characteristic of arbitration: the existence
      of a dispute and the duty or intent of the parties, as the case may be,

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Was
    there a dispute between the parties?  As I explain more fully in the following
    section, in my view, the matter that CIHO Stephens was called on to decide
    was not a dispute between the parties.  Rather, he was charged with determining
    whether allegations that members of the union had breached the Constitutions
    or CEPC had been proven and, if so, what punishment should follow such a
    determination.  In the case of Dionisio and Dias, it will be recalled, the
    allegation was that they had participated in a scheme to divide $5 million
    from Local 183.  The allegation against Ferreira was that he had misled members
    of Local 183 in respect of the role that he played within the local.  </p>

    <i>Downey</i> <i>v.</i> <i>Leitner</i>, 2004 CanLII 34927 (ON S.C.), Whitten
    J. was required to consider the disciplinary process as set out in a union
    constitution in the context of a motion to strike portions of a statement
    of defence.  The defendant argued that the union constitution was an arbitration
    agreement under the <i>Arbitration Act</i>.  In rejecting this argument,
    at para. 8 of the reasons, Whitten J. stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Participation in a discipline process by filing
    or answering a complaint is not as a function of an agreement between the
    parties; it is solely a discipline or offence finding exercise.</p>

    of the second characteristic of an arbitration?  Was it the intent or duty
    of the parties to submit the matter to arbitration?  As a purely factual
    matter, the answer to that question must be “no”.  The appellants did not
    agree that the matter should be decided by CIHO Stephens and they said so.  They
    disputed his jurisdiction, arguing that the allegations were matters for
    the Board to decide.  They also questioned CIHO Stephens’ ability to conduct
    a fair and impartial hearing and gave cogent reasons for that concern.  Finally
    and very significantly, in my view, the applications judge erred when he
    concluded that the appellants agreed to be bound by the decisions of CIHO
    Stephens by virtue of having become union members.  When the appellants became
    members of Local 183, they had no choice but to abide by the Local Constitution,
    including the internal disciplinary hearing provisions contained in article
    XII, if they wanted to be able to work as construction labourers.  As I explain
    more fully below, an agreement to abide by a disciplinary process contained
    in a union constitution does not amount to evidence of an intention to submit
    disputes to arbitration.</p>

    previously mentioned, the applications judge held that when the appellants
    became members of the union, they became bound by the Local Constitution
    and a relationship in the nature of a contract arose between the member and
    Local 183.  I agree:  see <i>Berry v. Pulley </i>at para. 48.  However, I
    do not agree that the Local Constitution contains an arbitration agreement,
    as that term is defined in the <i>Arbitration Act</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Arbitration
    agreement, it will be recalled, is defined in s. 1 as “an agreement by which
    two or more persons agree to submit to arbitration a dispute that has arisen
    or may arise between them”.  As the applications judge correctly noted, there
    is no express agreement in the Local Constitution that disputes which arise
    under its terms are to be decided by arbitration.  Accordingly, it falls
    to be determined whether such an agreement can be implied.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    turning to article XII of the Local Constitution
    – the only provision in the Local Constitution from which such an implication
    might be drawn – it is useful to make some general observations about the
    Local Constitution.  The Local Constitution is a standard form agreement
    by which each affiliated local union of LIUNA must abide.  Neither a local
    union nor a person wishing to become a member of the union has any power
    to change the terms of the Local Constitution.  The relationship between
    union and member is “in the nature of a contract”<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    for many purposes a union constitution may be treated as a contract, when
    considering its fundamental nature for the purpose of determining whether
    it is an arbitration agreement, it is important to keep in mind the caution
    expressed by the Supreme Court in saying that it is “in the nature of a contract”.  That
    caution flows, in part, from the fact that union constitutions are adhesion
    contracts.  Those who join the union have no bargaining power to affect the
    terms of membership and, in many situations, membership is a prerequisite
    to employment, leaving the individual with little choice but to accept the
    constitution and its terms.<a

    Local Constitution, it should be resolved in favour of the appellants on
    the basis of the principle of <i>contra proferentem</i>: see <i>Zurich Life
    Insurance Co. of Canada v. Davies</i>, [1981] 2 S.C.R. 670, at p. 674.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    unique character and context of the Local Constitution, as well as the nature
    of the questions in issue, will necessarily inform its construction in any
    given situation:  see <i>Berry v. Pulley </i>at para. 49.  Consequently,
    it is useful to bear in mind that the Local Constitution serves two purposes.  The
    first is to establish the relationship between the local union and its parent,
    LIUNA.  The second is to set out the rules, rights, obligations and powers
    of the local and of those who become its members.  </p>

    in mind these considerations, I turn to article XII, the provision under
    which Weiss preferred charges and LIUNA’s General President referred the
    charges to CIHO Stephens for decision and disposition.  The full text of
    article XII is contained in Schedule “A” to these reasons.  The most critical

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Is
    article XII an agreement “to submit to arbitration a dispute that has arisen
    or may arise” under the Local Constitution?  In my view, it is not.  On a
    plain reading of article XII, it establishes a process by which disciplinary
    matters and/or alleged offences are resolved.  Further, I do not accept that
    the appellants agreed “to submit to arbitration” such matters.  They agreed
    to be bound by a process should it be alleged that they had contravened the
    Constitutions or the CEPC.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Consider
    the language used in article XII.  “Charges” are to be “preferred” against
    an
    “accused” and must include the provisions alleged to have been “violated” (s.
    1).  A “hearing and trial” date is to be set (s. 2).  The burden of proof
    is on the “charging party” and the “accused” has the right to be present
    throughout the trial and, if present, “shall” present a “defense” (s. 4).  The
    process described in s. 4 is more akin to that in a criminal or quasi-criminal
    trial, than it is to the conduct of an arbitration.  (Section 7 goes on to
    provide a right of appeal to the “Appellate Officer of the International
    Union”.)    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I have said, the language used in article XII is consistent with establishing
    a process for disciplining offending members and/or offence finding.  This
    view of article XII is reinforced by reference to one of the purposes of
    the Local Constitution, which is to regulate the relationship between the
    local and its members. For a process to be characterized as an arbitration,
    a formulated or defined dispute must exist between the parties; an unresolved
    problem or matter about which they disagree will not suffice: see <i>Precision
    Drilling Corp. v. Matthews Equipment Ltd. </i>(2000), 267 A.R. 286 (Q.B.),
    at para. 22.  In my view, internal disciplinary matters are not “disputes” within
    the sense of the word as it is used in the definition of arbitration agreement
    in s. 1 of the <i>Arbitration Act</i>.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    where as in the present case, there is no Executive Board, the General President
    unilaterally chooses to whom the matter is referred and LIUNA pays that person
    to hear and dispose of the charges.  The hallmark of a judicial decision-maker
    is that he or she is independent and impartial.  That requirement is enshrined
    in s. 11(1) of the <i>Arbitration Act</i>, which provides that an arbitrator “shall
    be independent of the parties and shall act impartially”.  Arguably, CIHO
    Stephens was neither.  He was appointed and paid for by one party (LIUNA).  The
    appellants had no say in the choice of hearing officer.  And, at least in
    the eyes of Dionisio and Dias, CIHO Stephens had been involved in prior proceedings
    involving the appellants.  In that regard, Dionisio and Dias wrote in their
    letter to CIHO Stephens dated January 8, 2007, that CIHO Stephens had participated
    in the proceedings that resulted in Local 183 being placed in trusteeship.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    article XVI, s. 3 of the International Union Constitution<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[4]</span></span></span></a> expressly limits the ability of members, Local
    Unions, District Councils and other subordinate bodies from bringing any
    action in the courts.  This reinforces the notion that the disciplinary provisions
    in the Local Constitution were intended to be internal in nature.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the final analysis, based on the language used, the process contemplated
    in the Local Constitution, and the nature of the relationship between the
    parties, although the appellants agreed to be bound by the process contained
    in article XII, they did not agree to submit disputes to arbitration.  Article
    XII is nothing more or less than what it appears – an internal mechanism
    by which disciplinary matters that arise under the terms of the Local Constitution
    may be resolved without recourse to outside bodies.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ADDITIONAL ISSUES </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants raised five additional issues which, in light of the foregoing
    analysis, can be dealt with summarily.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the appellants say that by virtue of the Board decision in June 2006, the
    Board took jurisdiction over all disciplinary matters involving staff and
    officers of Local 183 while it was in trusteeship.  They submit that as the
    Board had exclusive jurisdiction over the subject matter of the applications,
    it was not open to the court to decide them.  In light of my conclusion in
    respect of the Stephens Decisions, it is unnecessary to decide this issue
    and I decline to do so.  It is an important issue that is better left to
    be decided in a case in which it has been fully argued and for which there
    is an appropriate evidentiary record.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the same reasons, I would decline to decide the second and third of the additional
    issues raised by the appellants.  Both of these issues are very significant
    and warrant a full and proper exploration.  The second such issue is whether
    CIHO Stephens had the authority to levy a fine or otherwise make the monetary
    orders that he did.  The third is whether Local 183 had standing under s.
    50(1) of the <i>Arbitration Act </i>to bring the applications.  It will be
    recalled that s. 50(1) reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>50. (1) A person who is entitled to enforcement
    of an award made in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario or elsewhere in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    may make an application to the court to that effect.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants argue that Local 183 was not a party to the hearing before CIHO
    Stephens and, therefore, was not a party to his decision.  Thus, they contend,
    Local 183 was not a “person entitled to enforcement of an award made in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario” and lacked standing to bring the applications.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  Fourth,
    the appellants say that their expulsion from membership in LIUNA and Local
    183 rendered moot the Stephens Decisions and, consequently, the court ought
    to have declined to decide the applications.  The general principle that
    a court should decline to decide a case that raises merely a hypothetical
    or abstract question applies when the decision of the court would not have
    the effect of resolving some controversy which affects, or might affect,
    the rights of the parties: see <i>Borowski v. Canada (Attorney General)</i>,
    [1989] 1 S.C.R. 342, at p. 353.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the applications judge that a live dispute remained between the
    parties, namely, whether the Stephens Decisions were arbitration awards capable
    of being enforced by the courts.  The fact that the appellants are no longer
    members of Local 183 or LIUNA does not render that dispute academic.  There
    is no question that the court’s decision has a practical effect on the rights
    of the parties because that decision dictates whether the Stephens Decisions
    can be enforced as judgments of the court.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    fifth issue raised by the appellants is whether the applications judge erred
    by failing to consider that there is no contractual relationship between
    members of a union that arises out of a union’s constitution.  With respect,
    I do not see how this issue is relevant to the matters in issue on these
    appeals.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would raise two final considerations.  First, the Stephens Decisions suspend
    the appellants from membership<a href="#_ftn5"
name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[5]</span></span></span></a> as well as require them to pay monies.  While
    the requirement to pay money is a remedy that the court has the jurisdiction
    to grant,<a href="#_ftn6"
name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[6]</span></span></span></a> it is not clear to me that it has the jurisdiction
    to suspend them from membership.  It may be that s. 50(7) of the <i>Arbitration
    Act </i>could be utilised to deal with this matter,<a href="#_ftn7"
name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[7]</span></span></span></a>  however, as the parties have not raised this
    as an issue and it is unnecessary to decide the matter on these appeals,
    nothing more need be said on the matter.  Second, following the hearing of
    this appeal, the respondent brought to our attention this court’s recent
    decision in <i>Birch
    v. Union of Taxation Employees, Local 70030</i>, 2008 ONCA 809, in which
    a union sought to enforce, through the courts, fines it had imposed against
    its members for crossing a picket line.  In my view, this appeal differs
    from <i>Birch</i> in a material respect.  The union here is not seeking to
    enforce a fine but to recognize the Stephens Decisions as arbitration awards.  This
    distinction is relevant for two reasons.  First, pursuant to s. 50(3) of
    the <i>Arbitration Act</i>, so long as none of the exceptions in s. 50(3)
    apply, once a decision is recognized as an arbitration award, the court has
    no discretion.  It must give a judgment enforcing the award.  Second, as
    I have said, the Stephens Decisions were not limited to imposing “fines” on
    the appellants.  CIHO Stephens also suspended the appellants from membership.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>DISPOSITION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I would allow the appeals, set aside the Judgments and Costs Orders, and
    dismiss the applications.  I would award costs of the appeals to the appellants,
    fixed at $15,000, inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    light of my conclusion on the appeals, it is unnecessary to consider the
    request to grant leave to appeal the Costs Orders.  The appellants are entitled
    to their costs of the applications.  As the appellants Dionisio and Dias
    were separately represented from Ferreira on the applications, I would award
    Dionisio and Dias together, costs of the application fixed at $8,900, inclusive
    of disbursements and GST.  Similarly, I would award Ferreira costs of the
    application of $8,900, all inclusive.      </p>

    any court, whether in law or equity, any action against a Local Union, District
    Council or the International Union or their officers, representatives or

    as a matter of contract.  The sole and exclusive remedy for the enforcement
    of rights found in this Constitution shall be through procedures contained
    herein, including provisions relating to charges, trials and appeals.  Decisions
    of the General President or the General Executive Board regarding such constitutional
    rights or, upon any appeal of the International Union Convention, deciding
    any such rights are final and binding and not subject to further judicial
    review.</p>
