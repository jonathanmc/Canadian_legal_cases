style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant was convicted of numerous prostitution-related offences.  The convictions
    included one for the offence created by s. 212(1)(2.1) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>.  That offence is directed at persons who live off the avails of
    prostitutes under eighteen years of age and who use violence or threats of
    violence in relation to those prostitutes.  Counsel for the appellant aptly
    describes the offence as “aggravated living off the avails of a person under
    eighteen”.  Section 212(1)(2.1) provides for a mandatory minimum sentence
    of five years in the penitentiary.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge determined that the appropriate total sentence was five years.  She
    gave the appellant eighteen months’ credit for his pre-trial incarceration
    resulting in a sentence of three and a half years.  In her reasons, the trial
    judge indicated that but for the mandatory minimum sentence of five years,
    she would have imposed a shorter sentence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    part of the appellant’s sentence appeal, he challenges the constitutionality
    of the five-year mandatory minimum penalty imposed by s. 212(1)(2.1).  The
    appellant submits that the mandatory minimum sentence constitutes cruel and  unusual
    punishment, violates s. 12 of the <i>Charter</i> and is rendered inoperative
    by s. 52 of the <i>Constitution Act, 1982</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    constitutionality of s. 212(1)(2.1) was not challenged at trial.  Counsel
    at trial attempted to avoid the mandatory minimum by arguing that the <i>Kienapple</i> principle
    should be applied to stay the conviction entered against the appellant on
    the s. 212(1)(2.1) charge.  The trial judge rejected this argument and it
    is not renewed on appeal.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    counsel for the appellant had filed her factum in which she raises the constitutional
    question, Crown counsel requested a case management meeting.  She submitted
    that the appellant should not be allowed to raise the constitutionality of
    s. 212(1)(2.1) for the first time on appeal.  Counsel agreed that the panel
    scheduled to hear the appeal in May 2009 should decide this preliminary issue
    based on written submissions.  We have received and considered those submissions.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Generally
    speaking, appeal courts will not entertain arguments not made at trial:  <i>Kaiman
    v. Graham</i>, [2009] O.J. No. 324 at paras. 18-19 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  That general rule applies to constitutional arguments raised for the
    first time on appeal regardless of whether the arguments invoke the remedial
    powers of s. 24 of the <i>Charter</i> or the nullifying power in s. 52(1)
    of the <i>Constitution Act, 1982</i>: e.g. see <i>R. v. L.G.</i> (2007),
    228 C.C.C. (3d) 194 at para. 43 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    );  <i>R. v. Seo</i> (1986), 25 C.C.C. (3d) 385 at 394 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>An
    appellate court does, however, have the discretion to permit new arguments,
    including <i>Charter</i> arguments.  In exercising that discretion, the appellate
    court must be satisfied that the new issue raised on appeal can be fully,
    effectively and fairly addressed on appeal even though it was not raised
    at trial.  An appellate court will be most inclined to exercise its discretion
    in favour of hearing a new argument where that new argument can be fully
    addressed and determined based on the trial record:  e.g. see <i>R. v. Sweeney</i> (2000),
    148 C.C.C. (3d) 247 at paras. 34-40 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  More rarely, an appellate court will hear a new argument based on an
    evidentiary record laid out for the first time in the court of appeal:  e.g. <i>R.
    v. Seo</i>, <i>supra</i>.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, the more numerous and contentious the evidentiary disputes generated
    by the material filed on appeal in respect of the issue raised for the first
    time on appeal, the less likely it is that the appellate court will exercise
    its discretion in favour of considering the merits of the new argument.  While
    appeal courts do resolve evidentiary disputes from time to time in the course
    of deciding appeals, appellate procedures are not designed for that purpose.  The
    appellate forum and its procedures are not adapted to the weighing of evidence
    and the finding of facts.  Appeal courts review decisions made at trial.  The
    appeal process is premised on the issues under appeal having been vetted
    in the trial court and subjected to the reasoned analysis of the trial court.  If
    a new argument put forward on appeal can only be effectively and fairly resolved
    by conducting what amounts to the trial of an issue or several issues in
    the appellate court, the appellate court should, absent exceptional circumstances
    where the interests of justice require otherwise, decline to resolve the
    new issue raised on appeal.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    nature and number of issues that this court would have to address if it considered
    the merits of the constitutional argument raised by the appellant become
    apparent upon a review of the Supreme Court of Canada’s s. 12 jurisprudence.  That
    jurisprudence reveals a somewhat complex two-layered analysis:  see <i>R.
    v. Wiles</i>, [2005] 3 S.C.R. 895;  <i>R. v. Ferguson</i> (2008), 228 C.C.C.
    (3d) 385 (S.C.C.).  The cases and the Crown’s written submissions indicate
    that the issues that will have to be addressed in the constitutional argument
    include:</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    harm caused by the offence created by s. 212(1)(2.1);</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    effect of the criminalized conduct on the individual victims and the broader
    community;</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    extent to which the harm done by the prohibited conduct impacts disproportionately
    on discrete and particularly vulnerable categories of victims;</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    problems associated with the effective prevention and detection of the criminal
    activity involved in offences under s. 212(1)(2.1);</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    value as a deterrent of mandatory minimum sentences; and</p>
  <p><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    legislative intent and purpose of the provision.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Some
    of the material that the Crown indicates it will file will come from unimpeachable
    sources and will refer to legislative facts that can be effectively assessed
    within the context of an appeal.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  It is, however, inevitable that some of the material
    filed by the Crown will contain opinions and factual analysis that will be
    contentious.  It is highly likely that the appellant will have to cross-examine
    on some of the material put forward by the Crown.  It is equally likely that
    the appellant will want to prepare responding material.  Having regard to
    what the Crown anticipates will be its defence of the constitutionality of
    the provision, I anticipate a full blown evidentiary battle in respect of
    at least some of the issues that are central to the appellant’s constitutional
    challenge.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    court is not the appropriate forum in which to join that battle.  I say that
    for two reasons.  First, as indicated above, within the criminal justice
    system, the trial court is the acknowledged forum in which to test and assess
    competing evidentiary claims.  Addressing those issues in the appellate court
    without the benefit of the trial court’s assessment is not the ideal recipe
    for sound decision-making.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    second reason I would decline to hear the constitutional argument is a more
    practical one grounded in the probable chronology of this appeal.  The appellant
    received a three and a half year sentence in April 2007.  His mandatory release
    date occurs when he has served two-thirds of his sentence.  The appellant
    will have served two-thirds of his sentence (twenty-eight months) in August
    of this year.  Were the court to allow the appellant to raise this constitutional
    issue, the preparation of the Crown’s responding material, the probable reply
    material from the appellant, and probable cross-examination by both parties
    would take the preparation of this appeal well beyond August of this year.  My
    experience suggests that this appeal would not be ready for oral argument
    until well into the fall of 2009.  If the appeal were to follow what I think
    is its probable course if the court allowed the constitutional issue to proceed,
    the appellant will be released well before the appeal is heard.  By then,
    the constitutional question will be of only intellectual interest to him.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    constitutional issue raised by the appellant is an important one.  It is,
    however, an issue that will arise in the normal course.  Anyone convicted
    under the provision can raise the constitutional argument at trial and, if
    unsuccessful, carry the issue to the court of appeal where the merits can
    be decided on a full trial record.  There is no reason to think that this
    issue will allude appellate scrutiny if it is not considered in this case.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    would direct that the appellant cannot raise the constitutionality of the
    mandatory minimum punishment in s. 212(1)(2.1) on his sentence appeal.  His
    conviction appeal and the remainder of his sentence appeal should proceed
    as scheduled on May 4th.  </p>
