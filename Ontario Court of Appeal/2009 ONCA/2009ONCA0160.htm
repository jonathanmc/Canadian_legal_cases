  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    issue in this appeal is whether the motion judge, Wood J., erred in setting
    aside a final order based on Minutes of Settlement.  The appellant submits
    that the motion judge made palpable and overriding errors in his assessment
    of the facts and failed to apply the proper test as to whether the parties
    had reached a settlement.  For the following reasons, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    appellant and the respondent lived in a common-law relationship for four
    and one-half years between 1999 and 2004 and separated in July 2004 after
    an allegation by the respondent that the appellant had assaulted her.  The
    respondent has three children from a previous relationship.  In August 2004,
    the respondent commenced proceedings seeking spousal and child support and
    claiming certain property by way of a constructive trust.  Although the parties
    were represented by counsel, it is apparent that they continued to negotiate
    between themselves without lawyers in an attempt to resolve these issues.  In
    view of the submissions by the appellant, a somewhat detailed chronology
    is required.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>October 26, 2004</b>    DiTomaso J. grants order
    that appellant provide interim spousal support in the amount of $1,400 commencing
    November 1, 2004</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>February 16, 2005</b>  At request of respondent,
    criminal assault charges against appellant are withdrawn and appellant enters
    into peace bond with condition not to communicate directly or indirectly
    with respondent except with her written consent</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>February 25, 2005</b>  Appellant’s solicitor
    writes to respondent’s solicitor advising that she understood the parties
    had reached a final settlement; she enclosed proposed terms of the final
    settlement and asked respondent’s solicitor to review the terms with the
    respondent and respond as soon as possible.  In summary, the proposed terms
    were:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-subquote>1.         An
    “equalization payment” of $37,440 to be made by way of spousal support payments
    of $700.00 per month commencing March 1, 2005 and terminating February 1,
    2009.  Payments are tax deductible to appellant and taxable in hands of respondent.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-subquote>2.         No child support.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-subquote>3.         Respondent to retain RRSP registered
    in her name and a vehicle; appellant has transferred motor vehicle to respondent.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-subquote>4.         Respondent is to vacate
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    31 Forest Wood Drive by February 28, 2005.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-subquote>5.         Respondent to release claims against
    31 Forest Wood and any claim to any other property.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-subquote>7. [sic]            Parties agree to withdraw
    from Family Responsibility Office.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-subquote>8.         Parties agree separation date is
    July 24, 2004.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-subquote>9.         No costs payable for the action.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>April 1, 2005            </b>            Respondent’s
    solicitor writes in response to the February 25 letter saying she has met
    with the respondent and indicates that the terms reflect the discussions
    between the parties except that there should be a reference to the $1400
    per month from November 1, 2004 until the day the respondent moved.  She
    says she will meet with the respondent after the appellant’s solicitor has
    prepared the Minutes of Settlement to finalize the matter.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>April 28, 2005          </b>Respondent’s solicitor
    asks for the Minutes of Settlement “to reflect the agreement between Mr.
    Andrews and Ms. Lundrigan”.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>May 16, 2005            </b>Appellant’s solicitor
    sends to respondent’s solicitor the Minutes of Settlement.  She asks that
    the respondent execute them and return them for the appellant to execute.  She
    will then file them with the court.  The terms are essentially the same as
    in the February 25 letter except the equalization payment is now referred
    to as compensatory spousal support, and payments made under the order of
    DiTomaso J. are reflected.  There is also reference to the respondent having
    vacated
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    31 Forest Wood Drive on March 1, 2005.  Finally, a term is included stating
    that no child support is payable by the appellant “now or in the future”</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>June 22, 2005           </b>Letter from respondent’s
    solicitor to appellant’s solicitor enclosing signed copies of Minutes of
    Settlement, but these minutes have several changes from the May 16 version.  One
    change is to the amount of the support payment to reflect the amount already
    paid by the appellant to the respondent in accordance with the order of DeTomaso
    J.  It also clarifies that the respondent has indeed vacated 31
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Forest Wood.  In addition, the Minutes now include a new para. 4:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-subquote>Any Order of the Court for custody, access or
    support is not necessarily final and may be varied by the Court if a change
    in circumstances occurs, in accordance with the Act under which the Order
    is made and the Rules of the Court</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>July 5, 2005  </b>Letter from appellant’s solicitor
    indicating that “we are in agreement with the Minutes of Settlement save
    and except for paragraph 4, which we request be deleted”.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>July to September   </b>Respondent’s solicitor
    met with respondent and the respondent signed three different versions of
    the Minutes of Settlement; the first and third delete paragraph 4 and the
    second does not.  They are dated August 18; none were ever sent to the appellant.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>September 6, 2005  </b>Letter from respondent’s
    solicitor to appellant’s solicitor [letter is not included in materials and
    its contents are unknown]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>September 8, 2005  </b>Letter from appellant’s
    solicitor in response to the September 6 letter stating:</p>

    of Settlement by September 16, 2005</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>October 5, 2005</b>       Letter from respondent’s

    and entered.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    respondent states that when she entered the residential treatment programme
    she was not aware that the appellant had signed the Minutes of Settlement,
    that she did not intend that those Minutes still be open for completion,
    and that she had instructed her solicitor that she would not agree to them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      It
    appears that before the motion judge, counsel for the appellant argued that
    the Minutes of Settlement of June 22, 2005 were never withdrawn and were
    always open for acceptance, as they were when the appellant signed them on
    October 11, 2005. The motion judge held that when the appellant signed the
    Minutes of Settlement in October&nbsp;11, 2005, they were no longer open
    for acceptance.  Rather, it was apparent from the September and October correspondence
    that the parties were contemplating that new Minutes of Settlement be prepared.  In
    the result, he was not satisfied “that the parties were <i>ad idem</i> at
    any point throughout the long negotiations”.  It followed that the appellant
    was not entitled to simply sign the June Minutes of Settlement.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      Before
    this court, counsel for the appellant, who was not counsel before the motion
    judge, made a different argument. She submits that by May 16, 2005, the parties
    had reached a settlement because they had agreed on all of the essential
    terms.  Counsel relies upon the decision of this court in <i>Bogue v. Bogue</i> (1999),
    46 O.R. (3d) 1, which in turn relied upon this court’s decision in <i>Bawitko
    Investments Ltd. v. Kernels Popcorn Ltd.</i> (1991), 79 D.L.R. (4th) 97.  The
    critical passage from <i>Bawitko</i> is found at pp. 103-104:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>As a matter of normal business practice, parties
    planning to make a formal written document the expression of their agreement,
    necessarily discuss and negotiate the proposed terms of the agreement before
    they enter into it. They frequently agree upon all of the terms to be incorporated
    into the intended written document before it is prepared. Their agreement
    may be expressed orally or by way of memorandum, by exchange of correspondence,
    or other informal writings. The parties may &quot;contract to make a contract&quot;,
    that is to say, they may bind themselves to execute at a future date a formal
    written agreement containing specific terms and conditions. When they agree
    on all of the essential provisions to be incorporated in a formal document
    with the intention that their agreement shall thereupon become binding, they
    will have fulfilled all the requisites for the formation of a contract. The
    fact that a formal written document to the same effect is to be thereafter
    prepared and signed does not alter the binding validity of the original contract.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>However, when the original contract is incomplete
    because essential provisions intended to govern the contractual relationship
    have not been settled or agreed upon; or the contract is too general or uncertain
    to be valid in itself and is dependent on the making of a formal contract;
    or the understanding or intention of the parties, <i>even if there is no
    uncertainty as to the terms of their agreement, is that their legal obligations
    are to be deferred until a formal contract has been approved and executed,
    the original or preliminary agreement cannot constitute an enforceable contract</i>.
    In other words, in such circumstances the &quot;contract to make a contract&quot; is
    not a contract at all. The execution of the contemplated formal document
    is not intended only as a solemn record or memorial of an already complete
    and binding contract but is essential to the formation of the contract itself. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    appellant says that from May 16 the parties had agreed on all of the essential
    terms of the settlement, and the fact that there was some uncertainty about
    whether the written memorandum of those terms was open for signature is beside
    the point; the parties had made a contract.  As in <i>Bawitko</i>, the fact
    that the parties contemplated that there was to be a formal written document
    to the same effect as the terms upon which the parties had agreed does not
    alter the binding validity of the original agreement or settlement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      In
    our view, the motion judge did not err in finding that the June 22 Minutes
    were no longer open for acceptance. We would also not give effect to the
    slightly different argument made before us. We address that latter argument
    first.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      As
    the passage quoted above from <i>Bawitko</i> indicates, the intention of
    the parties is important in determining whether or not there was a final
    settlement that was merely to be recorded in a formal document.  The term “intention” is
    not used in a subjective sense but rather to refer to whether “in the eyes
    of a hypothetical onlooker [the parties] appeared to have reached an agreement”:  G.H.L.
    Fridman, <i>The Law of Contract in Canada</i>, 5th ed. (
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto: Thomson Carswell, 2006), at p. 6.  In making this determination,
    the court will look at the conduct of the parties at the time.  As was said
    in <i>Bawitko</i> at p. 104, if in examining what transpired it is apparent
    that “execution of the contemplated formal document is not intended only
    as a solemn record or memorial of an already complete and binding contract
    but is essential to the formation of the contract itself”, there is no contract,
    or in this case, no settlement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    course of conduct by both parties indicates that they viewed a formal document
    as essential and moreover, as held by the motion judge, that they had not
    agreed on the terms of that document.  The appellant made this explicit in
    his solicitor’s letter of July 5, 2005 refusing to accept the Minutes of
    Settlement as drafted because of the inclusion of a term that had not been
    agreed upon, namely paragraph 4, concerning variation of custody, access
    and support.  It may be said that paragraph 4 was extraneous and unnecessary
    because courts always retain the right to vary terms where there has been
    a change of circumstances in accordance with the governing legislation.  However,
    the inclusion of the term was apparently important to the respondent and
    its exclusion was important to the appellant, who for many months was not
    prepared to finalize the settlement while that term remained part of the
    formal document.  A reasonable observer could conclude that preparation of
    a mutually acceptable formal document was essential to the settlement.  The
    course of conduct by the parties, especially the appellant in refusing to
    sign the June Terms of Settlement for over three months, simply reinforces
    this conclusion.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the motion judge found that there was no agreement
    and that the parties were not <i>ad idem</i> because he misapprehended the
    evidence.  The appellant particularly relies upon para. 25 of the reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>On September 8, 2005 [the appellant’s solicitor]
    on behalf of the [appellant], demanded that new minutes be executed failing
    which court action would be taken.  [The respondent’s solicitor’s] reply
    on October 5, 2005 also contemplates new minutes as she advises that her
    client is in no condition to sign minutes.  This assertion is backed up by
    the [respondent’s] admission to Georgianwood soon after.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the motion judge misapprehended the meaning of the
    September 8 letter. He argues that the appellant’s solicitor was not asking
    for new Minutes of Settlement and denies that this letter was an indication
    that the parties had not agreed on the terms of the settlement.  In our view,
    the motion judge did not misapprehend the evidence and in particular did
    not misapprehend the meaning of the September 8, 2005 letter.  That letter
    demonstrates that the appellant was aware that the June Terms of Settlement
    were not intended as a final settlement of the dispute.  There is no other
    way to interpret the request for completed Minutes of Settlement.  If the
    June terms, which had been signed by the respondent, reflected the agreement
    reached by the parties, there would be no reason for the appellant to request
    a new document; all the appellant had to do at that point was sign the copy
    already signed by the respondent and return it to the respondent’s solicitor.
    We would therefore not give effect to the appellant’s principal submission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    are also satisfied that the motion judge was correct in finding that the
    June Minutes of Settlement were not open for acceptance in October. That
    the June terms were no longer open for acceptance as the formal record of
    the agreement is put beyond dispute by the letter from the respondent’s solicitor
    advising that her client was under the care of a physician and “unable to
    sign Minutes of Settlement”.  It is apparent that both parties were no longer
    operating on the basis of the June Minutes of Settlement and that they did
    not intend for that document to be the formal record of their purported agreement.  At
    all relevant times the parties considered that the terms of the intended
    formal agreement were not yet settled.  See <i>Bawitko</i> at p. 104.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    have not been persuaded that the motion judge erred in his findings of fact
