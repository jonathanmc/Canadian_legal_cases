    and Luciano Marcoccia are in the midst of litigation following the breakdown
    of their marriage.  This litigation has been on-going since 2006 and has
    been marked by allegations of non-disclosure of financial records. On August
    23, 2006, Perkins J. made an order restraining Mr. Marcoccia from depleting
    his assets.   During the marriage, Mr.&nbsp;Marcoccia and Mr. Mariani were
    each 50 percent owners of YCL.  Most, if not all, of Mr. Marcoccia’s income
    was derived from YCL.  At some point, Mr. Marcoccia set up a management company
    York Contracting Services (YCS), which was wholly owned by him and to which
    management fees were paid by YCL. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    and Mrs. Marcoccia have each retained experts to attempt to determine the
    value of Mr. Marcoccia’s interest in YCL and YCS, and his income for purposes
    of calculating child and spousal support.  Mrs. Marcoccia’s expert, Jonathan
    Hames, has identified a number of problems with Mr. Marcoccia’s expert’s
    report.  Mr. Hames seeks access to a large number of documents of both YCL
    and YCS to determine the true financial picture.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    December 19, 2007, McKinnon J. ordered Mr. Marcoccia to provide the disclosure
    listed in the Hames report.  While Mr. Marcoccia made some disclosure, some
    of the records have still not been disclosed.  On February 15, 2008, Mr.
    Marcoccia sold his 50 percent interest in YCL to Mr. Mariani.  Mrs. Marcoccia
    alleges that this sale was in violation of the non-depletion order made by
    Perkins J.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    March 5, 2008, Mrs. Marcoccia brought a motion before Boswell J. seeking
    disclosure of the outstanding records and preservation of the funds received
    by Mr.&nbsp;Marcoccia from the sale.  Boswell J. ordered that Mr. Marcoccia
    make the disclosure as was ordered by McKinnon J.  Mr. Marcoccia asserts
    that he cannot comply with the order because he no longer has a right of
    access to YCL documents and Mr. Mariani has refused to provide access.  In
    the result, Mrs. Marcoccia brought a motion under Rule 19 requiring that
    Mr. Mariani and YCL produce the records.  Mr. Marcoccia supported the making
    of the order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants resisted the making of the order.  They retained their own expert,
    Mr. Larry Joslin, who agrees that in light of the concerns raised by Mr.
    Hames, some of the requested records are relevant.  The appellants have produced
    those records.  However, Mr. Joslin opines that it is not apparent why the
    balance of the records are required.  He favours an approach of incremental
    disclosure where third parties are involved.  He has analyzed the Hames report
    and the earlier report from Mr. Marcoccia’s expert and is of the view that
    no case has been made out for the additional disclosure at this point.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his affidavit, Mr. Mariani claimed that the documents contained proprietary
    information about the business and are privileged. That issue was not pressed
    before the motion judge or in this court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rule
    19(11) of the <i>Family Law Rules</i> provides for the making of an order
    requiring a non-party to let the party seeking the records examine the documents
    and to supply the party with a copy at the legal aid rate.  The judge may
    make the order where the document is not protected by a legal privilege and “it
    would be unfair to a party to go on with the case without the document”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree with the appellants that the trial judge did not apply the proper test.  It
    is apparent from his reasons that he felt bound to order disclosure because
    McKinnon J. and Boswell J. had been satisfied that the documents were relevant
    and should be disclosed.  In our view, rule 19(11) contemplates that the
    motion judge must come to an independent determination.  The judge must be
    satisfied by the party seeking access to the documents that it would be unfair
    to the party to go on with the case without the document.  That judges have
    previously found the documents to be relevant does not necessarily determine
    that issue, especially where, as here, the non-party was not a party to the
    proceedings that led to the making of an earlier disclosure order against
    a party.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    said, we are satisfied that the order was properly made in this case.  The
    material available to the motion judge demonstrates that it would be unfair
    to Mrs.&nbsp;Marcoccia to require her to proceed with the case without access
    to the documents.  While the order that was made is broad, Mrs. Marcoccia
    has raised serious issues as to whether her husband has hidden assets and
    whether he has fully and accurately reported his income in the relevant years.  We
    do not accept the premise underlying the Joslin report that a party in the
    position of Mrs. Marcoccia is always required to proceed incrementally.  Particularly
    in this case, proceeding incrementally would only serve to delay this already
    prolonged litigation.  The documents sought should resolve the issues raised
    by Mrs. Marcoccia.  The fact that Mr. Marcoccia agrees that the order was
    properly made provides additional support for the making of the order.  He
    too is obviously convinced of the importance of the disclosure to resolve
    the serious outstanding issues.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    in the unusual circumstances of this case, it is our view that appellants
    are entitled to be reimbursed for their reasonable expenses in complying
    with the order.  The appellants have filed a report from their accountant
    setting out an estimate of the cost of compiling the records.  In our view,
    Mr. Marcoccia should pay those expenses.  He was required by the order of
    McKinnon J. to make the disclosure and should have done so before the sale
    of his interest in YCL.  Further, the order of this court allowing an appeal
    from the striking of his Answer to his wife’s claims for support and an equalization
    payment, orders that he pursue the disclosure required by the order of McKinnon
    J. and includes a term that he indemnify his wife for any cost orders made
    against her in this litigation: see <i>Marcoccia v. Marcoccia</i>,<i> </i>2008
    ONCA 866, at para. 18.</p>
