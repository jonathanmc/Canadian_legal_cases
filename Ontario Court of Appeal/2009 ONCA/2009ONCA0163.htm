    appellants were convicted of four offences under the <i>Building Code Act</i>, <i>1992</i> S.O.
    1992, c. 23, as amended (the <i>BCA</i>):</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:

    made under the <i>BCA</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    leave, they appeal their convictions. For the following reasons, I would
    dismiss the appeals.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    April 12, 2005 the appellants applied to the respondent for a building permit
    for a residential property. On April 13, 2005 the building permit was prepared
    and signed by the responsible municipal official, and was assigned a permit
    number. The appellants were telephoned by a municipal clerk and told that
    the permit was ready. In May, a copy of the permit was sent to several government
    agencies to be acted on, and the municipal council was told that the permit
    had been issued.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    a dispute developed between the appellants and the respondent about the amount
    to be paid for the permit. The appellants never picked up the permit from
    the respondent nor did they ever pay for it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    February 27, 2006 the respondent wrote to the appellants returning the plans
    and the application form, and stating that, since payment was never received,
    the application “has become void” but that the appellants could reapply for
    a building permit if they wished.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants took the position that a building permit had been issued to them
    and had never been revoked. They therefore continued to construct the building
    on the property. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the other hand, the respondent took the position that a permit had never
    been issued. On April 28, 2006 it issued an order for the appellants to comply
    with the <i>BCA</i> by obtaining a building permit and on May 5, 2006 it
    issued a stop work order for the property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this court, the appellants’ primary position was that a building permit was
    issued by the respondent and was never revoked. The appellants acknowledge
    that to succeed, they must be successful on both points, at least on the
    first three convictions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not think it is necessary to decide whether the permit was issued for
    the purposes of the <i>BCA</i>. That is a question which will depend on,
    among other things, the practices of the municipality, the understandings
    of the construction industry, and the circumstances of the particular case.
    Suffice it to say that it is in everyone’s interest that a municipality have
    a transparent policy and practice to make clear to all when a building permit
    is issued.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    this case, I am content to proceed by assuming, without deciding, that the
    respondent issued a building permit to the appellants in April 2005.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Assuming
    this to be so, there can be no doubt that as of the February 27, 2006 letter
    they received, the appellants were told by the respondent that they did not
    have the right to act as if they had a permit. Assuming a building permit
    had been issued to them, as of that date it was clearly revoked by the respondent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    8(10) of the<b><i><span style='text-transform:uppercase'> </span></i></b><i>BCA</i> empowers
    a municipality to revoke a permit if it was issued on mistaken information
    or issued in error. In this case, the respondent was mistaken and in error
    in assuming that the permit would be paid for. The power to revoke was therefore
    properly engaged. Section 8(10) does not require the explicit use of the
    word
    “revoke” when exercising that power. The substance of the statutory provision
    is satisfied here where the respondent clearly communicated to the appellants
    on February 27, 2006 that they could not act on the basis that they had a
    valid building permit. Since that communication occurred, there exists no
    basis upon which to challenge the orders of April 28 and May 5, 2006. That
    is enough to dispose of the appellants’ challenge to the first three convictions
    and their primary argument on the fourth conviction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the appellants argue in the alternative that the fourth conviction was based
    on the same facts as at least some of the earlier convictions and should
    be set aside because of the rule against multiple convictions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, this argument must also fail. While the information wants for precision,
    no particulars were sought at trial. In convicting the appellants, the trial
    judge stated his understanding that this charge was based on the fact that
    they continued to construct the building without a permit <u>after</u> the
    date on which the first information is based. Counsel for the appellants
    raised no objection to this understanding. Understood this way, as I think
    it was, the fourth charge is clearly distinguishable from the second and
    third charges which are based on defying orders made by the respondent. It
    is also distinguishable from the first charge which is based on commencing
    to build without a permit, on a specified date. The appellants agree that
    they continued to construct the building after that date. As I have concluded
    that the fourth charge was based on this continued construction and that
    the appellants understood this, it does not violate the rule against multiple
    convictions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    summary I would dismiss the appeals of all four convictions. The parties
    agree that costs ought not to be awarded in this matter and none are ordered.</p>
