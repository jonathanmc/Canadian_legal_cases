style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant appeals from the order of Rogin J. of the Superior Court of Justice
    dated August 7, 2008 dismissing her action against three sets of engineers
    and engineering firms, namely, Hanna, Ghobrial
    &amp; Spencer Ltd. and Medhat Ghobrial (the “HGS respondents”), Cochrane
    Engineering Ltd. and Peter P. Leong (the “Cochrane respondents”), and Halsall
    Associates Ltd. and Jay R. Leedale (the “Halsall respon-dents”), (collectively,
    the “Subject Engineers”).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    dispute arose from difficulties experienced by the appellant with her condominium
    townhouse in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Windsor following its acquisition in August 2002.  After the appellant took
    possession of her new residence, serious leaks developed in the basement
    and elsewhere, mold set in and the appellant and members of her family began
    to experience health problems.  When the appellant’s complaints regarding
    these problems were not resolved to her satisfaction, she commenced proceedings
    against the developer of the condominium project, the developer’s engineers,
    the condominium corporation, the involved municipality, and the Subject Engineers,
    among others.  In her action, the appellant sought damages for negligence
    and breach of contract, among other relief.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    motions for summary judgment, the motion judge dismissed the appellant’s
    action against the Subject Engineers on the basis that the appellant had
    failed to establish that they owed a duty of care to her in the circumstances,
    under the two-pronged test set out in <i>Anns v. Merton London Borough Council</i>,
    [1978] A.C. 728; and <i>Cooper v. Hobart</i>, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 537.  In particular,
    the motion judge held that the requisite degree of proximity between the
    appellant and the Subject Engineers had not been demonstrated.  Further,
    in the circumstances of this case, there were sound policy reasons for not
    imposing a duty of care on the Subject Engineers in respect of the appellant.  The
    motion judge also concluded that the <i>Professional Engineers Act</i>, R.S.O.
    1990, c. P-28 does not give rise to a private law duty of care owed by the
    Subject Engineers to the appellant.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    found it necessary to hear only from the HGS respondents, who were hired
    by the developer as design engineers for the structural and storm water management
    features of the condominium project.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant argues that her condominium townhouse as built by the developer
    did not conform with the design prepared by the HGS respondents.  She has
    pleaded that the HGS respondents owed a duty of care to her to exercise reasonable
    care, skill, diligence and competence as structural engineers in designing
    and supervising the structural components of the development to ensure that
    the premises were safe and habitable.  She maintains that the HGS respondents’ design
    of the premises was negligent and that their periodic site inspections were
    negligently performed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    four reasons, we are satisfied that the motion judge did not err in dismissing
    the appellant’s action against the HGS respondents.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    the record before the motion judge established that the HGS respondents had
    no contractual relationship with the appellant; no role in the construction
    of the condominium project or in the renovations completed at the premises;
    and no on-site responsibilities, except for the conduct of periodic inspections
    to ascertain the general conformity of the development with the design drawings
    prepared by the HGS respondents.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    neither the appellant’s pleading nor the reports of her own engineering experts
    support her contention of negligent or deficient design by the HGS respondents.  The
    primary focus of the appellant’s experts’ reports is the alleged negligence
    of the developer and its subcontractors – including, presumably, the developer’s
    engineers – in the construction of the condominium project and the claim
    that the premises, as constructed, materially deviated in numerous respects
    from the design drawings prepared by the HGS respondents.  These deviations
    from the original design in the “as-constructed works” were admitted by the
    appellant in her statement of claim.  Paragraph 45 of her pleading contains
    an acknowledgement that the problems with the premises “constitute significant
    deviations or departures” from the construction drawings.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third,
    the complaints of the appellant’s engineering experts regarding the on-site
    inspections conducted by the HGS respondents concern the alleged need for
    specific on-site quality control and other tests.  But under the terms of
    their retainer, the HGS respondents did not carry out, nor were they required
    to carry out, on-site tests or physical measurements during their inspections
    of the premises.  Rather, their inspections consisted of periodic reviews
    of the premises to ensure their general conformity with the design drawings.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    this court has recently held that the <i>Professional Engineers Act</i> does
    not create a private law duty of care owed by engineers to members of the
    public: see <i>1087086 Ontario Inc. v. Totten Sims Hubicki Associates (1997)
    Ltd.</i>, 2007 ONCA 627.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    all these circumstances, we agree with the motion judge that no genuine issue
    for trial arises in respect of the appellant’s claims against the HGS respondents.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appeal is dismissed.  The Subject Engineers are entitled to their costs of
    the appeal, fixed in the total amount of $7,000 for each of the HGS, Cochrane
    and Halsall respondents.</p>
