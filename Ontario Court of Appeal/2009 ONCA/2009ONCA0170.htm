  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    circumstances that frame our issue fall within narrow compass and involve
    a familiar trio: an altercation, retaliation, and innocent victims. </p>
  <h3>The Altercation</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One
    hot August night, Marquis Arlando Gordon (the appellant or Gordon) wanted
    to buy some marijuana. As Gordon and two friends walked along
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    St. Clair Avenue West, they approached the intersection of St. Clair and
    Harvie. A knot of pedestrians was standing on the street near L’<span lang=EN-US>Espresso
    Café and Bar. Among the pedestrians was André Thompson.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>One
      of Gordon’s friends thought that André Thompson was a drug dealer, a person
      who, for a price, could provide Gordon with the marijuana Gordon wanted
      to buy. Either the friend or Gordon offered Thompson $90 for an ounce of
      marijuana. Thompson was angered by the offer, which he considered “lowball”,
      and expressed his annoyance by punching both Gordon and his friend.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Gordon
      and his friends scattered in different directions after the abortive drug
      purchase.</span></p>
  <h3>The Shooting</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Within
    minutes of the altercation, a man dressed in black returned to the vicinity
    of L’Espresso Café. The man was carrying a sawed-off shotgun. Thompson and
    others were still hanging around the Café, standing on the sidewalk talking
    among themselves. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    sawed-off shotgun is easier to conceal and to manoeuvre than a weapon with
    a full-length barrel. Cutting down the barrel of a shotgun also increases
    the range over which pellets are dispersed when the weapon is fired.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    man in black fired three blasts from the sawed-off shotgun he carried, a
    12 gauge, semi-automatic or pump action model. Each shell contained at least
    152 and as many as 253 individual pellets. The shots were fired in the direction
    of <span lang=EN-US>André
    Thompson and those standing near him on the sidewalk around L’Espresso Café. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant was the person who fired the shotgun. </span></p>
  <h3>The Victims</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    the shooting began, Thompson ran into the bar, through the premises and out
    the back door. None of the pellets struck Thompson.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lina
    Pacheco and Christina Faria were standing on the sidewalk outside L’Espresso
    talking when the shooting began. Each was struck by several shotgun pellets.
    Ms. Pacheco was hit in the ear, head and face, chest and arm, and on her
    hand. Several pellets remain lodged in her body. Ms. Faria was struck by
    pellets in the face and neck, chest and right shoulder, arm, hand and wrist.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Antero
    Valentim was standing in an alcove talking on his cell phone four store fronts
    west of L’Espresso Café when he heard a shot. He stuck his head out of the
    alcove and was struck by pellets from a second shotgun blast. The pellets
    caused Valentim to lose his sight in one eye and most of his sight in the
    other eye. Several pellets remain embedded in his face.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE BASIS OF LIABILITY</span></h4>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      indictment on which the appellant was tried contained nine counts. For
      each victim struck by shotgun pellets, the appellant was charged with counts
      of attempted murder and aggravated assault. In relation to André Thompson,
      the appellant was charged with attempted murder, discharging a firearm
      with intent and pointing a firearm. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      jury found the appellant guilty of all counts. The trial judge invoked
      the principles articulated in <i>R. v. Kienapple</i>, [1975] 1 S.C.R. 729
      and entered conditional stays on all counts except those that charged attempted
      murder.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>The Position of the Prosecutor</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At
      trial, the prosecutor contended that the appellant was the shooter and
      that the offence he committed in relation to each named victim was attempted
      murder. To establish the <i>mens rea</i> of attempted murder, the prosecutor
      advanced the following bases of liability:</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'><span lang=EN-US>i.          in relation to André Thompson, an intention
      to kill him;</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'><span lang=EN-US>ii.         in relation to the injured victims, an intention
      to kill André         Thompson and the application of the common law doctrine

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'><span lang=EN-US>iii.       in relation to André Thompson  and the injured
      victims, an intention      to kill anyone who was standing outside L’Espresso
      Café when the        shots were fired.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-US>The principal basis advanced in connection with the injured victims

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      primary position of the appellant at trial was that he was not the shooter.
      The appellant’s experienced trial counsel sought a directed verdict of
      acquittal on all counts  on the basis that the evidence identifying the
      appellant as the shooter was insufficient to warrant submission of the
      case to the jury. The motion was dismissed.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant’s trial counsel brought a separate application for directed verdicts
      of acquittal on the attempted murder counts in relation to the three injured
      victims. On this motion, trial counsel advanced two arguments:</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'><span lang=EN-US>i.          that there was no evidence that the appellant
      intended to kill any            injured victim, either as an individual
      or a member of a group of persons standing outside the Café; and</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:

      permitting it, the     principles of transferred intent cannot found liability

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge concluded that the appellant’s liability for attempted murder
      in connection with the injured victims could be established through the
      application of the common law doctrine of transferred intent. In dismissing
      the application for a directed verdict on the attempted murder counts for
      the original victims, the trial judge said:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>But the ordinary and grammatical
      meaning of the phrases that I quoted are that an intention to kill at large
      is required, and that a specific intention to kill a particular person
      is not stated as a requirement of the offence of attempt murder.</span></p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>The Jury Instructions</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge opened his discussion of transferred intent with some general
      comments about the subject and some examples:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>            There is a legal doctrine
      known as,
    “transferred intent”. In the example that counsel gave you: If I tried to
    punch you and you ducked and I hit the person next to you I am still guilty
    of assault. The intent that the criminal law requires is transferred from
    the intended victim to the actual victim. </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'><span
lang=EN-US>…</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>            Now, quite apart from
      the issue of transferred intent on these counts you may also consider whether
      on all the evidence you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the
      shooter intended to cause harm, bodily harm, to all of the persons standing
      in front of the bar.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After
      concluding his instructions on the counts of aggravated assault, the trial
      judge focused the jurors’ attention on the manner in which the <i>mens
      rea</i> of attempted murder could be proven. He instructed the jurors in
      these terms:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>            For you to find Mr.
      Gordon guilty of attempted murder on counts 1, 3 and 5 you have to be satisfied
      that, firstly, that he was the shooter, satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt
      that he is the shooter. Secondly, that his conduct was an attempt. And,
      thirdly, that he had the specific intent to kill a person using a firearm.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>            I, again, instruct
      you, as a matter of law, that the conduct, if you are satisfied beyond
      a reasonable doubt that it occurred, the conduct of firing a shotgun at
      a person who need not be the bystander would constitute an attempt on these
      charges.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>            You also have to consider
      whether Mr. Gordon had the specific intent to kill a person. The evidence,
      in this case, does not support a finding that Mr. Gordon knew the three
      bystanders who are in the charges, but you should consider the doctrine
      of transferred intent. If you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that
      the shooter had the specific intent to kill a person, including any person
      other than the bystander, and his attempt to do so was effected upon the
      bystander, then as a matter of law the actual intent to kill the intended
      victim is transferred to the actual victim.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>            And, again, apart
      from the legal doctrine of transferred intent you should consider whether
      on the whole of the evidence you are satisfied that the shooter had the
      intention to kill all the persons standing in front of the bar.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>            I stress, though,
      that these charges are attempt murder. The Crown must satisfied beyond
      a reasonable doubt that he had the specific intent to kill a person. Nothing
      less will do.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'><span
lang=EN-US>…</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>            On each of counts
      1, 3 and 5 if you are satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that Mr. Gordon
      had the specific intent to kill, and made an attempt then you must find
      him guilty of attempted murder on the count that you’re considering, 1,
      3 or 5, on each of these counts. If you are not satisfied beyond a reasonable
      doubt that Mr. Gordon had the specific intent to kill and made an attempt
      then you must find him not guilty of attempted murder on that count.</span></p>

      Maunder for the appellant submits that the trial judge was wrong to instruct
      the jury that they could find the appellant guilty of the attempted murder
      of the injured victims in accordance with the doctrine of transferred intent,
      if they were satisfied that the appellant intended to kill André Thompson.</span></p>

      Maunder begins with a reminder about the text of s. 239 of the <i>Criminal
      Code</i>. The section does not define or create an offence, but rather
      confines its work to establishing a punishment for a specific inchoate
      crime, attempted murder. The provision gives off no scent of the availability
      of the principles of transferred intent to establish liability, either
      in express terms, as it does in ss. 229(b), 244 and 244.1, or by referential
      incorporation of the definition of murder. It follows, the argument continues,
      that s. 239 cannot be the source for transferred intent principles as a
      foundation for liability for attempted murder.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant similarly rejects the common law doctrine of transferred intent
      as a ground upon which liability for attempted murder may be established.
      No authority supports inclusion of transferred intent principles in determinations
      of liability for attempted murder. The doctrine, itself an aberration,
      is confined to crimes of general intent of which attempted murder is not
      one.</span></p>

      Maunder acknowledges, of course, that s. 8(2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> continues
      the pre-April 1, 1955, criminal law of
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">England</st1:country-region>
    in force in this province. She points out, however, that no case extends
    transferred intent principles, admittedly part of the criminal law incorporated
    by reference, to attempted murder. And further, the common (criminal) law
    thus incorporated is circumscribed by the proviso in s. 8(2): “except as
    altered, varied, modified or affected” by the <i>Code</i></span> or other
    federal statute. The <i>Code</i> <span
lang=EN-US>“</span>altered, varied, modified or affected” transferred intent
    principles by the device of their specific incorporation in offence–creating
    provisions. Their absence from s. 239 invokes the principle <i>expressio
    unius est exclusio alterius</i> and renders them inapplicable to the crime
    of attempted murder.</p>

    appellant also invokes criminal law policy considerations to buttress his
    position. In the legitimate application of transferred intent principles,
    transference of <i>mens rea</i> from the intended victim to the <i>actus
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    reus </i>in connection with the actual victim reflects more closely the moral
    culpability of the actor who causes the harm, as for example under s. 229(b).
    But in cases of inchoate homicide charged as attempted murder, of which bodily
    harm is not an essential ingredient, there is no <i>actus
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    reus </i>to which to transfer <i>mens rea</i>. And besides, the actor is
    already guilty of attempted murder of the intended victim. Labelling the
    offence committed in relation to persons injured as
    “attempted murder” offends fair labelling principles and does not accurately
    reflect the actor’s moral culpability.</p>

    the respondent, Mr. Lepofsky submits that transferred intent principles apply
    to crimes of inchoate homicide, like attempted murder, and were properly
    left as a basis for the appellant’s liability for attempted murder of the
    injured victims here.</p>

    Lepofsky characterizes the case for the application of transferred intent
    principles to the crime of attempted murder as compelling. The principle
    is deeply rooted in the common law, and thus in the criminal law referentially
    incorporated by s. 8(2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. The rationale underlying
    the principles is as applicable to attempted murder as it is to any other
    crime. These principles are not limited to crimes of general intent (witness
    their application to murder at common law), but extend to all crimes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent points out that failure to apply transferred intent principles
    to attempted murder would leave an irrational gap in serious offences against
    the person. The principles apply to aggravated assault and murder (of either
    classification), yet not to attempted murder, despite the moral culpabilities
    associated with it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

    Lepofsky contends that s. 8(2) continues the common law, at least the pre-April
    1, 1955, criminal common law of
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      England</st1:country-region>
    , despite the enactment of the<i> Criminal Code</i>.<i> </i>And so it is
    that transferred intent principles apply to crimes created by the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>, unless those principles are altered, varied, modified or affected
    by the offence-creating provisions. Section 239 does not oust or limit their
    application and their codification in ss. 229(b), 244 and 244.1 has no such
    effect either. Indeed, the mention of  “murder” in s. 239 could be said to
    incorporate the definition of murder in s. 229(b).</p>

    respondent rejects any suggestion that application of transferred intent
    principles to attempted murder contravenes sound criminal law policy. There
    is no unfair labelling in characterizing the appelant’s crime in relation
    to the injured victims as attempted murder, because such a label reflects
    the appellant’s moral culpability. Neither is there any unfair or inappropriate
    multiplying of intent. </p>

      Lepofsky advances an alternative submission if we determine that transferred

      the injured victims. The appellant concedes that  his conviction for the
      attempted murder of André Thompson cannot be disturbed, irrespective of
      any decision about transferred intent. Further, the appellant acknowledges
      that attempted murder was properly left to the jury on the basis of concurrent
      intent (the intent to kill those standing in front of L’Espresso Café).
      In the circumstances, the jury’s verdict would necessarily have been the
      same without the transferred intent instruction, thus the appeal should

      by joining the intent as to one victim with the harm caused to another
      victim, the purpose for which the doctrine was conceived. When the unintended
      victim has <i>not</i> suffered a fatal injury, the accused already has
      committed a completed crime against the intended victim, and the seriousness
      of that crime is as great as if the intent were transferred to the unintended
      victim:

    to one side the effect of the referential incorporation of the criminal common
    law by s. 8(2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, it is beyond question that Parliament
    could incorporate the principles of transferred intent by express language
    in offence-creating or defining sections. Likewise, Parliament, in express
    terms or by necessary implication, could exclude the application of such
    principles: <i>CLGP </i>at §46, pp. 127-8; LaFave <i>Substantive Criminal

      the parallel offences created by ss. 244 and 244.1, Parliament has distinguished
      between intended and actual victims by use of the indefinite adjective
      or determiner “any” and the specific terms “whether or not that person
      is the person mentioned in …”. The inclusion of the word “any”, depending
      on the context, may permit the introduction of the principles of transferred
      intent: see <i>CLGP </i>at § 46, p. 128. Like attempted murder, the offences
      of s. 244 and 244.1 do not require that anyone be injured by the accused’s
      discharge of a firearm or other weapon. </span></p>
  <h3>Attempted Murder Under the <i>Criminal Code</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is fundamental that at common law and under the <i>Criminal Code</i>, an
    attempt to commit a crime is itself an offence separate and distinct from
    the crime alleged to have been attempted: <i>R. v. Ancio, </i>[1984] 1 S.C.R.
    225, at p. 247. As with any substantive offence, to establish the inchoate
    crime of attempt, the prosecution must prove <i>mens rea</i>, the intent
    to commit the completed crime, and <i>actus
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    reus</i>, some step towards the commission of the completed crime beyond
    mere preparation. Of the two critical elements, <i>mens rea </i>and <i>actus
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    reus</i>, the more significant in attempts is <i>mens rea</i>: <i>Ancio </i>at
    p. 247; <i>R. v. Cline</i> (1956), 115 C.C.C. 18 at p. 27 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ). Indeed, the <i>actus
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    reus</i> of an attempt may but need not be a crime or even a tort. Injury
    to the victim is not an essential element of the crime of attempted murder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    its current state, s. 239 (like its predecessor, s. 210 of the 1953-54 <i>Code</i>)
    does <i>not</i> define or create the offence of attempted murder, but rather
    confines its work to the establishment of a penalty for a specific attempt
    that constitutes an exception to the general rule of s. 463.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite
    the categorization of the various means of committing attempted murder in
    the former s. 264, the reference to “any means”
    in the current s. 239 refers to the ways in which the crime of murder may
    be accomplished: <i>Ancio</i> at p. 250. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    229 defines murder by describing the states of mind that must accompany an
    unlawful killing to make that unlawful killing murder. The section has nothing
    to do with the means of killing. And so it is that, although the completed
    crime of murder may be committed without proof of an intent to kill, for
    example under s. 229(a)(ii), the inchoate crime of attempted murder requires
    proof of an intent to kill: <i>Ancio</i> at pp. 250-251.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    seems clear from <i>Ancio</i> that, since the mental element in attempted
    murder is restricted to an intention to kill, the provisions of s. 229, which
    define the mental element required for the completed crime of murder, cannot
    be relied upon to establish guilt of attempted murder: <i>Droste</i> at p.
    218. This prohibition would bar access to s. 229(b) for a similar purpose. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    239 of the present <i>Code</i>, like s. 210 of the 1953-54 <i>Code</i>, includes
    the words “attempts by any means to commit murder”. The current section omits
    reference to “any person”, a common inclusion in several paragraphs of s.
    264 of the 1927 <i>Code </i>that disappeared in the 1953-54 revision, and
    a phrase sufficiently expansive to permit the introduction of transferred
    intent: <i>CLGP</i> at §46, p. 128.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    doctrine of transferred intent was part of the criminal common law of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">England</st1:country-region>
    incorporated in Canadian criminal law by the provisions of s. 7(1) of the
    1953-54 <i>Code</i> and continued by current s. 8(2). The referential incorporation
    is not, however, unqualified: the common law only continues to the extent
    that it is not modified, altered, varied or affected by the <i>Code</i> or
    other federal enactment. That said, the common law has frequently been invoked
    despite statutory provisions dealing with similar subject-matter.</p>
  <h3>The Principles Applied</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge instructed the jury that if they were satisfied beyond a reasonable
    doubt that the appellant intended to kill <i>a</i> person, including anyone
    other than a bystander, they could find the appellant guilty of attempted
    murder of the bystanders on the basis of transferred intent. No such instruction
    was given in connection with the count relating to <span lang=EN-US>André Thompson,
    the person who had previously assaulted the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>If
      transferred intent principles are to apply to the crime of attempted murder,
      the application must be otherwise than through the express or implied terms
      of s. 239 of the<i> Criminal Code</i>. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Section
      239 does <i>not</i> define or create the offence of attempted murder. The
      section simply fixes the penalty for the specific inchoate crime of attempted
      murder: <i>Ancio </i>at p. 403.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Like
      any crime, inchoate or completed, attempted murder requires proof of both <i>mens
      rea</i> and <i>actus
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    reus</i>. The <i>mens rea</i> of attempted murder is the intent to kill.
    The mere fact that the completed crime, murder, may be established by proof
    of a mental element (<i>mens rea</i>) less than an intent to kill does not
    mean that any <i>mens rea</i> less than an intent to kill will be sufficient
    for attempted murder: <i>Ancio</i> at p. 250-251.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The
      definition of murder contained in s. 229(b) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> incorporates
      transferred intent principles. But the mere fact that the completed crime
      of murder may be proven on this basis says nothing about the application
      of the same principles to the inchoate crime of attempted murder. Indeed,
      it could be said that where Parliament wishes to create an offence by the
      application of transferred intent principles it says so in specific language.
      It did not do so in s. 239.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    common law doctrine of transferred intent takes the <i>mens rea</i> of an
    offence in relation to an intended victim and transfers it to the <i>actus
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    reus </i>of the same offence committed upon another victim. Considered separately,
    each prospective crime lacks an essential part. The m<i>ens rea</i> (intended
    victim) lacks an <i>actus
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    reus</i>. And the <i>actus
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    reus </i> (actual victim) lacks <i>mens rea</i>. In combination, however,
    they amount to a whole crime through the application of a legal fiction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, a close examination of the principles that underlie the doctrine
    of transferred intent compels the conclusion that this common law doctrine
    does not apply to the inchoate crime of attempt, in particular to attempted
    murder, and thus cannot be part of our law through the operation of s. 8(2)
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is at best debatable whether the principles of transferred intent apply to
    the inchoate crime of attempt: <i>CLGP</i> at §46, p. 128 and §199, p. 620.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    every crime, inchoate or substantive, involves both <i>mens rea</i> and an <i>actus
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    reus</i>. The <i>actus
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    reus </i>of many but not all crimes may include an element of harm, as for
    example the crimes of unlawful homicide. In most cases, including offences
    against the person, the <i>mens rea</i> and <i>actus
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    reus</i> relate to the same victim. When transferred intent principles are
    in play, however, the <i>mens rea</i> relates to an intended victim and the <i>actus
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    reus</i> relates to the actual victim. The principles connect a culpable
    mental state in relation to one with a result or harm visited upon another.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    principles underlying transferred intent apply to crimes that require a result
    as part of the<i> actus
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    reus</i>, for example, death of a human being in cases of unlawful homicide.
    But inchoate crimes in general, and attempted murder in particular, do <i>not </i>require
    a result or harm as part of their <i>actus
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    reus</i>. The <i>actus
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    reus</i> is complete upon the first act beyond preparation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    no modern and reasoned authority is offered to support the claim that transferred
    intent principles apply to the crime of attempted murder. The decision in <i>R.
    v. Ménard</i> (1961), 130 C.C.C. 242 (Que.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), seems to favour the contrary view (that transferred intent principles
    do not apply to attempted murder), although the decision may be better regarded
    as one that turns on the specific allegations contained in the indictment. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, if the appellant intended to kill <span
lang=EN-US>André Thompson and, by accident or mistake, killed one or more bystanders,
    the unlawful homicide would be murder under s. 229(b). But it by no means
    follows that the appellant’s crime is attempted murder where the bystanders
    were injured but not killed, although it would be murder if they died:  <i>Ancio</i> at
    p. 250.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Third,
      the application of transferred intent principles to the crime of attempted
      murder may extend liability unduly and foster irrational distinctions.
      X shoots at Y intending to kill him. In the vicinity of Y are several others.
      All hear the shot, but none are injured. How far do we extend the scope
      of liability on the basis of transferred intent?  If someone is injured,
      a bystander, is X guilty of attempted murder of that person on the basis
      of transferred intent? And, if so, are we making a distinction on the basis
      of a consequence that is immaterial to liability for attempted murder
    – injury or harm?  Recourse to a legal fiction in these circumstances is
    scarcely necessary to fairly label and punish the crimes committed.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Fourth,
      in crimes of attempt, it is not necessary to make a whole crime out of
      two halves by joining the intent in relation to one victim with the harm
      caused to another, the purpose that underlies the principle. When the unintended
      victim suffers <i>no </i>harm, the accused has already committed an inchoate
      crime in relation to the intended victim, a crime of the same level of
      gravity as if the intent were to be transferred under the doctrine. Leaving
      aside principles of concurrent intent, the accused may also be punished
      in connection with the unintended victim according to his moral culpability
      and the injury he or she has caused.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Finally,
      consummated criminal homicides are, in the last analysis, <i>sui generis</i>.
      Many of their complexities, of which the transferred intent doctrine (or
      its statutory surrogate) is one, simply do not travel well to other climes,
      especially those where harm is not a constituent of the <i>actus
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    reus</i>. Moreover, no necessity exists forcing the transferred intent doctrine
    to march into territory other than that of actual, consummated criminal homicides.
    For the remainder, the actuality of the real <i>mens rea</i>, together with
    its precisely related <i>actus
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    reus</i>,<i> </i>is enough to establish guilt at the appropriate level without
    any need to resort to an intention – shifting legal fiction:  <i>Harvey v.

      the result, I am satisfied that the trial judge erred in law in instructing
      the jury that they could find the appellant guilty of attempted murder
      of the three injured bystanders on the basis of transferred intent.</span></p>
  <h3>The Effect of the Misdirection</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the attempted murder counts relating to the injured victims, the trial judge
    instructed the jury that they could find the appellant guilty of attempted
    murder on the basis of transferred intent as well as concurrent intent. As
    a matter of law, the appellant’s liability for attempted murder of the injured
    victims could <i>not</i> be established through the application of principles
    of transferred intent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    jurors also found the appellant guilty of the attempted murder of <span lang=EN-US>André
    Thompson. To reach that conclusion, they must have been satisfied that the
    appellant intended to kill Thompson, the man who had assaulted him when the
    appellant sought to purchase some marijuana. And it was the intent to kill
    Thompson that engaged the principles of transferred intent.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>In
      the circumstances of this case, I am unable to conclude that the jury’s
      verdict on the attempted murder counts in relation to the injured victims
      would necessarily have been the same without the instructions on transferred
      intent.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The
      catalyst in the entire series of events that culminated in the shotgun
      blasts was Thompson’s assault of the appellant. The assault provided a
      motive for the appellant to retaliate, and thus assisted in his identification
      as the shooter. The most logical target was Thompson. It seems inconceivable,
      especially in light of the jury’s decision that the appellant attempted
      to murder Thompson, that transferred intent did not figure prominently
      in their deliberations in relation to the injured victims.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>In
      my view, the convictions of attempted murder of each of the three injured
      victims cannot stand. Those convictions should be set aside. The conviction
      for the attempted murder of André Thompson is unaffected by the error in
      leaving transferred intent to the jury and the appeal against that conviction
      should be dismissed. </span></p>

      jury also found the appellant guilty of three counts of aggravated assault
      in connection with each injured victim. In light of the convictions for
      attempted murder, the trial judge entered conditional stays on each of
      the aggravated assault counts. In the circumstances here, I would set aside
      those stays, enter convictions of aggravated assault and impose sentences
      of imprisonment for eight years on each count to be served concurrently
      with each other and with the sentence imposed on the conviction of attempted
