    appeal involves a priority dispute between a secured creditor who holds perfected
    security interests under the <i>Personal Property Security Act</i>, R.S.O.
    1990, c. P.10 (the “PPSA”) in two highway tractor trucks and an automobile
    insurer who is entitled to salvage rights in the same vehicles under statutory
    condition 6(7) in <i>Statutory Conditions – Automobile Insurance</i>, O.
    Reg. 777/93 passed under the <i>Insurance Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8, as
    amended (the “Insurance Act”).  At issue is the interplay between s. 4(1)(c)
    of the PPSA, which excludes “a transfer of an interest or claim in or under
    any policy of insurance” from the application of the PPSA, and statutory
    condition 6(7) of the Insurance Act, which affords an insurer the right to
    salvage in an insured vehicle in certain circumstances.  We are also required
    to determine whether ss. 28(1) or 25(1) of the PPSA operate in this case
    to determine the priority contest between the parties.</p>

    appellant, GE Canada Equipment Financing G.P. (“GE”), an asset-backed lender,
    leases or conditionally sells various types of collateral, including highway
    tractor trucks.  The respondent, ING Insurance Company of
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    (“ING”), offers a range of insurance products and services to the public,
    including automobile insurance.  At the relevant time, Brampton Leasing and
    Rentals Limited (“
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place

    Brampton”) was in the vehicle leasing and rental business, operating as a

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Brampton in its leasing and rental business.  In particular, on September
    18, 2002 and November 18, 2004, GE entered into two conditional sale agreements
    (the “CSAs”) with Brampton, whereby GE financed Brampton’s acquisition of
    two highway tractor trucks manufactured in 2003 and 2005 (referred to in
    these reasons as the “2003 Truck”, the “2005 Truck” or, collectively, the “Trucks”).</p>

    the terms of the CSAs: (i) GE was named as the “assignee” and Brampton was
    named as the “purchaser” of the Trucks; (ii) GE remained the owner of and
    held title to the Trucks until they were paid for in full; (iii) Brampton
    was required to place and maintain comprehensive first party all risks insurance
    on the Trucks for their full replacement value, to name GE as a beneficiary
    in the insurance policies so obtained, and to ensure that the policies contained
    a waiver of subrogation clause in favour of GE; and (iv) while not in default

    default under the CSAs.  On March 14, 2007, GE obtained used vehicle information
    packages for the Trucks from the Ministry of Transportation, which indicated
    that ING was the registered owner of the 2003 Truck and that it had owned,
    and subsequently sold, the 2005 Truck.  The packages also identified GE as
    a “secured party” and a registered lienholder in relation to both Trucks.</p>

  <h2>(3)       The Litigation </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Despite
    demand therefor, ING refused to surrender possession of the 2003 Truck or
    to pay the proceeds from the sale of the 2005 Truck to GE.  As a result,
    GE commenced proceedings against ING, applying for declarations that: (i)
    its PMSIs in the Trucks had priority over ING’s rights to salvage in the
    same vehicles; and (ii) it was entitled to the return of the Trucks or, in
    the case of the 2005 Truck, to the proceeds of sale thereof, from ING.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>ING
    resisted GE’s application on two grounds.  It maintained that its salvage
    rights flowed from the ING policies, which incorporated statutory condition
    6(7) of the Insurance Act, and that the PPSA did not apply to its interests
    in the Trucks by virtue of s. 4(1)(c) of the PPSA and statutory condition
    6(7) of the Insurance Act.  ING also argued that as the Transfer was a “[sale]
    in the ordinary course of business”, the PPSA did not apply by operation
    of s.&nbsp;28(1) of the PPSA.  On both grounds, ING asserted that it took
    title to the Trucks free from GE’s pre-existing perfected PMSIs in the Trucks.</p>

    order dated February 4, 2008, the application judge dismissed GE’s application
    and, on consent, awarded costs to ING in the total amount of $15,000, plus
    interest.  The core of his reasoning was as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>As a matter of priority, the PPSA, in effect, has
    stated that GE is not to have priority over transfers of interest to ING
    by reason of the operation of Statutory Condition 6(7) which is incorporated
    into insurance policies.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><u>Conclusion</u></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I find that GE’s interest in the vehicles <i>vis
      a vis</i> ING is not protected by the PPSA for the reason that [the] PPSA
      does not apply to a transfer of an interest under a policy of insurance
      [s. 4(1)(c) of the PPSA].  There was such a transfer of an interest by
      virtue of Statutory Condition 6(7).</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Given
    this conclusion, the application judge regarded it as unnecessary to address
    ING’s s. 28(1) PPSA argument.  In contrast to its position on this appeal,
    ING did not rely on s. 25(1) of the PPSA in the proceeding before the application
    judge.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    would frame the issues on appeal this way: do ING’s salvage rights in the
    Trucks have priority over GE’s pre-existing perfected PMSIs in the Trucks
    and their proceeds by operation of: (i) s. 4(1)(c) of the PPSA and statutory
    condition 6(7) of the Insurance Act; (ii) s. 28(1) of the PPSA; or (iii)
    s. 25(1) of the PPSA?</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>GE
    advances two main arguments in support of its claim that its PMSIs have priority
    over ING’s salvage rights.  It submits that the application judge erred by
    concluding that the combined operation of s. 4(1)(c) of the PPSA and statutory
    condition 6(7) of the Insurance Act resulted in title to the Trucks vesting
    in ING free from GE’s perfected PMSIs in the Trucks and their proceeds.  GE
    also asserts that neither s.&nbsp;28(1) nor s.&nbsp;25(1) of the PPSA are
    engaged in this case since, in the case of s. 28(1), the Transfer was not
    a “[sale] in the ordinary course of business” and, in the case of s. 25(1),
    GE did not expressly or impliedly authorize the Transfer.  I will address
    these arguments in turn.</p>

    begin, I note that the issues on appeal relate to the interpretation of the

    PPSA is provincial chattel security legislation designed to protect the rights
    of creditors and debtors by regularizing secured transactions in personal
    property.  To achieve this objective, the PPSA establishes a province-wide,
    notice-based registration system.  Under this system, the first creditor
    to register notice of a security interest in a debtor’s personal property
    generally has a first priority secured interest in that property that is
    effective against third parties, including other secured creditors: see <i>Royal
    Bank of Canada (Administrative agent for certain lenders) v. 1231640 Ontario
    Inc. (Trustee of)</i>, 2007 ONCA 810, at para. 4 <i>per</i> Weiler J.A. (in
    dissent, but not on this point), leave to appeal to S.C.C. granted, [2008]
    S.C.C.A. No. 34.  The purpose of such legislation was described by Gonthier
    J. (dissenting on other grounds) in <i>Royal Bank of Canada v. Sparrow Electric
    Corp.</i>, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 411, at para. 21:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[P]rovincial legislatures have moved to protect
    secured creditors generally through the enactment of personal property security
    legislation … These statutory regimes have been implemented to increase certainty
    and predictability in secured transactions through the creation of a coherent
    system of priorities … The benefits of such certainty in commercial transactions,
    on basic economic principles, are intended to accrue to the health of the
    economy in general.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section
    2 of the PPSA delineates the scope of the statute:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Subject to subsection 4(1), this Act applies to,</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>every
    transaction without regard to its form and without regard to the person who
    has title to the collateral that in substance creates a security interest
    including, without limiting the foregoing,</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>a … conditional

    assignment, lease or consignment that secures payment or performance of an
    obligation;</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>Thus, under s. 2(a) and subject
    to s. 4(1), the PPSA applied to GE’s security interests in the Trucks, as
    created under the CSAs. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    central priorities rule under the PPSA is set out in s. 9(1): “<i>Except
    as other-wise provided by this or any other Act</i>, a security agreement
    is effective according to its terms between the parties to it and against
    third parties” (emphasis added).  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this case, GE’s PMSIs in the Trucks were perfected by registration under
    the PPSA before the issuance of the ING policies and the Transfer.  As a
    result, under the s.&nbsp;9(1) priorities rule, GE’s PMSIs have priority
    over the interests of all third parties with a subsequently acquired interest
    in the secured collateral.  The issue, therefore, is whether s. 4(1)(c) of
    the PPSA and statutory condition 6(7) of the Insurance Act, alone or in combination,
    constitute an exception to the s. 9(1) PPSA priorities rule, such that ING’s
    salvage rights in the Trucks overtake the priority of GE’s PMSIs in the same
    collateral.  </p>
  <h2><i>(ii)       Section 4(1)(c) PPSA exclusion</i></h2>

    4(1)(c) of the PPSA excludes transfers of
    “an interest or claim in or under any policy of insurance” from the application
    of the PPSA.  Jacob S. Ziegel and David L. Denomme, in <i>The Ontario Personal
    Property Security Act: Commentary and Analysis</i>, 2<span style='font-family:
&quot;Times New \(W1\)&quot;;'>nd</span> ed. (Toronto and Vancouver: Butterworths,
    2000) at p. 82, citing F.M. Catzman, Q.C., <i>Personal Property Security
    Law in Ontario</i> (Toronto: Carswell, 1976) at p. 35, explain the rationale
    for the s. 4(1)(c) exclusion in this fashion:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The drafters of the original Ontario Act rationalized
    the exclusion of security interests in insurance policies on the ground that
    the insurer maintains records of title and claims to policies and contracts
    issued by it and that there was no need for a separate registry.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus,
    the purpose of s. 4(1)(c) is to avoid the unnecessary duplication of notice
    systems concerning transfers that create interests or claims in or under
    insurance policies.  This is achieved by excluding such interests or claims
    from the PPSA notice and registration scheme.  Simply put, notice under the
    PPSA is not required to perfect a security interest falling within the ambit
    of s. 4(1)(c).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

      Inc. (Re)</i>, 2005 CanLII 13192 (ON C.A.), this court was concerned with
      whether an assignment of unearned premium under an insurance premium financing
      contract came within the s. 4(1)(c) exclusion.  Justice Weiler, writing
      for the court, examined the scope of s. 4(1)(c) and noted that its purpose
      is to exempt certain items of commerce from the notice and registration
      requirements of the PPSA.  She commented, at paras. 10, 15, 21-22 and 24:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[Section] 4(1)(c) deals specifically with transfers
    of interests or claims in insurance policies.  It does not deal with “other
    items of commerce”
    and these are not exempted [from the application of the PPSA].</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:
center'>….</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The wording of the exclusion in s. 4(1)(c) is clear
    and should be read as including the assignment of unearned premium under
    a policy of insurance.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><i>In
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario, interpreting s. 4(1) as exempting [the premium financier] from registering
    its right to receive any unearned insurance premium leads one to s. 138 of
    the Insurance Act</i> [which provides for notice of an insured’s assignment
    of the right to refund of premium under a contract of insurance].</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>This is not to say that s. 138 gives [the premium
    financier] the right to priority over other secured lenders.  To determine
    priorities, resort to the common law or to the provisions of the <i>Bankruptcy
    and Insolvency Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 would be necessary and that issue
    awaits another day.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[The premium financier] has an interest in the unearned
    premiums that were transferred to it by virtue of the [con-tracts in issue]

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    effect of s. 4(1)(c) in this case, therefore, was to relieve ING of the obligation
    to protect its interests under the ING policies by providing notice of those
    interests in the PPSA registry.  But s. 4(1)(c) did no more.  It did not
    relieve ING of the requirement to be mindful of the PPSA-protected interests
    of secured creditors.  Nothing in the language of s. 4(1)(c) suggests that
    it is intended to resolve priority disputes between creditors, including
    priority competitions between a creditor with a perfected security interest
    under the PPSA (like GE) and a creditor whose interest in collateral is exempt
    from the notice and registration requirements of the PPSA (like ING).</p>

    a consideration of the language of s. 4(1)(c) in the context of its purpose
    indicates that s. 4(1)(c) is not concerned with priorities at all.  The words
    of Professors Ziegel and Denomme at p. 116 of their above-cited text, although
    addressing another exclusion from the PPSA under s. 4(1)(a), apply with equal
    force to s. 4(1)(c):  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[Section] 4(1)(a) means not only that the Act has
    nothing to say about the creation and perfection of non-consensual security
    interests but also that <i>it does not regulate priorities between PPSA security
    interests and non-PPSA interests</i>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly,
    since s. 4(1)(c) of the PPSA does not address priorities, it does not operate
    to oust the priority otherwise conferred on GE’s PMSIs by s. 9(1) of the
    PPSA.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    conclusion is bolstered by the nature of the transaction at issue.  GE submits
    that s. 4(1)(c) does not apply to resolve the priority contest between the
    parties because the Transfer did not “in substance create a security interest” in
    or under an insurance policy or amounts payable under an insurance policy.  Thus,
    it is contended that the Transfer did not fall within the ambit of s. 4(1)(c).  I

    – the predecessor provision to current UCC 9-109(d)(8) – was identical to
    that of s. 4(1)(c) of the PPSA.  The ambit of UCC 9-104(g) was interpreted
    by American courts as limited to direct interests created in an insurance
    policy by making the policy itself the collateral securing the transaction
    in question.  Thus, for example, in <i>Paskow v. Calvert Fire Insurance Co.</i> 579
    F. 2d 949, 953 (5<span style='font-family:&quot;Times New \(W1\)&quot;;
'>th</span> Cir. 1979), the court explained that UCC 9-104(g) was “directed not
    at the insurance of collateral but the creation of a security interest <i>in
    an insurance policy</i>”
    (emphasis added).  See also <i>PPG Industries v. Hartford Fire Ins. Co.</i> 531

    Transfer in this case was not a secured transaction – it did not create an
    interest that secured payment or performance of an obligation.  Nor did it
    create a security interest “in or under an insurance policy”, including in
    respect of amounts payable under an insurance policy, so as to trigger the
    application of s. 4(1)(c) of the PPSA.  Rather, it involved the purported
    transfer of ownership in the Trucks to ING in exchange for full indemnification
    under the ING policies on the basis of a total loss claim.</p>

    note that GE makes no claim to the ING policies or their proceeds.  Its claims
    are to the collateral secured by the CSAs – the Trucks – and, in the case
    of the 2005 Truck, to the proceeds of sale realized by ING, in respect of
    which GE holds PPSA<span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>-</span>protected security interests.  GE’s claims, therefore, are unaffected
    by s. 4(1)(c).  Its claims are based on “PPSA security interests” in the
    Trucks and, in respect of the 2005 Truck, in its proceeds.  In contrast,
    ING’s interests in or under the ING policies and its salvage rights in the
    Trucks are “non-PPSA interests”.  </p>

    all these circumstances, I agree with GE’s submission that s. 4(1)(c) does
    not operate in this case to determine the priorities between GE’s PPSA security
    interests in the Trucks and their proceeds and ING’s non-PPSA salvage rights
    in the Trucks.  Section 4(1)(c) simply has no bearing on that key issue.</p>

    that does not end the matter.  In the application judge’s view, it was the
    combined operation of s. 4(1)(c) and statutory condition 6(7) that determined
    this priority contest.  Recall that he held that GE’s interest in the vehicles, “is
    not protected by the PPSA for the reason that [the] PPSA does not apply to
    a transfer of an interest under a policy of insurance” and “There was such
    a transfer of an interest by virtue of Statutory Condition 6(7).”  I turn
    now to consideration of statutory condition 6(7).  </p>
  <h2><i>(iii)     Statutory condition 6(7)</i></h2>

    total loss cases.  In such cases, an insurer is entitled to the salvage,
    if any, in the lost automobile where it elects to replace or pay the actual
    cash value of the automobile.  In <i>David Polowin Real Estate Ltd. v. Dominion
    of Canada General Insurance Co.</i> (2005), 76 O.R. (3d) 161, at para. 54,
    leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [2005] S.C.C.A. No. 388, this court explained
    that statutory condition 6(7) affords an insurer three options where an insured
    vehicle is a total loss:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>First, the insurer can replace the insured’s car
    and take title to the salvage.  It is entitled to the salvage because otherwise,
    its insured will be over-indemnified.  Second, it can pay the actual cash
    value of the car and take title to the salvage.  Again, the insurer claims
    entitlement to the salvage to prevent over-indemnification.  Third, it can
    elect to leave the salvage with the insured, in which case the insured’s
    loss would not be the actual cash value of the car but its diminution in
    value.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this case, the Trucks were lost through theft.  On proof of loss, ING exercised
    the second option described in <i>Polowin</i> – it paid
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Brampton and the third party lessees the actual cash value of the Trucks,
    less applicable deductibles, in exchange for the Transfer.  Having satisfied
    its indemnity obligations under the ING policies in full, ING became entitled
    under statutory condition 6(7) to title to any salvage in the Trucks.  But
    this does not mean that statutory condition 6(7) operates to vest title to
    the salvage in ING, free and clear of pre-existing perfected security interests
    in the Trucks.  I say this for several reasons.</p>

    the concepts of priority and salvage are not the same.  Statutory condition
    6(7) does not refer to priorities, the interests of secured creditors, or
    the PPSA.  It refers to the right to salvage in respect of a total loss insured
    vehicle.  A plain reading of statutory condition 6(7) offers no support for
    ING’s contention that it is intended, alone or in combination with s. 4(1)(c)
    of the PPSA, to extinguish a creditor’s pre-existing perfected security interest
    in a vehicle that becomes the subject of a total loss claim.  For example,
    statutory condition 6(7) does not contain the words
    “notwithstanding any security interest in the vehicle”.  It is, of course,
    open to the legislature to create a right that extinguishes or subordinates
    the pre-existing perfected security interests of third parties.  But if this
    were the intent of statutory condition 6(7), it could easily have been accomplished
    by the use of explicit priorities language.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    conclusion is fortified by the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Sparrow</i>.  In
    that case, Iacobucci J., writing for a majority of the court, confirmed at
    paras. 106 and 112, that clear and unambiguous language is required to extinguish
    the rights of a secured creditor in respect of collateral:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Parliament has shown that it knows how to assert
    priority over rival security interests … All that is needed to overtake a
    fixed and specific charge is clear language to that effect.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Finally, I wish to emphasize that it is open to
    Parliament to step in and assign absolute priority to the deemed trust.  A
    clear illustration of how this might be done is afforded by s.&nbsp;224(1.2)
    [of the <i>Income Tax Act</i>], which vests certain moneys in the Crown “notwithstanding
    any security interest in those moneys” and provides that they “shall be paid
    to the Receiver General in priority to any such security interest”.  All
    that is needed to effect the desired result is clear language of that kind.  [Citations

    contrast to the explicit Crown priority provision referenced in <i>Sparrow</i>,
    statutory condition 6(7) is devoid of any express or implied indicators of
    a legislative intent to affect the perfected security interest of a secured
    creditor in an insured vehicle that is lost to an insured.  In my view, to
    read such an intent into statutory condition 6(7) in the absence of clear
    and unequivocal language evidencing such a legislative objective would constitute
    an unwarranted extension of the scope of an insurer’s salvage rights.</p>

    and importantly, statutory condition 6(7) represents a statutory codifi-cation
    of the common law right of subrogation.  In <i>Polowin</i>, Laskin J.A.,
    writing for a unanimous court, held at para. 82 that an insurer’s right to
    claim salvage under statutory condition 6(7),
    “amounts to the exercise of the right of subrogation after fully indemnifying
    the insured for the insured’s loss”.  He later added at para. 100: “Once
    an insured has been fully indemnified for the loss, the right to salvage
    is simply the exercise of the right of subrogation to prevent over-indemnification
    [of the insured].”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Subrogation
    is a derivative right that rests on the principle of indemnification.  It
    contemplates that on full indemnification of an insured by an insurer for
    an insured loss, the insurer becomes entitled to exercise a right belonging
    to the insured.  In <i>Insurance Law</i> (
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto: Irwin Law, 2004), Denis Boivin states at pp. 280, 282 and 284:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Subrogation arises when the insured has an enforceable
    right against someone other than his or her insurer – a right that would
    allow the insured to recover the losses caused by the peril, in part or in
    their entirety.  Subrogation allows the insurer to enforce this right in
    the name of the insured and to withhold from the resulting award the equivalent
    of any indemnity paid under the insurance contract.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left;'>….</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><u>The insurer must be placed in the exact same
      position as the insured</u>.  The insurer must have access to <i>all</i> the
      rights and remedies of the insured with respect to the insured object …</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left;'>….</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><u>Subrogation is a derivative right – that is,
      it depends entirely on the rights of the insured.</u></p>

    other words, under the principle of subrogation, the insurer succeeds only
    to the exact right otherwise enjoyed by its insured.  This is not a new proposition.  It
    has long been recognized that under the right of subrogation, the insurer
    must be placed in the position of its insured.  For this reason, the discussion
    in <i>Polowin</i> of an insurer’s exercise of the right of subrogation under
    statutory condition 6(7) recognizes that prior to the insurer’s election
    to trigger statutory condition 6(7), the right to salvage in an insured vehicle
    is a property right of the insured.  Where, however, the insurer pays the
    insured’s total loss claim in respect of the insured vehicle, it becomes
    entitled to all the salvage rights that the insured possessed in respect
    of the insured vehicle.  Statutory condition 6(7), therefore, is concerned
    with an insurer’s right to salvage as against its insured.</p>

    application judge does not appear to have considered the implications of
    the principle of subrogation in the context of statutory condition 6(7).  Instead,
    relying on <i>Re Giffen</i>, [1998] 1 S.C.R. 91, he concluded that the dispute
    between GE and ING could not be resolved on the basis of the examination
    of Brampton’s rights in respect of the Trucks or the determination of who
    has title to the vehicles, “because the dispute is one of priority to the
    vehicles and not ownership in them”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    agree that we are concerned here with the priorities as between GE’s and
    ING’s interests in the Trucks.  I also agree that the question of title to
    or ownership of collateral is not determinative of priorities under the PPSA:
    see for example, <i>Giffen</i>, at para. 26.   However, the pertinent issue
    is the reach of ING’s rights under statutory condition 6(7).     </p>

    statutory condition 6(7), where an insurer decides to replace or pay the
    actual cash value of a total loss vehicle, the salvage in the vehicle, if
    any, vests in the insurer by operation of law.  Where, as here, the prerequisites
    to the invocation of statutory condition 6(7) are met, the issue is whether
    any salvage is in fact available for the benefit of the insurer.  In some
    cases, no salvage will exist.  For this reason, statutory condition 6(7)
    refers to salvage, “if any”.  Where salvage is available, the issue is whether
    the insurer’s salvage right has priority over pre-existing perfected security
    interests in the vehicle in respect of which the salvage right arises.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Where – as
    here – salvage is available, the principle of subrogation that underlies
    statutory condition 6(7) and the requirement of indemnification on which
    that principle rests, mandate that an insurer who replaces or pays the actual
    cash value of an automobile in a total loss case steps into the shoes of
    the insured in relation to the right to salvage.  The insurer is only entitled
    under the subrogation principle to the salvage right that was enjoyed by
    its insured prior to the insurer’s decision to invoke statutory condition
    6(7).  </p>

    other words, statutory condition 6(7) does not increase the rights of an
    insurer against third parties beyond those enjoyed by its insured, or create
    new rights in the insurer not previously possessed by its insured.  The ‘vesting’
    of salvage rights that occurs under statutory condition 6(7) involves the
    conveyance of salvage rights as between an insurer and its insured.  That
    transfer may be subject to the interests of the insured’s secured creditors.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    conclusion accords with both commercial and common sense.  If ING’s assertion
    of priority is accepted, it would mean that a debtor whose vehicle was subject
    to the perfected security interest of a secured creditor could defeat that
    interest by the simple device of purchasing automobile insurance on the secured
    vehicle.  In the subsequent event of the total loss of the vehicle, the interest
    of the secured creditor could be extinguished, without recourse, at the unilateral
    election of the debtor’s insurer.  This result would offend the principle
    of subrogation.  It would permit a debtor’s insurer to enjoy greater rights
    in the insured collateral than the debtor itself possessed.  This is not
    a reasonable result.  It is, therefore, to be avoided unless a legislative
    intent to effect such a result is evident.  No such intent is manifest in
    statutory condition 6(7).</p>

    application judge relied on <i>Chrysler Credit Canada  v. Fehr</i> (2001),
    55 O.R. (3d) 430 (S.C.) for the proposition that an insurer’s entitlement
    to salvage under statutory condition 6(7) “was exempt from a claim under
    the PPSA”.  In so doing, he adverted to the following passage from <i>Chrysler
    Credit</i>, at para. 11:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The issue before me is not one of a transfer of
    an interest in a policy of automobile insurance.  The issue before me does
    not include an insurer’s right under [s. 6(7)] of the statutory conditions,
    which are incorporated in the policy, to acquire title to the salvage.  Accordingly,
    the PPSA does not apply to the insurer’s right to acquire the salvage of
    the collateral.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    acknowledge that many of the facts in <i>Chrysler Credit</i> are analogous
    to those in this case.  However, <i>Chrysler Credit</i> is distinguishable
    from the case at bar in several pivotal respects.  Unlike this case, <i>Chrysler
    Credit</i> involved a claim by a secured creditor for entitlement to the
    proceeds of an insurance policy on a destroyed vehicle after the debtor’s
    insurer had paid the debtor for the vehicle loss.  That is not this case.  As
    I have emphasized, GE makes no claim to the proceeds of the ING policies.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    s. 258(3) of the Insurance Act was crucial to the decision in <i>Chrysler
    Credit</i>.  That provision deals with the application of insurance money
    payable under an automobile insurance policy.  It provides that an insured’s
    creditor is not entitled to share in the insurance money payable under the
    policy unless the creditor’s claim is “one for which indemnity is provided
    for by [the policy]”.  As there was no evidence that Chrysler Credit was
    a named insured or loss payee under the policy in question, it was precluded
    under s. 258(3) from claiming entitlement to the insurance proceeds and was
    restricted to its contractual rights against the debtor.  Section 258(3)
    of the Insurance Act does not apply in this case, as GE seeks to obtain the
    secured collateral and proceeds from the sale of part of the secured collateral,
    rather than the proceeds of the ING policies themselves.</p>

    in my view, <i>Chrysler Credit</i> does not hold that an insurer’s right
    to salvage has priority over a secured party’s interests in the automobile
    that gives rise to the salvage rights.  Rather, the passage from <i>Chrysler
    Credit</i> relied on by the application judge concerns the rights of an insurer,
    as against its insured, to obtain salvage rights in insured collateral.  In
    that context, <i>Chrysler Credit</i> holds that s. 4(1)(c) of the PPSA does
    not apply to an insurer’s salvage rights.  </p>

    would summarize my conclusions concerning s. 4(1)(c) of the PPSA and statutory
    condition 6(7) of the Insurance Act as follows: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(i)    Section 4(1)(c) and statutory condition 6(7)
    do not address priorities.  To determine priorities in this case, resort
    must be had to s. 9(1) of the PPSA.  Neither s. 4(1)(c) of the PPSA nor statutory
    condition 6(7) of the Insurance Act, alone or in combination, constitute
    an exception to the s. 9(1) PPSA general priorities rule.  On the facts of
    this case, GE’s PMSIs in the Trucks are effective as against ING under s.
    9(1).</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(ii)   Under s. 4(1)(c), ING was relieved of the
    obligation to provide notice of its interests under the ING policies in the
    PPSA registry.  However, while s. 4(1)(c) freed ING from the need to protect
    its own interests under the PPSA, it did not relieve it of the requirement
    to be mindful of the PPSA-protected interests of other parties in the same
    collateral.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(iii) The reach of ING’s salvage rights under statutory
    condition 6(7) is determined by
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Brampton’s salvage rights as they existed before ING triggered statutory
    condition 6(7).

    Brampton’s salvage rights in the Trucks did not extinguish or displace the

    “continue as to the collateral” within the meaning of s. 25(1)(a) because
    GE
    “expressly or impliedly authorized” Brampton to deal with the collateral:
    (i) by permitting Brampton to deal with insurance-related matters concerning

    contained an explicit title reservation clause in favour of GE.  Unless and

  <h2>(4)       Concluding Observations</h2>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    end with these observations.  This case involves the balancing of the competing
    interests in collateral of two ‘innocent’ parties.  GE took all necessary
    steps to perfect its PMSIs under the PPSA.  It had no knowledge that the
    Trucks had been stolen until its own inquiries led to discovery of the thefts.  Nor
    did it know of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Brampton’s misrepresentations to ING.  ING had no involvement in the thefts
    or
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Brampton’s misrepresentations, and it did not know of GE’s security interests
    in the Trucks until after it had paid the proceeds under the ING policies.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the other hand, measures were available to both parties that might have avoided
    this dispute.  GE did not require that
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Brampton cause its third party lessees to name GE as an insured, a loss payee
    or a beneficiary under any third party insurance policy obtained on the Trucks.  Nor
    did GE require
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Brampton to provide it with copies of any third party insurance policies.  These
    options were available to GE.  However, their success was dependent on the
    reliability of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Brampton and its lessees.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    its part, ING did not conduct any PPSA searches in this case.  It defends
    this omission by pointing to what it describes as standard insurance industry
    practice: in reliance on s. 4(1)(c) of the PPSA, no PPSA searches are performed
    by insurers or insurance brokers prior to the issuance of automobile insurance
    policies.  But, as I have said, the effect of s. 4(1)(c) of the PPSA is to
    relieve an insurer from the necessity of protecting its own interests in
    respect of an insurance policy by providing notice of those interests in
    the PPSA registry.  Section 4(1)(c) does not insulate insurers from the PPSA-protected
    claims of third party secured creditors.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>And
    the means of ascertaining the existence of GE’s PMSIs in the Trucks were
    readily available to ING by the simple device of conducting a PPSA search
    before issuing the ING policies, before paying the ING insurance proceeds,
    before requesting and receiving the Transfer from
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Brampton and, in the case of the 2005 Truck, before disposing of the insured
    collateral.  Notice of GE’s security interests was also provided in the used
    vehicle information packages available from the Ministry of Transportation.  ING
    did not avail itself of any of these opportunities to determine if its interests
    would be subject to the protected priority position of another claimant.  Unlike
    the preventative options available to GE, which I have described above, the
    measures available to ING to protect its interests were not dependent on
    the reliability of its insured or a third party.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    note also that the potential existence of secured creditors with claims regarding
    the insured collateral was within ING’s contemplation.  The ING policies
    provided for the identification of lienholders and the protection of their
    interests on payment of the ING insurance proceeds.  This record is silent
    as to what steps ING took, if any, to determine if secured claims existed
    in respect of the Trucks prior to settling
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Brampton’s claim for indemnification under the ING policies.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    these circumstances, I view it as unreasonable that a creditor in GE’s position
    should lose its priority in secured collateral because it failed to foresee
    that its debtor would actively mislead its involved insurers.  To hold otherwise
    would impose a protec-tionist obligation on GE and similarly situated secured
    lenders that could undermine normal good faith collateral financings.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[85]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    therefore conclude that, as between GE and ING, the consequences of Bramp-ton’s
    misrepresentations must be borne by ING.  It is ING, therefore, who must
    look to
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Brampton for satisfaction.  This result is consistent with the proposition,
    which I endorse, that an insured or its named loss payee who has derived
    the benefit of an insurance policy, must make good to the insurer any loss
    occasioned to it by the insured’s or the loss payee’s lack of good faith
    or honesty.  </p>

    would allow the appeal, set aside the order of the application judge, and
    declare that: (i) GE’s PMSIs in the Trucks and their proceeds have priority
    over ING’s salvage rights in the same vehicles; and (ii) GE is entitled to
    possession of the 2003 Truck and to the proceeds from the sale of the 2005
    Truck.  I would award GE its costs of this appeal on the partial indemnity
    scale, fixed in the amount of $17,000, inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.,
    and its costs of the proceeding before the application judge, fixed – as
    agreed by the parties – in the total amount of $15,000, inclusive of disbursements
