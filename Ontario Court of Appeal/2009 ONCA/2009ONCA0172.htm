line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant appeals his conviction for first degree murder.  While the central
    issue at trial was identity, in our view, the evidence that the appellant
    killed the deceased was overwhelming.  Accordingly, we will principally deal
    with those grounds of appeal concerning the appellant’s liability for first
    degree murder and the mental state for second degree murder.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Unlawful
      confinement</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge erred in leaving liability for first
    degree murder on the basis of unlawful confinement.  In our view, there was
    a sufficient basis for a finding of unlawful confinement.  There was evidence
    of a dispute between the deceased and the appellant in the Stevens apartment
    involving unwanted sexual advances and a physical assault.  From this evidence
    the jury could conclude that the deceased would not have willingly accompanied
    the appellant.  This together with the trail of blood from the apartment
    to the stairwell, where the deceased was killed, would support a finding
    that the deceased was forced to accompany the appellant to the stairwell
    where she was savagely attacked.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Failure
      to relate the facts to the law</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    ground of appeal primarily turns on attempted sexual assault as an alternative
    basis for first degree murder.  The appellant submits that the trial judge
    failed to identify for the jury the key factual findings that had to be made
    in order to ground liability on the basis of attempted sexual assault.  In
    particular, the appellant submits that realistically the jury could only
    find that the appellant killed the deceased in the course of an attempted
    sexual assault if they found that the appellant had earlier sexually touched
    the deceased in the apartment.  The appellant submits that given the violence
    of the attack in the stairwell, the fact that the deceased’s pants’ button
    and zipper were undone was ambiguous and would only support a finding of
    attempted sexual assault in the context of the earlier alleged touching.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the charge to the jury sufficiently related the facts to the legal
    issues.  Given the position taken by Crown counsel in his jury address and
    the manner in which the charge to the jury was structured, it would have
    been obvious to the jury that proof of the sexual touching in the apartment
    was a crucial part of the Crown’s case.  </p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Drunkenness</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the judicial pre-trial, counsel who then represented the appellant made it
    clear that the defence of drunkenness would not be advanced.  Consistent
    with this position, defence counsel asked few questions about the appellant’s
    apparent state of sobriety during the trial.  Similarly, Crown counsel did
    not lead any evidence from people who interacted with the appellant throughout
    the day and might have shed light on the appellant’s state of sobriety.  The
    only evidence of drunkenness came from the other occupants of the apartment
    who described a day of drinking and going to the beer store for more beer
    and in the appellant’s statement in which he said he drank twelve beers and
    his memory of events was blurry.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge directed the jury that in deciding whether the appellant had
    the requisite mental state for murder, they should consider the evidence
    of his alcohol consumption and she specifically directed the jury to the
    appellant’s statement to the police.  She instructed the jury that if they
    had a reasonable doubt that the appellant had the requisite intent, he could
    only be convicted of manslaughter.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for the appellant now submits that the trial judge did not sufficiently direct
    the jury with respect to the defence of drunkenness.  Given the positions
    taken by the parties at the judicial pre-trial and indeed throughout the
    trial, the trial judge’s directions were correct.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Adequacy
      of the <i>Vetrovec </i>warning</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Three
    witnesses, Stevens, Whitefish and Thiele played a central role in proof of
    the sexual assault underpinning liability for first degree murder.  All three
    were drinking heavily during the relevant time and their memories were suspect.  They
    made inconsistent statements prior to trial and during the trial and Stevens
    in particular was inconsistent throughout his testimony.  It was also apparent
    that some of the witnesses were having difficulty distinguishing between
    what they observed and what they were told by others.  In the circumstances,
    the trial judge quite properly gave the jury a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning in
    relation to these three witnesses.  That warning was focused on the problem
    arising from the witnesses’
    numerous inconsistent statements.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the <i>Vetrovec</i> warning was inadequate in two
    respects.  First, the trial judge erred in failing to alert the jury to the
    reasons for the need for caution beyond that fact that they had made prior
    inconsistent statements.  Second, the trial judge erred in directing jury
    that the evidence of one <i>Vetrovec </i>witness was capable of confirming
    the evidence of another of these suspect witnesses.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s first submission centres on the theory that the real problem
    with the <i>Vetrovec</i> witnesses was that they had only “recovered” memories
    and this problem should have been placed clearly before the jury.  Recovered
    memories was never mentioned at the trial and, in our view, it was not necessary
    for the trial judge to frame the issues in those terms.  The frailties in
    the testimony of the three suspect witnesses were apparent on the record.  It
    was obvious that these witnesses had difficulty with their recollections,
    that their recollections may have been affected by what they heard from others
    and that it was only with the assistance of various aids, such as the video
    surveillance recordings, that they could provide some of their evidence.  All
    of these problems were manifest in their many inconsistent versions of the
    events and it was this aspect of their testimony that the trial judge expressly
    included in her <i>Vetrovec</i> warning.  In the balance of the extensive
    review of the evidence, the trial judge identified the various factors that
    explained the inconsistencies.  Identifying the problem as one of recovered
    memory would not have assisted the jury in deciding what parts of the evidence
    of these witnesses they could safely rely upon.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    also do not accept that the trial judge erred in instructing the jury that
    the evidence of one suspect witness could confirm the evidence of another
    witness.  This court has held to the contrary in <i>R. v. Winmill</i> (1999),
    131 C.C.C. (3d) 380 at para. 115. Also see <i>R. v. Khela</i>, 2009 SCC 4
    at para. 39.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the three witnesses shared some of the same characteristics that made their
    evidence suspect, such as prior inconsistent statements, in our view it was
    open to the jury to look to confirmation of one <i>Vetrovec</i> witness in
    the evidence of another <i>Vetrovec</i> witness. This is not a case where
    the witnesses had colluded; in fact, counsel conceded they were probably
    not capable of colluding.  </p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Re-examination
      and use of prior consistent statements</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge erred in permitting Crown counsel
    to re-examine Stevens and Whitefish.  These two witnesses were extensively
    cross-examined on their prior statements.  In the case of Stevens, the focus
    of the cross-examination was on his preliminary inquiry testimony.  Based
    on the preliminary inquiry testimony, it was the theory of the defence that
    Stevens had not actually witnessed the appellant touching the complainant.  It
    was open to the trial judge to permit Crown counsel to re-examine the witness
    to demonstrate that he had testified at the preliminary inquiry that he had
    witnessed the touching.  Further, given the multiple versions of events that
    Stevens had given, it was then open to Crown counsel to attempt to have the
    witness clarify which version was the correct one.  Once Stevens adopted
    in re-examination his preliminary inquiry testimony it was available for
    the truth of its contents.  The rule concerning the limited use of prior
    consistent statements had no application.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to Whitefish, the attack on his evidence centred on his statement
    to the police.  It was open to the trial judge to permit Crown counsel to
    re-examine Whitefish on other parts of his statement to the police.  Otherwise,
    the jury would have been left with a misleading impression as to what the
    witness had told the police.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Post-offence
      conduct</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge left to the jury three pieces of evidence concerning the appellant’s
    conduct after the offence.  The appellant submits that the trial judge erred
    in failing to instruct the jury that this evidence could only assist to prove
    that the appellant was the killer and not the level of culpability.  In particular,
    it is argued that the evidence could not be used to show whether the killing
    was committed in the course of sexual assault.  In our view, it would have
    been apparent to the jury that the evidence had the limited use.  This was
    the position clearly taken by Crown counsel as reviewed in the charge to
    the jury.  The comments of Major J. in <i>R. v. Jacquard</i> (1997), 113
    C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.) at paras. 55-61 are directly applicable to this case.  Finally,
    we are satisfied that the trial judge’s instructions concerning alternative
    innocent explanations were sufficient.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Failure
      to grant a mistrial</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the course of his testimony, Whitefish blurted out that the appellant “went
    to prison for something he did to a girl named Tracy Carpenter”.  Defence
    counsel sought a mistrial.  The trial judge in careful reasons refused the
    mistrial.  The witness had been speaking in a very low voice and the trial
    judge was satisfied that it was doubtful the jury was able to fully make
    out the comment.  Whether or not to grant a mistrial in those circumstances
    is pre-eminently a matter for the trial judge and her decision on such an
    issue is entitled to considerable deference.  We have not been persuaded
    that the trial judge’s decision was unreasonable.  We agree with the trial
    judge that in the circumstances no limiting instruction was required; to
    the contrary such an instruction would merely have drawn attention to the
    comment.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Limiting

line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge should have provided a limiting instruction
    to the jury as to the use to be made of admissions the appellant made about
    being involved in fights on the street.  We do not agree.  Any such instruction
    would have undermined the defence position that the appellant had a propensity
    to be involved in such scuffles, which explained the scratches on his face.</p>

    police officer testified that when he entered the room and announced he was
    from the homicide squad, the appellant unlike the others in the room did
    not turn around.  It was the theory of the Crown that the appellant did not
    turn around because he was attempting to hide the scratches to his face.  This
    was a permissible inference on the record.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also submits that the trial judge erred in directing the jury that
