    10:45 p.m. on July 15, 2006, Francis Pitia and a friend were walking through
    Victoria Park, in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Kitchener, and were approaching Salah Dawoud, another friend of theirs.  Pitia

    , who came to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    as a refugee in 2003.  As a result of polio, he walks with crutches.  Mr.
    Dawoud is also a black Sudanese male, who came to

    Mr. Pitia and his friend were approaching Mr. Dawoud, they were attacked
    by a group of approximately seven men and three women.  One of the men was
    the appellant.  The appellant yelled “Nigger nigger you’ve got to die.”  Pitia’s
    crutches were taken from him and he was knocked to the ground, where he was
    punched and kicked by the assailants.  The assailants also used Pitia’s crutches
    as a weapon in their attack on him.  Dawoud was also attacked, though to
    a lesser extent.  </p>

    appellant, age 22 at the time, was apprehended by police that night, and
    was found to have been drinking.  He was arrested two days later, on July
    17, 2006.  He denied that the attack was racially motivated.  He told the
    court that he was ashamed of what he had done, and that it was the result
    of his stupidity coupled with the effects of intoxication. </p>

      individuals were charged in relation to the attack on Mr. Pitia.  Two of

      and twelve months respectively. </span></p>

      Noseworthy pled guilty to the lesser offence of assault simpliciter.  He
      was sentenced to a further five months imprisonment after receiving credit
      for dead time of five months on a two for one basis, resulting in a credit
      of 10 months.  In addition, he received 18 months probation.  Mr. Paquin
      pled guilty to assault causing bodily harm and was sentenced, on a joint
      submission, to 12 months imprisonment and 12 months probation.</span></p>

      appellant submits that the assault on Mr. Pitia was a joint enterprise
      and that Mr. Noseworthy has a criminal record similar to that of the appellant,
      in that he has 26 convictions including five convictions for assault.  Mr.
      Noseworthy’s involvement, for which he pled guilty to simple assault, consisted
      in stopping Mr. Dawoud from coming to the aid of Mr. Pitia by punching
      him. </span></p>

      however, Mr. Noseworthy was credited with breaking up the assault on Mr.
      Pitia and saving Mr. Pitia’s life.  Mr. Pitia was on the ground, unconscious
      and bleeding, when Mr. Noseworthy stopped the attack by taking the crutch
      away from the person who was using it to beat him and suggesting that the
      group leave.  The crown did not allege that he used or condoned racist
      language.  The sentencing judge accepted that Mr. Noseworthy’s remorse
      was genuine and sincere.  </span></p>

      Paquin, who joined in the assault after it had begun, had a far less serious
      record than the appellant and was the father of three young children.  Although
      he pled guilty to assault causing bodily harm, he was unaware that there
      were racial slurs and was not held responsible for the racial overtones
      of the offence.   </span></p>

      appellant was the first one to attack Mr. Pitia.  The appellant was the
      only one shouting racial slurs.  The sentencing judge did not accept his
      expression of remorse.  Hence, in his case, specific deference took on
      added significance.  Moreover, with some 43 convictions, many of which
      involved violence, the appellant had the most extensive criminal record.  </span></p>

      turn now to the issue of pretrial custody.  The appellant was in custody
      for 11 months prior to trial.  </span>Pre-trials were held on August 16,
      2006; September 11, 2006 and November 29, 2006.  At each pre-trial, the
      Crown discussed the possibility of a guilty plea to assault causing bodily
      harm with the understanding that two other charges, assaulting Mr. Pitia
      with his crutch and robbery of the crutch, would be withdrawn.  As the
      investigation progressed, it became clear that the appellant was not the
      person who had used Mr. Pitia’s crutch as a weapon to beat him and that
      he had not taken it.  A date for trial was set on December 18, 2006.  Five
      months later, on the eve of trial, the appellant pled guilty.<span lang=EN-US>  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      sentencing the appellant, the trial judge gave him credit for 16 months
      of incarceration.  For the five months prior to the setting of the trial
      date, the appellant received credit for time served on a two for one basis.  For
      the six months between the setting of the trial date and the imposition
      of the sentence the trial judge only granted credit on a one for one basis
      because, in the trial judge’s view, the appellant could and should have
      pled guilty on the day that the trial date was set, and because the appellant
      did not suffer any prejudice due to the unavailability of rehabilitative
      programs in the institution that he was incarcerated in during this time. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There
      was no finding by the trial judge that the appellant purposefully delayed
      the sentencing proceeding in order to effectively dictate the length of
      the sentence.  Indeed as the trial judge pointed out in his reasons, the
      Crown did not allege malfeasance on the part of the appellant.  In those
      circumstances we agree with the appellant that the principle of malfeasance
      enunciated in <i>R. v. Thornton </i>(2007), 224 O.A.C. 219 (
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), did not apply.  However, another consideration often taken into account
    in granting two for one credit for pre-trial custody is the absence of programs
    for rehabilitation.  Having regard to the appellant’s history, the trial
    judge did not think it likely that he would have availed himself of such
    programs.  The trial judge was entitled to take this into account although
    the Crown led no specific evidence to that effect.  Mr. Bradley’s 43 convictions
    speak for themselves.  </span></p>

      violence in a public place against two strangers.  The physical injuries
      to the victim, Mr. Pitia, were very serious and the psychological damage
      to him is severe and continuing.
     In all the circumstances, even if the appellant should have received slightly
    more credit for pre-trial custody, the sentence, in our view, was fit. </span></p>
