    appellant was convicted of two counts of welfare fraud.  With respect to
    count one, the appellant was convicted of collecting $69,462.60 in social
    assistance for misrepresenting herself as a single parent while she was living
    in a common law relationship.  With respect to count two, the appellant was
    convicted of collecting a further $25,594 in social assistance without disclosing
    support payments received from her common law spouse following their separation.  The
    sentencing judge imposed a global sentence of five months incarceration and
    a separate restitution order in the amount of $90,127.15.  The appellant
    appeals from her conviction and, if leave be granted, against the restitution
    order imposed.  The appellant has served the custodial portion of her sentence. </p>

    appellant’s primary grounds of appeal are whether the trial judge erred in
    holding that she was a common law spouse and whether the trial judge erred
    in the manner in which he dealt with the evidence.  We would dismiss the
    appeal in relation to count 1.  In relation to count 2 we are of the opinion
    that the trial judge did misapprehend the evidence and accordingly the conviction
    must be set aside and the amount of the restitution order reduced. Our reasons
    follow.</p>

    January 25, 1988, the appellant applied for “sole support” social assistance
    from the Ministry of Community and Social Services (the “Ministry”).  In
    her application, she described Richard as a friend and tenant who paid her
    rent.  The Ministry employee explained that rental income would reduce her
    assistance.  She also explained that she would not be entitled to sole support
    if she had a common law spouse.</p>

    April 27, 1989, the appellant informed the Ministry that Richard had moved
    out on March 30, 1989.  She further advised the Ministry that she had moved
    to

    114 St. Vincent Street in
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    Sarnia, a house owned by Richard.  On April 28, 1989, she signed a statutory
    declaration confirming that she had moved to that address as of April 1,
    1989 and that Richard was now her landlord and she was paying him rent. </p>

    June 12, 1989, the appellant reported a domestic assault to the police.  She
    signed a statement describing Richard as her common-law spouse who had been
    living with her for five years.  The statement was admitted through the officer
    at trial as past recollection recorded.</p>

    June 17, 1990, the appellant completed a cohabitation questionnaire at the
    request of the Ministry.  The appellant again described Richard as her landlord.  She
    indicated that she did not have joint finances or benefits with Richard.  The
    appellant admits that, in fact, she and Richard co-signed two loan agreements,
    one in 1987 and the other in 1989.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

    of the

    <st1:address w:st="on">
    114 Vincent Street house on January 27, 1992.  She also sought support for
    herself and her children.  She also swore affidavits stating that her relationship
    with Richard began in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Calgary in 1984, that they moved to
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Sarnia and had since lived together as common-law spouses.  Richard was ordered
    to make spousal support payments.</p>

    thereafter, they moved into a house at
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    548 Confederation Street.  The appellant voluntarily withdrew from family

    two years later, the parties separated in 1995.  They reconciled again in
    the fall of that year and began living together in April 1996.  They finally
    separated in 1996 after another domestic assault. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    November 29, 1995, the appellant re-applied for social assistance.  She declared
    that she was separated from her husband, that she was not receiving support
    and that he had not made any provision for her or her children.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    August 26, 1996, the appellant petitioned for divorce and applied for interim
    support, including health benefits for her daughter, as well as exclusive
    possession of the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    547 Confederation Street home.  The appellant swore that she and Richard
    had lived together for twelve years prior to their marriage in 1993 and that
    she had assumed the role of housewife.  Richard swore that he did not live
    in a common law relationship with the appellant prior to the marriage.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Richard

    their divorce, Richard was ordered to pay spousal and child support and the
    appellant obtained exclusive possession of the matrimonial home.  Richard
    testified that he made support payments and received a letter from the Family
    Responsibility Office confirming that he had discharged his obligations.  The
    support payments were not deducted from the appellant’s assistance from the
    Ministry.</p>

      relation to the issue of whether confirmatory evidence of the appellant’s
      affidavit in the divorce proceedings was required, a trial judge is entitled
      to accept all, part, or none of the evidence of a witness.  The exhibits
      attached to the appellant’s affidavit provided significant support for
      her statement that she had lived common law with Richard prior to their
      marriage.  The trial judge was entitled to find, based on the affidavit
      evidence alone, that the appellant was a common law spouse. While confirmatory
      evidence existed, the trial judge did not need to refer to it.</span></p>

      would not give effect to the appellant’s submissions in respect of the
      other grounds of appeal outlined above.  The trial judge found that the
      evidence of the appellant’s two exculpatory witnesses, Bird and Archer,
      did not add up and did not leave him with a reasonable doubt.  While the
      reasons may not have been perfect, the trial judge explained why he did
      not believe these witnesses.  Although the trial judge did not refer to
      the evidence of the appellant’s daughter Laura, he was not obliged to do
      so in the circumstances. </span><span style='color:black'>A trial judge
      is not obliged to discuss all of the evidence on any given point, provided
      the reasons show that he or she grappled with the substance of the live
      issues on the trial:  <i>R v. R.E.M.</i>,<i> </i>[2008] 235 C.C.C. (3d)

      case turned largely on the documentary evidence. The fact that the trial
      judge commented on the evidence of many witnesses seriatim does not mean
      that he failed to consider the totality of the evidence or to weigh the
      evidence given by one witness against another’s.</span></p>

      ritualistic incantation of the three-step method of approaching the evidence.  As

      at 132-135, what is critical is whether, on a review of the reasons as
      a whole, the correct burden and standard of proof was applied.  We are
      satisfied that the trial judge did so.

      police officer had no recollection of taking the appellant’s statement.  The
      appellant submits that in order for the statement to be admitted, the witness
      must be able to recollect the giving of the statement and must be able
      to testify that at the time the statement was given, he or she could remember
      the events in question and that the recorded statement was true.  She submits
      these are the requirements for past recollection recorded.  In this case
      the officer had no memory of the statement and could not testify where
      he got the information from.  </span></p>

      our opinion the statement was nevertheless admissible.  The police officer’s
      evidence was admitted for the limited purpose of proving that the statement
      was made.   The police officer was under a duty to record what the appellant
      said to him regarding the domestic assault.  Although the police officer
      could not remember taking this statement, he testified as to his usual
      practice.  The statement appears to fall within the exception in <i>Ares
      v. Venner</i>,<i> </i>[1970] S.C.R. 608 as being a recording within the
      recorder’s normal scope of duty. In any event, the statement was not that
      of the police officer but of the appellant. The appellant signed each page
      of the statement and the purpose of her doing so was to confirm the accuracy
      of what was recorded.  The trial judge did not err in admitting the statement. </span></p>
