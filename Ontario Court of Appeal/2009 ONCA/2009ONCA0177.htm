    of two additional charges, which the Crown does not appeal.  The victims
    are two sisters, R. and M., who are the respondents step-nieces.  The Crown
    submits that the trial judge committed two errors  he rejected the Crowns
    application to use evidence on all counts as similar fact evidence on each

    was acquitted of two additional offences alleged to have been committed against
    R., which the Crown does not appeal. These acquittals on counts ten and eleven
    came about as a result of amendments to the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  It was
    also alleged that the appellant committed eight sexual offences against M.
    when she was between thirteen and seventeen years old.  The eight charges
    arose out of four incidents, in each of which M. was riding with the respondent
    in his truck when he drove to a remote area and sexually assaulted her.</p>

    old. M. testified that while she was in the respondents truck, he drove
    north on the highway away from their reserve, and turned onto a side road
    and parked. The respondent kissed M., felt her breasts, and rubbed himself
    on her. M. was scared and did not know what to do; she got out of the truck
    and lit a cigarette. The respondent got out and threw her cigarette on the
    ground. He put M. up against the truck and rubbed her breasts and vagina.
    She told him that she did not want to do anything. He then undid her jeans,
    put his hand inside her underwear and rubbed the outside of her vagina. She
    told him not to do that, pushed him away, and told him to take her home.</p>

    alleged to have occurred when M. was fifteen or sixteen years old. M. testified
    that she was riding in the respondents truck when he drove to a bush road
    outside their reserve. The respondent kissed her and [felt her] up. She
    told him that it was not right, and tried to get out of the truck. He told
    her that if she did not do anything with him, she would have to walk home,
    and that there were bears in the area. M. was afraid to walk home. The respondent
    continued to feel her breasts and vagina. He then removed one of her shoes
    and one of her pant legs, and had vaginal intercourse with her.</p>

    to have occurred during the same summer in which the second incident was
    alleged to have occurred. M. testified that she was in the respondents truck
    when he drove away from their reserve and stopped on a bush road. The respondent
    told her that he wanted her to give him a blow-job. M. refused. The respondent
    undid his pants, pulled out his penis, and tried to make her touch his penis.
    She balled her hand in a fist. He rubbed her fist on his penis and pubic
    hair. He opened her hand and rubbed it up and down on his penis, and then
    pushed her head toward his penis. M. said no, kept her mouth closed, started
    to gag, and then sat back up. She told him that she did not
    want to put that in [her] mouth. He told her that she would have to do
    something, or else she would have to walk home, after which he had vaginal
    intercourse with her.</p>

    that she was riding with the respondent in his truck when he drove north
    of their reserve and stopped on a side road. He said that he wanted her to
    give him a blow-job; she said that she did not want to, and his response
    was you gotta do somethingits a long way back. M. wanted to jump out
    of the truck, but she was too scared of being in the bush. She told the respondent
    that she was menstruating, and that she did not want to do anything with
    him. He pulled his penis out of his jeans, held her hand around it and rubbed
    her hand up and down on his penis until he ejaculated.</p>

    occurred when R. was fourteen or fifteen years old. She testified that she
    was walking down a trail towards her home when the respondent called out
    to her from a shack, and invited her to listen to music on cassette tapes.
    She agreed and sat down on a chair in the shack. The respondent grabbed her
    from behind and put her onto the bed. She struggled and tried to fight back,
    ripping his shirt. The respondent shoved her down on the bed hard, and hit
    her face or chin. He then pulled off one of her pant legs, leaving the other
    hooked around her ankle, and had vaginal intercourse with her.</p>

    road, and stopped the truck. He pulled his erect penis out of his pants, made
    it go in circles with no hands, and told her to look at it.</p>

    that she continued to ride in the respondents truck because she wanted to
    be liked and accepted by her step-fathers family, and because she was optimistic
    that maybe this time it would be nice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown invited the trial judge to apply the evidence adduced on all counts,
    including counts ten and eleven, in reaching a conclusion on each individual
    count.  In refusing to do so, the trial judge stated at paras. 2-4:</p>
   <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>When character evidence is called, which shows
    only that the accused is the type of person to have committed a crime, this
    is inadmissible.  The rule that allows such evidence to be admitted in certain
    circumstances, for other purposes, is called [the] similar fact evidence
    rule and was set out in the case of [<i>R. v.</i> <i>Handy</i>, [2002] 2
    S.C.R. 908] in the Supreme Court of Canada, at [para.] 55 as follows:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>Similar fact evidence is thus presumptively
    inadmissible.  The onus is on the prosecution to satisfy the trial judge
    on a balance of probabilities that in the context of the particular case
    the probative value of the evidence in relation to a particular issue outweighs
    its potential prejudice and thereby justifies its reception.</p>
   <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Consequently, the first thing to determine in assessing
    admissibility of similar fact evidence is the purpose for which it is being
    admitted.  As was set out in the <i>Handy</i> case, at [paras.] 115 and 116:</p>
   <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The Crown says the issue generally is
    the credibility of the complainant and more specifically that the accused
    has a strong disposition to do the very act alleged in the charges against
    him, but this requires some refinement.  Care must be taken not to allow
    too broad a gateway for the admission of propensity evidence or, as it is
    sometimes put, to allow it to bear too much of the burden of the Crowns
    case (Sopinka, Lederman and Bryantat para. 11.26. Credibility is an issue
    that pervades most trials, and at its broadest may amount to a decision on
    guilt or innocence.  </p>
   <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Anything that blackens the character of an accused
    may, as a by-product, enhance the credibility of a complainant.  Identification
    of credibility as the issue in question may, unless circumscribed, risk
    the admission of evidence of nothing more than a general disposition (bad
    personhood).</p>
   <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Now I can only assume from the Crowns argument
    that its purpose in wanting to admit the similar fact evidence is to attack
    the credibility of the accused, who has flatly denied any improper involvement
    with the complainants.  Such a lack of specificity is surely what <i>Handy</i> speaks
    out against.  In this case, credibility is not just one of the issues, it
    is the issue.  So for this reason alone, the similar fact evidence proposed
    should not be admitted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge referred to the formula in <i>Handy</i> and concluded at paras.
    6-10:</p>
   <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Now regarding the evidence of [R.] being used in
    the counts relating to [M.], the evidence relating to count nine is very
    weak.  It does not stand up in the face of the defence evidence, as to the
    use of the building, where the alleged rape was alleged to have taken place
    and as to the activity that was going on there at the time of [G.B.]s funeral.  This
    then weakens the evidence of the other similar evidence related by [R.], <i>i.e.</i>,
    anal intercourse and gross indecency.  Furthermore, the alleged acts take
    place over a lengthy period of time and were not similar in detail to the
    allegations relating to [M.]</p>
   <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Now regarding [M.]s evidence being used as similar
    fact evidence on count nine, which relates to [R.], this also has a very
    weak probative value.  [M.] is quite clear in all of her evidence that all
    of the sexual assaults took place in the accuseds red G.M.C. truck.  The
    evidence however, is quite clear that the accused did not own nor drive a
    red G.M.C. truck until February of 1985, well after the times alleged in
    counts one and two.</p>
   <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>So again, this not only leaves count one and two
    in doubt, but weakens the allegations of [M.] with respect to the similar
    fact evidence asked to be admitted.  Further, the events are not proximate
    in time, spanning a seven-year period and were not similar in detail to the
    acts alleged by [R.]</p>
   <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Finally, for the same reasons as set out above,
    the probative value of [M.]s allegations are sufficiently weak as to be
    inadmissible as similar fact evidence to support each other.</p>
   <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>When one compares the probative value of the evidence,
    set out above, to the possible prejudice to the accused, in other words,
    that prejudice being that the accused runs the risk of being convicted because
    of his bad character, rather than because of proof that he committed the
    offences, the application to admit similar fact evidence by the Crown must
    fail.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge reviewed the evidence of the complainants with respect to the
    commission of the offences.  R. testified that she was sexually assaulted
    on a bed in a shack behind her grandfathers house that was commonly referred
    to by means of a distinctive name.  The respondent testified that there was
    no furniture in that particular shack.  M.s evidence was that she was sexually
    assaulted in the respondents red truck.  The respondent testified that he
    did not own a red truck during the period when the first incident was alleged
    to have occurred.  The trial judge then made reference to the three-part
    rule in <i>R. v. W. (D.)</i>, [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742 (S.C.C.), and applied it
    in respect of the charge involving R. at para. 15:</p>
   <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Applying this rule and considering the evidence
    presented by the defence, I have no reason not to believe the accused and
    so I find him not guilty on this count.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    reviewing the evidence concerning counts five to eight alleging sexual assaults
    to M., the trial judge stated at paras. 23 and 24:</p>
   <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Now these counts arose out of events around three
    incidents, each allegedly similar in nature, in which the complainant, [M.],
    says that she got into the accuseds red truck and then he drove to a bush
    road near [their community] where she was assaulted.  The accused totally
    denies these allegations.</p>
   <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In a situation such as this, where there is a straight
    accusation on one side and a denial on the other, <i>and no evidence to support
    either side</i> and even if one were inclined to disbelieve the accused,
    on the basis of the Crown and <i>W.D.</i>, he would have to be acquitted,
    since proof beyond a reasonable doubt requires more than this to convict.  [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Next,
    the trial judge considered counts one and two, alleging the sexual assault
    of M., in paras. 16 to 19.  Like the other assaults to M., she testified
    that they occurred when the respondent took her for a ride in his red truck,
    drove to a remote area and sexually assaulted her.  The respondent testified
    that he owned a blue truck at this time.  The trial judge concluded at para.
    19:</p>
   <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>So once again, based on the evidence of the accused,
    supported by the evidence noted above and applying the rule in the Crown
    and <i>W.D</i>, I find the Crown has not proved guilt beyond a reasonable
    doubt and the accused must be acquitted on counts one and two.</p>

    dismissing the Crowns application to permit evidence regarding each count
    to be used as similar fact evidence regarding all other counts.  In particular,
    the Crown submitted:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>(a) in finding that the Crown sought admission of the evidence to attack
    the credibility of the accused and that for this reason alone the application
    should be dismissed, the trial judge misapprehended both the Crowns position
    and the legitimate use that could be made of the evidence; and </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>(b) the trial judge erred in finding that the application must fail because
    the probative value of the similar fact evidence was outweighed by the risk
    of moral prejudice in this non-jury trial.</p>
  <h4 align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>IV</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown submits that in requiring corroboration of M.s testimony before he
    could convict, the trial judge erred in law.  The impugned passage in the
    trial judges reasons is set out in para. 15.  It would appear that in requiring evidence
    to support the complainants testimony, the trial judge concluded that he
    was legally required to acquit the respondent because of lack of corroboration
    of the complainants evidence.  Section 274 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>,
    which came into force more than twenty years ago, provides that where an
    accused is charged with sexual assault, no corroboration of the complainants
    testimony is required for a conviction.  Section 274 has retrospective application
    to counts three, four &amp; seven.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is not entirely clear what the trial judge meant.  If what he meant was that
    there can never be a conviction absent confirmation of the complainants
    testimony in a case of sexual assault where the only witnesses are the complainant
    and the accused, he was wrong.  Given my view of the other ground of appeal,
    it is unnecessary to decide this ground.</p>
  <h4 align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>V</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    will now deal with the second ground of appeal involving the trial judges
    rejection of the similar fact evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge said that the Crowns purpose in seeking to admit the similar
    fact evidence was to attack the respondents credibility.  This was a misapprehension
    of the Crowns position.  In argument before the trial judge, the Crown referred
    to the need to establish a specific line of permissible reasoning, as well
    as to this courts decision in <i>R. v. L.T.</i> (2005), 196 O.A.C. 394,
    concerning the use of similar fact evidence in cases of sexual offences against
    young people.  The Crowns position, therefore, was that the central issue
    on which the similar fact evidence bore was the <i>actus
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    reus</i> of the offences and whether the respondents blanket denial of the
    commission of all eleven offences on which he was tried was credible.  The
    Crown submitted at trial, and in this court, that the evidence ought to have
    been admitted because the compelling degree of similarity among the acts
    overcame the objective improbability of coincidence.  In this respect, the
    Crown urged that the probative value of the evidence outweighed any prejudicial
    effect.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the trial judge misapprehended the Crowns purpose in seeking to
    admit the similar fact evidence.  Its purpose was not merely to attack the
    respondents credibility.  The predominant purpose was to show a pattern
    of similar behaviour that confirmed each complainants testimony.  Put simply,
    in the absence of collusion or some other form of tainting, none of which
    was found in this case, given the similarities in the evidence of R. and
    M. regarding the respondents conduct, it was unlikely that the conduct was
    the result of coincidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crowns position regarding the permissible use of similar fact evidence to
    support a complainants allegations is consistent with decisions of this
    court.  For example, in <i>R. v. Thomas</i> (2004), 72 O.R. (3d) 401, Rosenberg
    J.A. at para. 43 observed that the trial judge did identify the permitted
    use of the evidence.  He suggested that the jury might find that there was
    a pattern of similar behaviour that confirmed each complainants testimony
    that the offences took place.  This was sufficient.  At para. 54 Rosenberg
    J.A. provided the following guidance on the proper use of the evidence:</p>
   <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>If the jury finds this distinctive pattern, they
    might find it defies coincidence that students were lying or mistaken about
    what happened to them absent collusion or some other explanation such as
    tainting through the police investigation.  The evidence accepted by the
    jury might therefore assist the jury in determining whether any of the complainants
    was credible and whether the acts they alleged really occurred. They can
    use the evidence of one or more complainants in assessing the truthfulness
    of the other complainants only if there is this distinctive pattern of conduct
    that suggests that they were describing similar events. [Footnotes omitted.]</p>

   <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I do not think that was a risk here.  The trial
    judges ruling showed that he admitted the similar fact evidence not to show
    a general propensity to engage in sexual misconduct but to show the appellants

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'></p>

    both the Crowns purpose and the legitimate use that could be made of the
    evidence.  It also led him to dismiss the application on the erroneous basis

    explained in <i>Handy</i>, prejudice in the similar fact context involves
    two distinct concepts 
    reasoning prejudice and moral prejudice.  One of the reasons the trial
    judge excluded the evidence was on the ground of moral prejudice.  Reasoning
    prejudice includes the danger that the jury might be confused by the multiplicity
    of incidents and/or might put more weight than is logically justified on
    the similar fact evidence, and also raises concerns regarding undue consumption
    of time involved in receiving evidence of allegations unrelated to the charges
    against the accused.  Moral prejudice concerns the risk that the evidence
    might lead to a conviction on nothing more than bad personhood.  In other
    words, the trier of fact may find the accused guilty not because of the probative
    value of the evidence regarding the issue at trial, but rather because the
    evidence establishes that the accused is a bad person deserving of punishment.  Reasoning
    prejudice and moral prejudice raise legitimate concerns in a jury trial,
    but less so in a non-jury trial, as this was.  Nevertheless, the trial judge
    was concerned about moral prejudice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the proposed similar fact evidence in this case was related to all the counts
    in the indictment and the evidence was already before the court, and because
    this was a non-jury trial, reasoning prejudice was not a real issue.  Unlike
    cases such as <i>Handy</i>, this was not a case where the proposed similar
    fact evidence was extrinsic to the charges before the court and required
    extra witnesses to present it.  The only additional time needed as a result
    of the similar fact evidence was the time required to argue the motion to
    admit it.  As trial judges are presumed to know the law and the proper and
    improper uses of evidence, it seems counterintuitive that similar fact evidence
    could be excluded in a non-jury trial based on the trial judges determination
    that the evidence would confuse him or induce him to put more weight on it
    than is logically justified.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In

      said:</p>
   <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The test for the admissibility of evidence of similar
    acts offered to prove identity is the same whether the alleged similar acts
    are extrinsic to the counts in the indictment, or contained in other counts
    of the same indictment: <i>Arp</i> at para. 51.  The same test notwithstanding,
    some of the factors relevant to an assessment of prejudice may have an attenuated
    influence in cases in which the similar acts are restricted to other counts
    in a multi-count indictment.  It may be all the more so where the case is
    tried by judge sitting without a jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Watt
    J.A. added at paras. 68 and 69:</p>
   <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>This case involves the invocation of similar act
    principles across counts in a multi-count indictment.  The evidence relating
    to each count is relevant to and admissible in proof of the allegation contained
    in that count.  Each incident is of equivalent gravity and of minimal inflammatory
    potential.  This is not a case, in other words, in which conduct extrinsic
    to the crimes alleged in the indictment is enlisted as evidence of similar
    acts to prove what is alleged, and lugs with it inflammatory claims of greater
    gravity or moral depravity.</p>
   <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In large measure, the practical realities of a
    trial by judge sitting alone in a case in which the allegedly similar acts
    do not extend beyond the counts of a multi-count indictment reduce significantly,
    if not to the vanishing point, the virus of reasoning prejudice.  The judge
    is less likely than a jury to be distracted by a focus on similar acts.  No
    additional time is required to adduce the evidence of similar acts because
    they are co-extensive with the evidence that is relevant, material and properly
    admissible on the individual counts.  The only additional time required is
    that needed for the argument on admissibility at the end of the trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R.
      v. Cresswell</i>, 2009 ONCA 95, a decision of this court released January
      30, 2009, the appellant was tried on six counts of sexual assault in a
      non-jury trial.  The court rejected the appellants submissions that the
      trial judge erred by ruling that the evidence on each count was admissible
      as similar fact evidence on all the other counts.  Relevant to this appeal
      is what the court said at paras. 9 and 10:</p>
   <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>We note as well that <i>Handy</i> states that admissibility
    is conditioned by the issue to which the evidence is directed.&nbsp; Here,
    the evidence went not to identity, where distinctive features amounting to
    a signature may be required, but rather to the <i>actus
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    reus</i>, where less cogent similarities may render the evidence admissible.</p>
   <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Finally, we observe that this was a judge alone
    trial on a multi-count indictment. There was no severance application and
    it was inevitable that the judge deciding the case would hear all of the
    evidence.&nbsp; While this, of course, does not by itself render the evidence
    admissible across all counts, it significantly reduces the risk of prejudice.
    &nbsp;Moreover, in his reasons, the trial judge properly identified the permitted
    use of similar fact evidence and cautioned himself against prohibited lines
    of reasoning.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless,
    the trial judge in the case at bar dismissed the application to use the evidence
    on all counts as similar fact evidence on the others, in part on the basis
    that its moral prejudice would outweigh its probative value.  He found:</p>
   <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>When one compares the probative value of the evidence,
    set out above, to the possible prejudice to the accused, in other words, <i>that
    prejudice being that the accused runs the risk of being convicted because
    of his bad character</i>, rather than because of proof that he committed
    the offences, the application to admit similar fact evidence by the Crown
    must fail.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>This ruling reflected three
    misapprehensions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    this was a non-jury trial, in which the danger that an accused would be convicted
    solely on the basis of his general bad behaviour was not a significant concern.  Moral
    prejudice is not a significant risk in a judge-alone trial.  Second, dismissal
    of the application to introduce similar fact evidence did nothing to address
    the probability of moral prejudice.  The trial judge had already heard the
    evidence as part of the Crowns case.  Thus, the trial judges knowledge
    of evidence casting the respondent in a poor light was not eliminated by
    its exclusion as similar fact evidence.  The only issue was whether the already
    admitted evidence could be used for another purpose.  Third, to the extent
    that there is a risk of moral prejudice in a judge-alone trial is possible,
    the trial judge failed to appreciate, with respect to counts one to nine,
    that prejudice was much reduced as none of the underlying incidents were
    more reprehensible than the others.  The allegations regarding each count
    that applied to M. were virtually the same, and were quite similar to the
    incidents related by R., especially those that took place in the respondents
    truck.</p>

    summary, in this case of a multiple count indictment, the issue for the trial
    judge was whether the evidence regarding other counts had sufficient probative
    value to support a legitimate chain of reasoning furnishing evidence of any
    individual count.  However, the trial judge never reached this stage in his
    analysis.  This was because he misapprehended both the Crowns position and
    the law regarding the legitimate use of similar fact evidence in a multiple-count
    indictment tried by a judge without a jury.  These errors were compounded
    by the trial judges misapprehension that the moral prejudice of the evidence
    was too great to admit the evidence.  Moreover, had the trial judge admitted
    the similar fact evidence, the trial judge would have had the very thing
    that he felt was missing to support a conviction on all counts  corroboration.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Handy</i>,
    the Supreme Court of Canada developed a principled approach to the admissibility
    of similar fact evidence.  In that case, the Crown tendered as similar fact
    evidence extrinsic evidence of alleged violent sexual behaviour between the
    accused and his ex-wife.  Although the trial judge admitted the evidence,
    this ruling was set aside by the Supreme Court of Canada.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unlike <i>Handy</i>,
    in this case there was no extrinsic evidence tendered as similar fact evidence.  The
    proposed similar fact evidence was already before the court as evidence on
    the counts in the indictment.  There was no likelihood that the evidence
    would take the defence by surprise.  Unlike <i>Handy</i>, there was no extrinsic
    evidence that would capture the attention of the trier of fact to an unwarranted
    degree.  In this non-jury trial, its potential for prejudice, distraction
    and time consumption, was largely absent and its prejudicial effect, if any,
    did not outweigh its probative value.  There was no danger of judging the
    respondents actions on the basis of character.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the evidence of the respondents misconduct is so relevant and cogent
    that its probative value in the search for truth outweighs any potential
    for misuse.  The proposed evidence had common characteristics with acts charged
    in the indictment, and therefore, was admissible as supportive of the evidence
    of the complainants.  It was highly probative in that the similarities make
    it unlikely that the complainants were lying or mistaken about what happened
    to them.  As Binnie J. said in <i>Handy</i> at para. 42:</p>
   <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In <i>any</i> case, the strength of the similar
    fact evidence must be such as to outweigh
    reasoning prejudice and moral prejudice.  The inferences sought to be
    drawn must accord with common sense, intuitive notions of probability and
    the unlikelihood of coincidence.  Although an element of moral prejudice may
    be introduced, it must be concluded by the trial judge on a balance of probabilities
    that the probative value of the sound inferences exceeds any prejudice likely
    to be created. [Emphasis in original.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    the force of similar circumstances in this case refutes coincidence or other
    innocent explanation.  This evidence is sufficiently compelling to safely
    draw the inference of many sexual assaults on the facts charged.  In short,
    toward his step-nieces the respondent was a sexual predator.  Moreover, as
    the complainants and the respondent lived in a small northern
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario community the evidence represents the observed pattern of propensity
    operating in a closely defined and circumscribed context.  I have no doubt
    that its probative value pointing to the respondent as the perpetrator of
    the sexual assaults outweighs its prejudicial effect.  As Binnie J. emphasized
    in <i>Handy</i>, the primary test for the admission of similar fact evidence
    is whether its probative value outweighs its prejudicial effect.</p>
