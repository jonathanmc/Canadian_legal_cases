    appellant appeals his convictions on one count of arson and two counts of
    arson with intent to defraud insurers.  The theory of the Crown was that
    the appellant hired Dave Daye to set the fire and that Daye enlisted the
    assistance of James Morris and Kory Duff.  Daye and Morris initially denied
    to the police any involvement in the fire, but immediately before the preliminary
    inquiry, they entered pleas of guilty and agreed to testify against the appellant.  Both
    had criminal records.  The appellant raises several grounds of appeal in
    relation to the manner in which the trial judge dealt with their evidence.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ISSUES AND ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h3><i><span
style='font-weight:normal'>1.         Morris’s evidence concerning the conversation
        between Daye and the appellant.</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Morris
    is a developmentally challenged individual who had difficulty giving his
    evidence.  He testified that a day or so before the fire, he overheard a
    conversation between the appellant and Daye during which the appellant agreed
    the pay Daye to set the fire.  The appellant submits that Morris was ambiguous
    in his evidence as to whether he actually overheard that conversation or
    whether Morris was recounting hearsay evidence of what Daye later told him
    about that conversation.  The appellant submits that if his evidence was
    based on what Daye told him, it should have been excluded as hearsay.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge erred by failing to make a threshold
    ruling as to the admissibility of this evidence.  Alternatively, the appellant
    submits the trial judge should have given the jury a limiting instruction
    as to the use they could make of Morris’s evidence if they found he simply
    was repeating what Daye had told him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not agree that the trial judge was required to make a threshold ruling.  In
    our view the proper procedure was to follow, by analogy, the direction given
    in <i>R .v. Evans, </i>[1993] 3 S.C.R. 653 at 668:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>If there is some evidence to permit the issue to
    be submitted to the trier of fact, the matter must be considered in two stages.  First,
    a preliminary determination must be made as to whether, on the basis of evidence
    admissible against the accused, the Crown has established on a balance of
    probabilities that the statement is that of the accused.  If this threshold
    is met, the trier of fact should then consider the contents of the statement
    along with other evidence to determine the issue of innocence or guilt.  While
    the contents of the statement may only be considered for the limited purpose
    to which I have referred above in the first stage, in the second stage the
    contents are evidence of the truth of the assertions contained therein.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge did not follow that approach.  However, we are not persuaded
    that the appellant suffered any prejudice thereby.  No objection was taken
    at trial to the admission of Morris’s evidence, nor did the appellant’s counsel
    object to the failure of the trial judge to deal with the hearsay point in
    his charge.  As we read the record there are two reasons which might have
    led defence counsel to take this approach.  First, the clear preponderance
    of Morris’s evidence was to the effect that he had overheard the conversation
    and the issue now raised on appeal quite likely was simply not perceived
    to be a live issue at trial. Moreover, even if Morris could only testify
    that there was a conversation between the appellant and Daye at the house
    a day or so before the fire, that still amounted to powerful evidence against
    the appellant. Second, the appellant was relying on the hearsay evidence
    of another Crown witness, Kory Duff, who testified that Daye had told him
    that he was setting the fire because his family had lost the house and if
    they could not live there no one else could.  Daye denied making that statement.  An
    objection or an insistence on a direction in relation to Morris’s evidence
    would have invited the same treatment for Duff’s evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    the nature of Morris’s evidence, the absence of any objection from defence
    counsel, and the fact that the ruling and direction now sought could have
    undermined the position taken by the defence at trial, we would not give
    effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h3><i><span style='font-weight:normal'>2.         Jury instructions in relation
        to credibility</span></i></h3>
  <p>(a)  <u>Prior convictions</u></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Daye,
    Morris and Duff all had criminal records that included crimes involving dishonesty.  The
    trial judge gave the usual instruction with respect to the use that could
    be made of any witnesses criminal record in relation to credibility but he
    did not specifically state that crimes of dishonesty had a more direct bearing
    on credibility than certain other offences. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the distinction between the crimes of dishonesty and other crimes having
    less bearing upon credibility is often made in relation to the use to be
    made of witness’s criminal record, we do not agree that the trial judge was
    under an obligation to make that distinction in the circumstances of this
    case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    this was not a case, like <i>R. v.  Brown</i>, (1978) 38 CCC (3d) 339 (
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), where it was necessary to caution the jury about placing undue weight
    on a conviction for a crime that had little bearing on credibility. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    no objection was raised to this aspect of the charge. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    Duff, the Crown witness relied on by the defence for an alternate explanation
    for why Daye set the fire also had a record for crime of dishonesty and the
    direction now sought might well not have benefited the defence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    we would not give effect to this ground of appeal</p>
  <p>(b)  <u>Instruction regarding Morris’s and Daye’s guilty pleas</u></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge instructed the jury as follows with respect to the guilty pleas
    entered by Morris and Daye</p>
   <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Now, pleas of guilty here.  As we heard there were
    pleas of guilty by Mr. Morris and by Mr. Daye on the very circumstances that
    are behind the charges against Mr. Peterman.  Their pleas of guilty, Mr.
    Morris’ plea and Mr. Daye’s plea, have absolutely no bearing on whether Mr.
    Peterman is guilty. You must not think that because Mr. Morris and Mr. Daye
    pleaded guilty, Mr. Peterman therefore must be guilty too.  Mr. Morris and
    Mr. Daye may have had any number of reasons for pleading guilty. And they
    may have any number of reasons for testifying in this court and implicating
    Mr. Peterman however, <i>the pleas of guilty of Mr Morris and Mr. Daye are
    something that you may take into consideration as you decide how much or
    how little their testimony you will believe or rely on in deciding this case.
    Okay?  So it relates to what you are going to believe or not believe with
    regard to their evidence</i>. [Emphasis added]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the italicized portion of this direction could have
    misled the jury into thinking that these witnesses were to be given credit
    for their guilty pleas because they had “owned up” to their part of the crime.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    disagree. In our view, when this portion of the charge is read in the context
    of the charge as a whole, the trial judge properly instructed the jury not
    to assume that because Morrison day had pleaded guilty that the appellant
    must also be guilty and that the only bearing the guilty plea had was that
    it amounted to another conviction which, in accordance with the earlier direction,
    might have a bearing on the credibility of Daye and Morris.</p>
  <h3><span style='font-weight:normal;'>(c)  <i><u>Vetrovec</u></i><u> warning</u></span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is conceded by the appellant that the trial judge gave a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning
    in relation to the evidence of Daye, Morris and Duff.  That warning concluded
    his warning as follows:
    “You should view the testimony of Messrs. Morris, Daye and Duff with great
    caution before convicting the accused.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant complains that the warning was inadequate because it failed to
    draw sufficient attention to why the jury should exercise caution in relation
    to the evidence of these witnesses, including</p>
  <p align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>that
    Morris had given contradictory evidence at the preliminary inquiry;</p>
  <p align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>that
    Daye was an admitted liar;</p>
  <p align=left style='text-align:left;
'><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>that
    Daye was an admitted participant in the crime who had only changed his story
    to implicate the appellant the day before the preliminary inquiry after pleading
    guilty and receiving a conditional sentence on a joint submission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the trial judge could have given a more pointed <i>Vetrovec</i> warning,
    particularly in relation to Daye as an accomplice and as a witness who had
    self-interest in testifying against the appellant, we do not accept the submission
    that the warning he gave was inadequate in the circumstances of this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    has been repeatedly held that the crafting of an appropriate caution to the
    particular circumstances of each case is best left to the trial judge and
    that no particular formulation mandatory.  An appellate court must focus
    on the content of the instruction, not its form, and appellate intervention
    is unwarranted absent a failure to give a cautionary instruction where one
    is required or, where an instruction fails to serve its intended purpose:
    see <i>R. v. Khela</i> 2009 SCJ No. 4, at paras. 13, 44- 45</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge reviewed the contradictions in Morris and Daye’s evidence in
    some detail.  He also reviewed the evidence concerning the alleged deal made
    by Daye in order to avoid a long sentence. As the trial judge pointed out,
    there was no direct evidence of any such deal and Daye denied that a deal
    had been made.  On the other hand, the trial judge did set out the facts
    from which the appellant invited the jury to find that Daye had made a deal
    to give evidence against the appellant to avoid a long sentence.  In our
    view, it could not have been lost on the jury that the defence position was
    that Daye made a deal to get a lenient sentence and that his evidence was
    not to be trusted on that account.  We are fortified in coming to this conclusion
    by that fact that the appellant’s trial counsel, who vigorously argued the
    point in his closing address to the jury, made no objection to this aspect
    of the charge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    we would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h3><i><span style='font-weight:normal'>3.         Other grounds</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    other grounds of appeal were asserted in the appellant’s factum, they were
    not pressed in oral argument and we are not persuaded that they have merit.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
