    appellant was convicted of 7 of 11 counts of sexual misconduct.  He appeals
    his convictions on two principle grounds relating to the trial judges instructions
    to the jury:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>The
    jury instructions failed to include any review of the positions of the parties
    and the evidence capable of supporting their positions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge failed to adequately outline factors that the jury could have
    considered relative to the complainants credibility.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    page five of the instructions, the trial judge told the jury that she would
    refer to the evidence to help them remember it and to show them how it relates
    to the issues.  However, two paragraphs later, the trial judge told the jury
    that as it had been a short trial (three days) she was not going to review
    or summarize the evidence.  Thus, she provided the jury with no assistance
    in respect to outlining the evidence on each of the 11 counts, and relating
    the evidence to the positions of the parties.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, because the trial was on a multiple count indictment, the trial
    judge was obliged to tell the jury that they had to consider the evidence
    with respect to each count separately, and that they could not consider all
    of the evidence in respect to each count.  In this regard, she told the jury
    to
    consider all of the evidence in reaching your decision.  The Crown had
    not asked that the evidence be admitted as similar fact evidence on each
    count.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    for the trial judges failure to adequately instruct the jury in respect
    to the complainants credibility, the trial judge stated only that the appellants
    defence was a denial.  However, the appellant took serious issue with the
    complainants credibility based upon his admission in cross-examination that
    he had used marijuana following his denial of using it in chief and considerable
    discreditable conduct on his part while living with the appellant which he
    said provided a motive by the complainant to fabricate his evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    in her general charge about determining a witness credibility the trial
    judge referred to the inconsistency in the complainants testimony, she made
    no reference to the other factors that were capable of undermining his credibility.  Although
    she said that the jury could consider other factors, she did not identify
    them.  This seriously undermined the appellants defence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would, therefore, give effect to both grounds of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    instructions to the jury need not follow a particular formula and must be
    looked at as a whole, the instructions must fulfill the purposes for which
    they are given.  In <i>R. v. MacKinnon</i> (1999), 132 C.C.C. (3d) 545 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), at para. 27, Doherty J.A. said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>By the end of the instructions, whatever approach

      v. Daley</i>, [2007] S.C.R. 53 at para. 29, on behalf of the majority,
      Bastarache J. expanded upon the purposes of a jury charge as follows in

    paras. 117 to 125, he traced the history of the rule that has stood in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    since 1904 and that was clearly stated in <i>Azoulay v. The Queen</i>, [1952]
    2 S.C.R. 495, at pp. 497-98:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The rule which has been laid down, and consistently
    followed is that in a jury trial the presiding judge must, except in rare
    cases where it would be needless to do so, review the substantial parts of
    the evidence, and give the jury the theory of the defence, so that they may
    appreciate the value and effect of that evidence, and how the law is to be
    applied to the facts as they find them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is not one of those rare cases in which it was unnecessary to outline the
    positions of the parties and the evidence supporting those positions.  To
    judges and lawyers, a three day trial may be considered a short trial, but
    I do not feel that the same can be said of a lay juror.  As well, because
    there were eleven counts, at the very least it was important to review the
    evidence separately with respect to each count and to instruct the jury to
    consider it only in that respect.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
    on the foregoing, unfortunately the charge failed to give the jury any understanding
    of the evidence relevant to the issues to be decided on each count or relevant
    to the defence.  Thus, the charge provided the jury with inadequate assistance
    as to the facts concerning each of the counts and the defence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would therefore allow the appeal, set aside the convictions and order a new
    trial on the seven counts on which the appellant was convicted.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    a three-day jury trial, the appellant was convicted of four counts of sexual
    assault and three counts of sexual exploitation with respect to sexual acts
    perpetrated upon his nephew on numerous occasions between 1992 and 1996.  Two
    counts were specific to 1992, two were specific to 1993, two were specific
    to 1994, and the remaining count was specific to 1996.  The appellant was
    sentenced to a term of imprisonment of five years.  The sentence was concurrent
    on all convictions. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    my colleague, Borins J.A. reaches the same result that I do, I believe respectfully
    that the trial judges error was a more focused one than my colleague suggests.  In
    my view, given the manner in which the Crown chose to conduct the prosecution
    of the appellant, the trial judges error was her failure to review with
    the jury the parties positions with respect to evidence that was relevant
    to each count and to instruct the jury to treat each count as distinct from
    the others.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge declined to review and summarize the evidence because the trial
    had been short, the evidence remained fresh in the jurys minds and counsel
    had made their closing arguments to the jury immediately before the trial
    judges jury charge.  While this approach may be satisfactory in some trials,
    it was unsatisfactory in this one.  Counsels closing arguments did not include
    a review of the evidence as it applied to the discrete counts and appeared
    to focus almost exclusively on witness credibility.  In these circumstances,
    this case was not one of those rare cases in which the trial judge did not
    need to review the evidence and relate that evidence to the defence and Crown
    positions at trial: <i>R. v. Garon</i>, [2009] O.J. No. 24 (C.A.); <i>Azoulay
    v. The Queen</i> [1952] 2 S.C.R. 495; <i>R. v. MacKinnon</i> (1999), 132
    C.C.C. (3d) 545 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">

    ).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the contrary, the jury had to be clearly instructed in respect of the evidence
    and the theories of the crown and the defence concerning each of the separate
    offences charged against the appellant.  This is especially true where, as
    here, the trial judge does not appear to have instructed the jury that each
    count must be decided independent of other counts and where the closing arguments
    of the two parties appeared to characterize the case as being a credibility
    contest.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judges failure to provide such an instruction to the jury could have
    moved the jury to error. The jury may have decided that if the appellant
    committed the offences alleged in 1992, he must have committed the others.
    Inadvertently the jury may have used the evidence with respect to one count
    as evidence of discreditable conduct or propensity evidence with respect
    to other counts. Further the jury may have decided the case on the basis
    of finding the complainant to be credible and the appellant to be less credible
    or incredible.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown acknowledges that this is not an appropriate case for the application
    of the curative proviso.  I agree.  Accordingly, I would allow the appeal,
    set aside the convictions and order a new trial on the counts on which the
    appellant was convicted.</p>
