  <br clear=all style='page-break-before:always'>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent leased premises to carry on business as a delicatessen in a market
    owned by the appellant. The appellant served notice under the demolition
    clause in the lease. The respondent refused the terms offered by the appellant
    and recovered damages for breach of a demolition clause. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    demolition clause required the appellant to offer the respondent “space of
    comparable size and quality to include a storefront operation visible from
    the street” on the same terms as offered to the majority of other tenants
    in the rebuilt market.  It is common ground that the space the appellant
    offered the respondent was smaller and did not include a storefront operation
    visible from the street.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'><i>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></i><i>Causation</i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge erred in finding that the appellant’s
    breach of the demolition clause (admitted for the purpose of this argument)
    was the cause of the respondent’s decision to close their business.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    was a finding of fact and appellate deference is owed.  While the trial judge
    appears to have erred in characterizing the appellant’s business as a restaurant,
    that error in our view, did not impact on the result and therefore, was not “overriding”.
    There was evidence that the space the appellant offered to the respondent
    in the new market did not meet the respondent’s needs as a delicatessen.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge erred in finding that, if the appellant
    had been offered the space to which it was entitled, the appellant would
    not have agreed to pay the going rate for the rent in the new market.  It
    is clear from the record that the appellant was concerned about the increase
    in rent, but that concern did not stand in isolation – it was tied to the
    appellant’s concern about the space it was being offered.  There was also
    evidence of the pattern of negotiations by an agent representing the respondent
    offering to pay rent at or above the ultimate rate charged for the new market.   In
    our view, the record as a whole reveals sufficient evidence to support the
    trial judge’s inference that had the appellant offered the respondent the
    size and quality of space to which the respondent was entitled, the respondent
    would have paid the applicable rate charged to all tenants for rent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><i>2. Renewal of the lease</i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s second ground of appeal is the contention that the respondent
    failed to give proper notice to renew the lease and, therefore, was not entitled
    to rely on the demolition clause.  We disagree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the appellant invoked the demolition clause during the term of the appellant’s
    lease and thereby triggered its obligations under the demolition clause. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    on the assumption that the respondent was required to renew its lease to
    invoke the demolition clause, we would not interfere with the trial judge’s
    finding that the respondent had done so.  There was evidence the trial judge
    accepted that the appellant had given oral notice of its intention to renew
    the lease and that the appellant’s agent had agreed to renew the lease.  The
    appellant would, in our view, be estopped by its own conduct from insisting
    upon formal compliance with the renewal cause in the lease. The appellant
    had acted on oral renewals several times in the past. Moreover, the appellant
    purported to satisfy the demolition clause. It advanced the position that
    the respondent was not entitled to the benefit of the demolition clause only
    when the respondent objected to the space it was being offered and commenced
    this proceeding.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>Conclusion </b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, the appeal is dismissed.  In accordance with the agreement
    of counsel, costs are fixed at $25,000 inclusive of GST and disbursements.</p>
