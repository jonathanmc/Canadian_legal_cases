    to the 1985 amendments to the <i>Indian Act</i>, it was possible to surrender
    one’s legal status as an Indian and one’s membership in a Band in exchange
    for Canadian citizenship and the right to hold land in fee simple through “enfranchisement”.
     Once a person had been enfranchised, their descendants also lost their right
    to Indian status.  The purpose of enfranchisement was to facilitate the federal
    government’s attempts to assimilate Aboriginal peoples into the mainstream
    population.  The Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples described enfranchisement
    as being amongst the most “oppressive amendments and practices” in the history
    of the <i>Indian Act</i>: see <i>Report of the Royal Commission on Aboriginal
    Peoples: Looking Forward, Looking Back</i>, vol. 1 (Ottawa: Canada Communication
    Group Publishing) at pp. 282 and 286.  The federal government has attempted
    to redress the effects of enfranchisement; however, as explained below, in
    some instances, the remedy may be seen as incomplete. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    1952, Laura Flood was ostensibly voluntarily enfranchised by an Order-in-Council.  Her
    position, however, is that the enfranchisement was obtained by fraud.  In
    1985, the <i>Indian Act</i> was amended to allow those who had previously
    lost their Indian status for a variety of reasons to re-register.  Laura
    Flood applied to the Registrar of the Indian Register, and was registered
    pursuant to s. 6(1)(d) of the <i>Indian Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-5, which
    allows for the registration of those who had been previously enfranchised
    voluntarily.  Because she re-registered after having been enfranchised, her
    daughter, Dorothy Flood, was required to register pursuant to s. 6(2).  Since
    the descendants of those registered under s. 6(2) are not entitled to registration,
    Dorothy Flood’s daughter, Angel Larkman, was not entitled to be registered
    as an Indian.
     Laura Flood, Dorothy Flood, and Angel Larkman (collectively, the respondents)
    appealed to the Registrar seeking registration pursuant to s. 6(1)(a).  The
    Registrar refused and the respondents appealed to the Superior Court seeking
    to have Laura Flood registered as if she had never been enfranchised.  This
    would result in her registration being made pursuant to s. 6(1)(a), which
    would, in turn, if certain conditions were met, secure entitlement to registration
    for her descendants as well.  The Superior Court judge allowed the appeal
    and the Crown appeals to this court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    central issue on this appeal is whether, in carrying out the duties prescribed
    by statute, the Registrar has the authority or the discretion to look behind
    an Order-in-Council enfranchising someone and to rule on its validity.</p>

    Ontario. She is a member of the Matachewan First Nation, and was registered

    “Laura Batisse” in accordance with the <i>Indian Act</i>, S.C. 1951, c. 29.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    request for Laura Batisse’s enfranchisement was granted by Order-in-Council
    P.C. 4582 dated December 4, 1952 pursuant to the <i>Indian Act</i>.  At that
    time, a person who was enfranchised was entitled to one per capita share
    of the capital and revenue monies held on behalf of the Band, and an amount
    equal to the amount that the person would have received during the next twenty
    years under the applicable treaty.  In Laura Flood’s case, this amounted
    to $82.23.  Laura Flood swore that she never received the $82.23 that was
    owed to her.  As a result of enfranchisement, Laura Flood lost her interest
    in the reserve land, and lost all legislative benefits that flow to Indians,
    such as the right to reside on the reserve, the right to a tax exemption,
    and the right to vote in Band elections.</p>

    1985, the federal government introduced Bill C-31 in order to eliminate the
    assimilation policies embodied in the <i>Indian Act</i>; it did so by removing
    the voluntary and involuntary enfranchisement provisions.  In addition, the
    amendments allowed for the re-registering of those who had been enfranchised.

    a person had been voluntarily enfranchised, he or she would not have been “entitled
    to be registered” prior to the 1985 amendments to the <i>Indian Act</i>.  That
    person would not, therefore, be registered pursuant to s. 6(1)(a). Instead,
    she would be registered pursuant to s.&nbsp;6(1)(d).  The difference is significant
    because the children of a woman registered pursuant to s. 6(1)(a), who are
    born prior to April 17, 1985, who are illegitimate or whose father was an
    Indian, would themselves be “entitled to be registered” prior to the 1985
    amendments to the Act.  As a result, these children would also be entitled
    to registration pursuant to s. 6(1)(a).  In contrast, the children of women
    who are registered pursuant to s. 6(1)(d), and who do not meet the criteria
    of any of the subsections under s. 6(1), can only be registered pursuant
    to s.&nbsp;6(2).  A person whose parent is registered pursuant to s. 6(2)
    is not entitled to be registered under the <i>Indian Act</i> (unless of course
    entitlement to registration flows to this person from the other parent).  In
    this way, the statutory provisions aimed at redressing the previous enfranchisement
    regime appear to treat descendants of an enfranchised person differently
    than the descendants of a person who was never enfranchised.</p>

    on April 7, 1995, the respondents, and Aboriginal Legal Services of Toronto
    (ALST) on behalf of the respondents, wrote to the Registrar on multiple occasions
    requesting that Laura and Dorothy Flood be registered pursuant to s. 6(1)(a).
    They argued that Laura Flood’s enfranchisement was invalid as it had been
    obtained by fraud.  The Registrar responded that there was no reason to revisit
    the earlier decisions.  On November 26, 1996, ALST again wrote to the Registrar
    asking the Registrar to investigate the validity of Laura Flood’s enfranchisement.  The
    Registrar agreed to do so and by means of a letter dated August 18, 1997
    conveyed her conclusion that Laura Flood’s enfranchisement was valid. </p>

    August 17, 1998, a notice of protest of the Registrar’s decision was filed
    on behalf of Laura Flood and Angel Larkman.  The various affidavits filed
    by Laura Flood explained, among other things, that:</p>

  <p>(d)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>it
    is unlikely that she would instruct the Indian agent to proceed with her
    application despite the fact that by doing so she would lose her timber royalties
    when she did not know what a timber royalty was.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    she acknowledges that the signature on the application for enfranchisement
    is hers, Laura Flood states that she did not know what she was signing.  According
    to Laura Flood, Chief Alfred Batisse and the Indian agent requested that
    she sign the document in 1952.  She trusted her Chief and always obeyed the
    instructions of the Indian agent.  She did not know nor was she told that
    she would be giving up her Indian status by signing the document.  She states
    that had she known, she would never have signed it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    letter dated July 21, 2000, the Registrar responded to the notice of protest
    confirming her earlier decision declaring that the enfranchisement was valid
    and declining to alter the registration status of the respondents. </p>
  <h3>4) The decision of the Superior Court</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    appeal, the Superior Court judge found that the Registrar had engaged in
    speculation and had made findings based on a complete absence of evidence.  Further,
    the Registrar erred by imposing on Laura Flood the burden of proving each
    individual piece of evidence rather than addressing the burden of proof on
    the basis of the evidence as a whole, and by imposing a requirement for corroboration
    where none exists at law.  The Superior Court judge then concluded that Laura
    Flood had demonstrated that the enfranchisement was invalid.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Superior Court judge also considered the issue of jurisdiction.  The Crown’s
    position was that in issuing the Order-in-Council enfranchising Laura Flood,
    the Governor-in-Council acted as a federal board, commission or other tribunal
    as defined in s. 2 of the <i>Federal Courts Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. F-7.  Pursuant
    to s. 18 of the <i><span lang=EN-US>Federal Courts Act</span></i>, the Federal
    Court has the exclusive jurisdiction to review the validity of the Order-in-Council.  As
    a result, neither the Registrar nor the Superior Court could look behind
    the Order-in-Council. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Superior Court judge disagreed with the Crown’s position and found that the <i>Indian
    Act</i> conferred jurisdiction on the Registrar to determine whether an individual
    is entitled to registration as well as the provision under which the individual
    is entitled to be registered.  She concluded that the Registrar’s jurisdiction
    is not circumscribed by prior enfranchisement decisions of the Governor-in-Council
    except in limited circumstances not applicable in the present case.  Accordingly,
    the Superior Court judge allowed the appeal and ordered that Laura Flood,
    Dorothy Flood and Angel Larkman each be registered pursuant to s. 6(1)(a)
    of the <i>Indian Act</i>.</p>

      registered as an Indian.  The 1985 amendments now allow a person who has
      been voluntarily or involuntarily enfranchised to regain their status as
      an Indian and to be registered.  Registration of involuntarily enfranchised
      persons is pursuant to s. 6(1)(c) and registration of voluntarily enfranchised
      persons is pursuant to s.&nbsp;6(1)(d).  As explained earlier, registration

    the Quebec Court of Appeal held that the Registrar, when determining entitlement
    to registration, erred in refusing to look beyond an adoption order that
    had been made by the Court of Quebec.  The Quebec Court of Appeal reasoned
    that the Registrar could not simply accept the adoption order as being determinative
    of the issue of whether the applicant met the definition of child in the <i>Indian

      do not view the <i>Innu </i>decision as being of assistance to the respondents.  I
      say so for two reasons. First, in <i>Innu</i>, the Registrar was presented
      with an adoption order made when the applicant was thirty-seven years old.  Under
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Quebec law, it was not always necessary for an adult adoptee seeking an adoption

    in <i>Innu</i> accepted the applicant’s evidence that an <i>in loco parentis</i> situation
    existed when the applicant was a minor, the Band challenging the applicant’s
    eligibility to be registered on the Band list was not a party to the adoption
    proceedings. The Band relied on the Indian and Northern Affairs Canada (INAC)
    policy which stipulates that in order to acquire entitlement to Indian status
    through adoption, individuals who were adopted as adults must demonstrate
    that they were adopted in all practical senses of the term while still a
    minor. The applicant in <i>Innu</i> provided, in addition to his adoption
    order, sworn statements seeking to establish that he had been raised by a
    status Indian. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      Band Council protested the addition of the applicant’s name to its Band
      list. It claimed that the adoption order had been obtained on the basis
      of false statements and provided affidavit evidence stating that the applicant
      had not been brought up by a status Indian.  The Registrar held that it
      was beyond her jurisdiction to resolve the matter; in order for the Band’s
      protest to succeed, it must first have the adoption order declared null
      and void by a court.  The Quebec Court of Appeal held that the Registrar
      erred in failing to exercise the jurisdiction conferred on her by ss. 14.2(5)
      and (6) of the <i>Indian Act</i>, which require the Registrar to “cause
      an investigation to be made”, receive evidence, and “render a decision” when
      a protest is made.  The Registrar could not rely solely on the adoption
      order.  An adoption order obtained as an adult was not determinative because
      the applicant also had to show that the adoption occurred when the applicant
      was a minor, pursuant to the INAC policy.  </span></p>

      Orders-in-Council are quite different from adoption orders made by a provincial
      court.  Orders-in-Council were an integral part of the <i>Indian Act</i> and
      are the specific instruments that are determinative of the right of an
      applicant to be registered pursuant to ss. 6(1)(c) and 6(1)(d).  Where
      the Registrar is satisfied that an applicant was enfranchised by an Order-in-Council,
      the Act directs the Registrar to register the individual under s. 6(1)(c)
      where the enfranchisement was involuntary and under s.&nbsp;6(1)(d) where
      it was voluntary.  By conferring on the Registrar the power to conduct
      an investigation pursuant to ss. 14.2(5) and (6), Parliament did not, however,
      make the Registrar into a court of competent jurisdiction with the power
      to judicially review existing Orders-in-Council or the discretion to disregard

      to the Superior Court on appeal to find that Laura Flood was “entitled” to
      be registered under s. 6(1)(a) if they concluded that Laura Flood had established
      that the Order-in-Council was obtained by fraud.  In other words, the term “entitled” is
      sufficiently broad such that if the Registrar is satisfied that the Order-in-Council
      was obtained by fraud, the Registrar could conclude that an “entitlement” had
      been made out.</span></p>

      my view, the fact that Laura Flood may be able to prove that the Order-in-Council
      was obtained by fraud does not create an “entitlement” to registration
      under s.&nbsp;6(1)(a).  Reading the section as a whole and in context,
      it is clear to me that the entitlement contemplated in s. 6(1)(a) is a
      right (the French version of the statute uses the term “droit”) based on
      the status of the applicant when the Registrar is called upon to make a
      determination.  At that point, Laura Flood was a person whose name had
      been “omitted or deleted from the Indian Register … under subparagraph
      12(1)(a)(iii) pursuant to an order made under subsection 109(1), as each
      provision read immediately prior to April 17, 1985”.  As at April 16, 1985,
      s. 12(1)(a)(iii) of the Act provided that a person who is enfranchised
      is “not entitled to be registered”.  Until the Order-in-Council is set
      aside, therefore, Laura Flood is not a person “entitled to be registered
      immediately prior to April 17, 1985”. </span></p>

      respondents further argue that ss. 4(2) and 4(2.1) of the Act show that
      Parliament intended that the Registrar was to have exclusive jurisdiction

      of the Governor-in-Council affecting registration would be contrary to
      the letter and spirit of the legislation and the intent of Parliament.</span></p>

      to the 1985 amendments to the <i>Indian Act</i>, the Governor-in-Council
      could exempt any Indians or Bands from any part of the <i>Indian Act</i>,
      including the registration provisions.  The 1985 amendments, however, removed
      from the Governor-in-Council the authority to exempt Indians from the registration
      sections of the <i>Indian Act</i> and this, in the respondents’ view, lends
      support to the conclusion that it was intended that the Registrar have
      exclusive jurisdiction over the determination of status.</span></p>

      addition, s.&nbsp;4(2.1) of the Act deems certain prior enfranchisement
      exemption decisions by the Governor-in-Council to be still valid.  The
      purpose of this section was to preserve the interim orders exempting Bands
      from the mandatory involuntary enfranchisement provisions.  These interim
      orders had been made in order to rectify the effect of the discriminatory
      provisions of the old <i>Indian Act</i> in the period before the Act could
      be amended.  The respondents argue that because the 1985 amendments explicitly
      preserved the validity of some prior orders but were silent respecting
      voluntary Orders-in-Council, this suggests that Parliament intended that
      full jurisdiction over the determination of registration was now vested
      in the Registrar and not in the Governor-in-Council.  Prior proclamations
      of the Governor-in-Council (except those specifically addressed in s. 4(2.1))
      would, therefore, not be binding on the Registrar.  Pursuant to the 1985
      amendments, the Registrar had become the final arbiter of registration
      and the Governor-in-Council had been removed from the process.  I disagree.  </span></p>

      my view, these provisions are of no assistance in addressing whether the
      Registrar has the discretion to ignore or overturn Orders-in-Council.  While
      it is true that s. 4(2.1) makes specific reference to the Governor-in-Council
      being deemed to have had the power to make orders exempting Bands from
      the mandatory involuntary enfranchisement provisions of the Act as it read
      prior to 1985, it does not follow, in my view, that all other orders of
      the Governor-in-Council made prior to 1985 are voided or are to be taken
      as having been made without authority.  If that were so none of the enfranchisement
      orders made before 1985 would be subsisting and ss. 6(1)(c) and 6(1)(d)
      would serve no purpose.  </span></p>

      I do not interpret these sections as transferring the jurisdiction of the
      Governor-in-Council regarding Orders-in-Council to the Registrar.  The
      fact that the 1985 amendments removed the Governor-in-Council’s power to
      enfranchise persons does not, by implication, mean that the power to reverse
      enfranchisement decisions has been conferred on the Registrar.  The Act
      specifically provides how the Registrar is to deal with applications by
      enfranchised persons.  There is no statutory provision that, explicitly

      by 2008 FCA 368, stands for the proposition that, by providing that an
      appeal from a Registrar’s order is to a provincial superior court, the
      Federal Court no longer has jurisdiction to deal with questions relating
      to Indian status.  As a result, the jurisdiction of the Registrar and of
      the provincial superior court should be taken to extend to declaring invalid
      or at a minimum looking behind Orders-in-Council that impact on a person’s
      Indian status.  I disagree.</span></p>

      that an appeal from a Registrar’s decision is to the provincial superior
      court and that a Registrar’s decision cannot be circumvented by going to
      the Federal Court.  In <i>Callihoo</i>, the applicant sought a declaration
      in Federal Court that she was entitled to registration.  In effect, what
      she was doing was trying to reverse the Registrar’s previous refusal to
      register her.  The court properly concluded that pursuant to the statute,
      any attempt to overturn the Registrar’s decision has to be brought in the
      provincial superior court.  The case before us is quite different.  Here
      the respondents are trying to circumvent an existing Order-in-Council,
      not a decision of the Registrar.  In my view, therefore, <i>Callihoo</i> has

      the Registrar register Laura Flood under a section of the Act as if the
      Order-in-Council did not exist or was not binding.  As the Superior Court
      is sitting on appeal from the Registrar’s decision, the Superior Court’s

      2008 ONCA 892.  Those claims invoked, in part, the inherent jurisdiction

      court concluded that, by granting the Federal Court exclusive jurisdiction
      over judicial review of decisions by federal boards, commissions or other
