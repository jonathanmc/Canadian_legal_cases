    is a motion by Aviva Insurance Company (Aviva) for security for costs in
    the amount of $5000 pursuant to Rule 61.06(1) (a) of the <i>Rules of Civil
    Procedure</i>, as amended, which reads as follows:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>61.06(1) In an appeal where it appears that,</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a) there is good reason to believe that the
    appeal is frivolous and vexatious and that the appellant has insufficient
    assets in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario to pay the costs of the appeal;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>a judge of the appellate court, on motion by the
    respondent, may make such order for security for costs of the proceeding
    and of the appeal as is just. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>I.          The Background
      Facts and the Motions Judge’s Decision</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lindhorst
    brought an action for damages in the amount of $750,000 for personal injuries
    arising out of a motor vehicle action with an unidentified driver.  Aviva,
    Lindhorst’s insurer, alleged that on February 1, 2008, it reached an agreement
    with Lindhorst’s counsel whereby Lindhorst agreed to pay Aviva $1,348, execute
    a release, and to consent to a without costs dismissal of the action.  When
    Lindhorst refused to execute the release provided by Aviva, Lindhorst’s counsel
    removed himself from the record.  Aviva brought a motion to enforce the alleged
    settlement.  Lindhorst brought a cross-motion seeking, among other things:
    a trial; dismissal of Aviva’s motion; an order that Aviva cease and desist
    from damaging Lindhorst’s reputation; and an order that the court records
    be sealed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motions judge held that Lindhorst’s counsel’s retainer was established, that
    Lindhorst’s counsel had authority to bind his client, that settlement implied
    a promise to furnish a release absent an agreement to the contrary, and that
    Aviva’s release was “nothing out of the ordinary.”  She further held that
    the fact that Lindhorst had not accepted Aviva’s release did not discharge
    him from his obligations as “[t] his is not a situation where certain items
    regarding the settlement were raised for the first time after February 1,
    2008 and [Aviva did not raise] included terms that were not agreed upon”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    noting that Aviva had orally represented that it was willing to waive execution
    of a release, the motions judge granted Aviva’s motion to dismiss Lindhorst’s
    action on a without costs basis.  Instead of ordering Lindhorst to pay Aviva
    $1,348 representing certain costs orders, she granted costs of the motion
    to Aviva in the amount of $3,950 payable within 30 days.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motions judge also dismissed Lindhorst’s motion. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lindhorst
    has appealed both the order granted to Aviva and the dismissal of his own
    motion, as well as the costs award made against him.  In order for Aviva
    to be granted security for its costs in the appeal, it must demonstrate that
    there is good reason to believe: (a) that Lindhorst’s appeal is frivolous
    and vexatious;  and (b) that Lindhorst has insufficient assets in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario to pay the costs of the appeal. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>II.        Analysis</span></h4>
  <h3>(i)        Is there good reason to believe that Lindhorst’s appeal is frivolous
    and vexatious?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dealing
    first with the settlement motion, the motions judge’s reasons are clear and
    detailed.  She correctly stated and applied the law and does not appear to
    have misapprehended the evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motions judge did not apportion her award of costs between the two motions.  Assuming
    that the award of costs relates to Aviva’s motion, Lindhorst’s argument on
    the costs award is that he would have accepted the terms that Aviva’s counsel
    orally agreed to before the motions judge.  He submits that, consequently,
    he ought not to have been ordered to pay the costs of the motion.  Lindhorst
    did not make a formal offer to settle on the terms awarded by the motions
    judge.  Aviva’s failure to offer to settle on terms that were as favourable
    as those ultimately awarded by the motions judge is not a reason to deny
    it costs.  I see nothing to suggest that the motions judge exercised her
    discretion improperly in making the award that she did.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    the above, there is reason to believe that the appeal of the settlement motion
    is frivolous and vexatious.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lindhorst
    appears to have been under the impression that, in order for me to order
    security for costs, Aviva had to show not only that there did not appear
    to be any merit to the appeal from Aviva’s motion but also that the appeal
    from the dismissal of Lindhorst’s motion was frivolous and vexatious.  I
    do not agree.  It is possible for this court to order security for the costs
    of the appeal of the settlement motion specifically, and refuse to make such
    an order for the appeal of Lindhorst’s motion:  see, by analogy, <i>Hubbell
    Special Products Inc. v. Carroll Healthcare Inc. </i>(2005), 10 C.P.C. (6<sup>th</sup>)
    10 (Ont. S.C.J.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    it is not necessary for me to bifurcate Lindhorst’s appeal in this manner,
    as there is reason to believe thathis appeal from the dismissal of his own
    motion is also frivolous and vexatious.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lindhorst’s
    appeal from the dismissal of his motion primarily relates to the allegations
    of defamation.  Three of his grounds of appeal relate to the motions judge’s
    finding that a former employer made certain comments about him to Aviva.  I
    see no palpable and overriding error in the motions judge’s conclusion.  The
    fourth ground of appeal, whether the alleged statement was defamatory, raises
    a question of law, and again, the motions judge does not appear to have erred
    in her statement or application of the law. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lindhorst’s
    final two grounds of appeal relate to the motions judge’s refusal to strike
    the documents in question from the record or to seal them.  Deciding whether
    or not to seal documents is a matter within the court’s discretion: <i>Boeing
    Satellite Systems International Inc. v. Telesat Canada</i>,<i> </i>[2007]
    O.J. No. 77 (S.C.), citing <i>Sierra Club of
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    v.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    (Minister of Finance), </i>[2002] 2 S.C.R. 522.  I see no error in principle
    in the manner in which she exercised her discretion.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the complaint that the motions judge perpetuated the harm by publishing the
    comments in her judgment is without foundation, as her judgment was privileged.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All
    of the grounds of appeal advanced by Lindhorst in regards to the appeal from
    the dismissal of his motion thus appear to be frivolous and vexatious.</p>
  <h3><span>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Has
    Aviva shown that Lindhorst has insufficient assets in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario to pay the costs of the appeal?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    support of its submission, Aviva states that the condominium unit in which
    Lindhorst resides is not owned by him and that he has no other real estate
    in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto.  Aviva also relies on evidence that Lindhorst is unemployed.  Thus,
    Aviva submits that there is good reason to doubt that he has sufficient assets
    to pay the costs of his appeals.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lindhorst
    submits that he is responsible where credit is concerned.  He has three credit
    cards, pays his bills and maintains a good credit rating.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Horton
      v. Joyce </i>(1994), 20 O.R. (3d) 59 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), Finlayson J.A. described the test under rule 61.06(1)(a) as asking whether
    the appeal is frivolous and whether the appellant is “irresponsible”.  However,
    having regard to the decision as a whole, Finlayson J.A. did not depart from
    the plain meaning of the rule.  In <i>Schmidt v. Toronto-Dominion Bank </i>(1995),
    24 O.R. (3d) 1 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), at p. 6, this court noted that this second criterion under the rule is
    clear and requires no judicial gloss.  Despite the language used in <i>Horton</i>,
    the fact that Lindhorst is financially responsible is not relevant to the
    application of the rule.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    rule does not require that Aviva actually show that Lindhorst has insufficient
    assets to pay the costs of an appeal but, rather, that there is good reason
    to doubt that he has.  I am satisfied that Aviva has met the test.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    for these reasons I allow Aviva’s motion for security for costs and order
    that Lindhorst post security for costs in the amount of $5,000.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    order that the costs of this motion, fixed in the amount of $1,000 all inclusive,
    be paid by Lindhorst to Aviva. </p>
