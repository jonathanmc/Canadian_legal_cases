      the oral hearing of this appeal, the respondent brought a motion to quash
      the appeal on the basis that Van Melle J.’s order was interlocutory and
      not final.  An appeal from an interlocutory order lies to the

      January 2005, the respondent commenced proceedings to set aside the separation
      agreement.  Her claim is based principally on the appellant’s alleged failure
      to fully disclose his financial circumstances.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      proceedings have not progressed smoothly and numerous orders have been
      made.  Several of these orders relate to the lack of financial disclosure
      by the appellant.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
      January 16, 2008, Corbett J. ordered the appellant to disclose various
      financial documents that were considered central to the issue in the proceedings.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
      April 22, 2008, the respondent sought to have the appellant’s pleadings
      struck for failure to produce the required documents.  Corbett J. rejected
      the appellant’s explanation for the delay and ordered disclosure of the
      documents by April 25, 2008, failing which the appellant was to pay a fine
      of $2,500 per day for every day that the documentary disclosure was not
      made. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>By
      June 2008, the ordered disclosure had not been made.  The respondent filed
      a further motion seeking to strike the appellant’s pleadings, and for an
      order that the appellant pay her the $2,500 fine per day for each day of
      non-disclosure following the April 25, 2008 deadline.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
      July 8, 2008, before the return date of the motion, the appellant made
      the requisite disclosure.  Van Melle J. heard the motion and, on September
      22, 2008, ordered the appellant to comply with the fine provision of Corbett
      J.’s order by paying to the respondent a fine in the amount of $185,000.  This
      total represented a fine of $2,500 per day for the appellant’s 74-day delay
      in producing the documents. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant appealed the order to this court.  The principal basis advanced
      for the appeal is that payment of a fine can only be ordered following
      a finding of contempt. Contempt proceedings are provided for in Rule 31
      of the <i>Family Law Rules</i>, O. Reg. 114/99.  Since no motion for contempt
      was brought by the respondent and the procedure set out in Rule 31 was
      not followed, the appellant argues that the motion judge did not have the
      jurisdiction to order payment of a fine.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
      the date set for the appeal, the respondent brought a motion to quash the
      appeal on the basis that the order under appeal is interlocutory.  She
      submits that an appeal from the order lies not to this court, but to the

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Subsection
      6(1)(b) of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, provides
      that an appeal lies to the Court of Appeal from a final order of a judge
      of the Superior Court of Justice.  Subsection 19(1)(b) of the <i>Courts
      of Justice Act</i> further provides that an appeal from an interlocutory
      order of a judge of the Superior Court of Justice lies to the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court, with leave of that court.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For
      purposes of the <i>Courts of Justice Act,</i> an order is generally considered
      final if it finally determines the real matter in dispute between the parties
      or deprives a defendant of a substantive right which could be determinative
      of the action: see <i>Buck Bros. Ltd. v. Frontenac Builders Ltd.</i> (1994),
      19 O.R. (3d) 97 (C.A.).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>An
      interlocutory order, however, is an order which “does not determine the
      real matter in dispute between the parties – the very subject matter of
      the litigation, but only some matter collateral.  It may be final in the
      sense that it determines the very question raised by the application, but
      it is interlocutory if the merits of the case remain to be determined”:  <i>Hendrickson
      v. Kallio</i>, [1932] O.R. 675 (C.A.), at p. 678.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Quite
      apart from the jurisprudence under the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, Rule
      2(1) of the <i>Family Law Rules</i> provides a definition of the term final
      order as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>“final order” means an order,
      other than a temporary order, that decides a claim in an application, including, </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>a) an order made on motion that
      changes a final order, </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>b) a judgment, and </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>c) an order that decides a party’s
      rights, in an issue between the parties or between a party and a non-party;</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Notwithstanding
    the appellant’s claim that, on the basis of the proceedings and material
    before her, Van Melle J. could not and in fact did not make a finding of
    contempt, his position that the order under appeal is a final order rests
    on the assumption that it is, in substance if not in form, a contempt order.  He
    argues that Rule 31, which allows the court to impose a finding of contempt
    against a party in breach of an order, is the only provision of the <i>Family
    Law Rules</i> that allows for the imposition of a fine or monetary penalty.  Because
    a fine was imposed by Van Melle J., the order must therefore be a contempt
    order. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    finding that a party is in contempt of court
    “is a serious matter that is quasi-criminal in nature”: <i>Bell Express Vu
    Limited Partnership v. Corkery</i>, 2009 ONCA 85, at para. 20.  The significance
    of this is such that a contempt order is considered to be a final order,
    an appeal from which lies directly to this court: <i>Bush v. Mereshensky </i>(2007), <span
class=ssl21><span style='color:windowtext'><span style='
color:windowtext'>43 R.F.L. (6th) 267</span> (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
  ), at para. 10. </span></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the respondent argues that Van Melle J.’s order cannot be considered a contempt
    order.  A finding of contempt was not sought in any of the motions before
    Van Melle J. or Corbett J.  In any event, neither Van Melle J. nor Corbett
    J. addressed the issue of contempt or made findings in that regard.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent submits that the authority for imposing a fine exists quite apart
    from the contempt provisions of the <i>Family Law Rules</i>. Specifically,
    she refers to three provisions of the <i>Family Law Rules</i> which she claims
    support her position that the court was entitled to make any order it considered
    appropriate in view of the appellant’s failure to obey Corbett J.’s disclosure
    order: </p>
  <p><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Rule
    1(8) provides that the court may, where an order has not been complied with,
    make “any order that it considers necessary for a just determination of the
    matter, on any conditions that the court considers appropriate, including …”</p>
  <p><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Rule
    14(23) provides that on a motion for failure to obey an order that was made
    on motion, the court may “in addition to any other remedy allowed under these
    rules, </p>
  <p>…</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>(c) make any other order that is appropriate, including
    an order for costs.”</p>
  <p><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Rule
    19(10) provides that the court may, on motion, make various orders where
    a party has failed to comply with an order to disclose documents.  Such orders
    include a contempt order, but also include “any other order that is appropriate.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent argues that any of these rules gave Corbett J. the necessary authority
    to order the appellant to pay a fine in the event that he failed to comply
    with the disclosure order and produce the required documents.  Van Melle
    J.’s order for payment of the fine did no more than apply the terms of Corbett
    J.’s order.
     The respondent submits that no finding of contempt was sought or made and
    the order for the payment of the fine did not finally dispose of any issue
    in the proceedings.  I agree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the order under appeal is not final.  It is clear from the record
    that neither Corbett J. nor Van Melle J. made a finding of contempt.  Further,
    the order does not, in any way, finally dispose of an issue in the proceeding
    nor does it deprive the appellant of a possible defence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    parties argued the motion principally on the basis that the definition of
    a final order in Rule 2(1) of the <i>Family Law Rules</i> should be applied
    to determine whether Van Melle J.’s order is final or interlocutory.  Assuming
    without deciding that this definition applies, I reach the same conclusion
    whether Rule 2(1) of the <i>Family Law Rules</i> or the case law developed
    under the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i> is applied.  The order under appeal
    is interlocutory and the appeal lies to the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court, with leave of that court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    central issue raised in this appeal is whether, absent a finding of contempt,
    a judge has the jurisdiction under the <i>Family Law Rules</i> to impose
    and order payment of a fine as part of the case management process.  In other
    words, as submitted by the respondent, is the authority conferred by any
    of Rules 1(8), 14(23) or 19(10) broad enough to allow for the making of such
    orders?  Whether a fine or penalty can be imposed absent a finding of contempt,
    and to whom the fine is payable, are novel issues and are important.  The
    novelty and importance of the issues do not, however, make the order into
    a final one for purposes of appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    conclusion, the motion to quash is allowed.  The appeal is quashed with costs
    to the respondent fixed in the amount of $7,500.</p>
