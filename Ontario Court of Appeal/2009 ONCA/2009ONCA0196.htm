    case raises issues concerning limitation periods, administration of estates
    and liability of executors for misconduct by other executors.  The appellant
    Sylvia Bennett is an executor of the estate of Lorraine Penna.  Lorraine
    Penna in turn was an executor of the estate of her husband Paul Penna.  It
    is alleged that another of the Paul Penna estate trustees, Barry Landen,
    looted that estate.  The new Paul Penna estate trustee seeks to hold the
    Lorraine Penna estate liable for some of the losses in a summary judgment
    motion.  </p>

    appellant submits that any claims against the Lorraine Penna estate are barred
    by virtue of the expiration of the limitation period in s. 38(3) of the <i>Trustee
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. T.23. She moved for a declaration to that effect.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    J. dismissed the appellant’s motion for a declaration.  She held that the
    combined effect of the <i>Trustee Act</i>, the former <i>Limitations Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. L.15, the <i>Limitations Act 2002</i>, S.O. 2002, c. 24,
    Sch. B, and the <i>Estates Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. E.21, was that there
    was no limitation period.  In my view, the appeal should be allowed in part.
    There is a limitation period, namely s. 38(3), that bars any claims against
    the Lorraine Penna estate in the summary judgment motion.  </p>

line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Paul
    Penna passed away on August 29, 1996.  His will appointed his wife Lorraine
    Penna, Charles Langston and Barry Landen to be the executors of the will
    and trustees of his estate.  The most significant asset of the estate was
    shares in Paul Penna’s holding company, Jakmin Investments Ltd.  Upon his
    death, the three executors also became directors of Jakmin.  Lorraine Penna
    held a life interest in Paul Penna’s estate.  On her death, the residual
    beneficiaries were a number of charities.  At the time of Paul Penna’s death,
    the estate had a value of approximately $24 million.  By February 2004, the
    value of the estate had dropped to $590,000.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Paul Penna executors did not probate his will and left administration of
    the estate and of Jakmin in the hands of Landen.  For example, there were
    never any meetings of the directors of Jakmin and Landen used a rubber stamp
    to affix Langston’s name to cheques issued on behalf of Jakmin and the estate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    at least 1999, Lorraine Penna’s mental health had begun to deteriorate to
    the point that on October 14, 1999, Ernie Sheriff, Paul Penna’s nephew, replaced
    her as director of Jakmin.  Inexplicably, Sheriff did not replace Lorraine
    as executor and trustee of Paul Penna’s estate.  In 2002, Lorraine was moved
    out of her home into a care facility and was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease.  She
    passed away on December 18, 2003.  Sheriff was appointed executor and trustee
    of the Paul Penna estate in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Lorraine’s place.  Landen and the appellant, Lorraine’s sister, became the

line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An
    affidavit by Langston dated February 28, 2005 attaches a report from LECG,
    a forensic accounting firm.  The report accounts for some $11 million which
    may be legitimate expenses of the Paul Penna estate, such as a tax liability
    of $7.2 million and other debts.  The firm was not able to account for another
    $11.6 million missing from the estate, except for approximately $4.5 million
    in “questionable items”, most of which relate to actions by Landen.  The
    only mention of Lorraine Penna is that an unknown amount may have been paid
    for her living expenses.  In a more detailed report from the firm dated January
    23, 2006, Landen is reported to have withdrawn approximately $92,796 in cash
    disbursements for the care and maintenance of Lorraine Penna. In a response
    to the LECG report, Landen appears to accept some of the findings in the
    report.</p>

    March 1, 2005, Langston, Sheriff and Jakmin issued a notice of action against
    Landen, his wife and their company.  On March 2, 2005, Wilton-Siegel J. issued
    a Mareva injunction freezing Landen’s assets. </p>

    March 31, 2005, Langston, Sheriff and Jakmin commenced an action against
    Landen, his wife and their company.  The statement of claim alleges that
    Landen misappropriated funds from the Paul Penna estate and from Jakmin.  For
    example, it is alleged that Landen arranged to pay himself large sums from
    the estate, sold shares held by Jakmin and used the proceeds to purchase
    a home for himself, caused Jakmin to make various unauthorized payments to
    himself or his company, and generally
    “improperly divested large sums of money from the Estate for his personal
    benefit and for the benefit of his family members and others”.  The claim
    makes no allegations against Lorraine Penna.  In the statement of claim,
    Sheriff and Langston state that they knew nothing of the fraudulent and unauthorized
    activities.</p>

line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    a meeting of counsel on April 20, 2005, which included counsel for the appellant,
    there was discussion of a possible claim against the Lorraine Penna estate.  This
    was followed up by a letter from counsel for one of the charities to counsel
    for the appellant.  The letter contains the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>You have previously
    been put on notice that the beneficiaries of the estate intend to look to
    Lorraine Penna’s estate for damages <i>arising from her negligence </i>while

    a notice of application dated December 21, 2005, the various charities that
    were the residual beneficiaries of the Paul Penna estate brought an application
    to <i>inter alia </i>remove Langston, Sheriff and Landen as executor and
    trustees, replace them with new executors and trustees, and appoint an accounting
    firm as inspector of Jakmin.  While the appellant as executor of the Lorraine
    Penna estate is named as a respondent to this application, the application
    makes no other mention of the Lorraine Penna estate.  For example, while
    the application alleges that Langston, Sheriff and Landen breached their
    obligations as executors and trustees, no mention is made of Lorraine Penna
    or the appellant.</p>

line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    April 7, 2006, the motion judge made an order removing Landen, Sheriff and
    Langston as trustees of the Paul Penna estate and removing Sheriff and Langston
    as directors of Jakmin.  Landen, Sheriff and Langston were ordered to pass
    their accounts as estate trustees of the estate of Paul Penna.  The motion
    judge also made an order adding the estate of Lorraine Penna as a <i>plaintiff</i> to
    the March 1, 2005 action.</p>

    first formal notice to the appellant in any court document of her possible
    liability or the liability of the Lorraine Penna estate to the Paul Penna
    estate is in a notice of motion dated December 4, 2006 seeking partial summary
    judgment in the amount of $412,353 against Landen, Langston and “Sylvia Bennett
    and Barry Landen as Estate Trustees of the Estate of Lorraine Penna”, in
    their capacities as estate trustees of the estate of Paul Penna and directors
    of Jakmin.  The notice of motion bears the same court file number as the
    March 1, 2005 action in which the Lorraine Penna estate is a plaintiff.  The
    allegations against Lorraine Penna are contained in the following paragraphs
    of the notice of motion:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;'>10.       Mrs.
    Penna (now deceased) was possibly incompetent to act as an Estate Trustee
    from in or about 1999, yet Mr.&nbsp;Landen, as her co-trustee and attorney
    under power of attorney, and Mr. Langston as co-trustee did nothing to have
    her removed.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>11.       Mrs.
    Penna, Mr. Sheriff and Mr. Langston took no steps whatsoever to review the
    activities of Mr. Landen concerning the Estate, blindly trusting him to manage
    the Estate, thus abdicating their duties, and as such, breached their fiduciary
    duties as Estate Trustees.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><b>…</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>13.       Mrs.
    Penna, Mr. Sheriff and Mr. Langston breached their duties as directors and,
    for Mr. Langston as an officer (secretary and treasurer), of Jakmin to the
    shareholder of Jakmin (namely, the Estate) by taking no steps whatsoever
    to review the activities of Mr. Landen, thus abdicating their duties, blindly
    trusting Mr. Landen to manage Jakmin.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>14.       The
    former Estate Trustees and Officers and Directors of Jakmin (Mr. Landen,
    Mr. Langston, Mr. Sheriff and Mrs. Penna) have therefore breached their fiduciary
    duties to the beneficiaries of the Estate and are jointly and severally responsible
    for the replenishment to the Estate for the amounts of $412,353.00 (Mr. Landen,
    Mr. Langston and the Estate of Mrs. Penna) and $970,994.57 (Mr. Landen, Mr.&nbsp;Langston,
    the Estate of Mrs. Penna and Mr. Sheriff), together with interest plus any
    amount determined to be an additional loss to the capital of the Estate arising
    from their conduct including but not limited to the failure by them to act
    in the best interests of the shareholder and beneficiaries, to keep an even
    hand, to invest for capital growth, and to invest prudently.</p>

    an order dated December 4, 2006, the motion judge ordered that the “Estate
    of Lorraine Penna, by her Estate Trustees Sylvia Bennett and Barry Landen,
    shall bring an application to pass Estate Accounts from the date of death
    of Mr. Penna to the date of death of Mrs. Penna”.  She also directed a summary
    determination of <i>inter alia</i> whether Landen, Langston and the appellant
    as estate trustees of the Lorraine Penna estate are personally, jointly and/or
    severally liable to the Paul Penna estate for $412,353 “being the amount
    Mr. Landen has admitted that he owes the Estate”.</p>

    September 21, 2007, the motion judge gave partial summary judgment against
    Landen for over $3 million.  In her reasons, she noted that Landen has admitted
    that he never paid the $1 million bequest under the Paul Penna will to Lorraine
    Penna, and invited the Lorraine Penna estate to bring a summary judgment
    motion of its own against Landen.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge found that no limitation period applied.  She rejected the argument
    of the appellant that the two year limitation period under s. 38(3) of the <i>Trustee
    Act</i>, running from Lorraine Penna’s death, applied.  The motion judge
    appears to have relied upon ss. 43 and 44 of the former <i>Limitations Act</i>,
    which she interpreted as preventing any limitation period from running against
    a beneficiary where the claim is based on fraud, fraudulent breach of trust
    or conversion of trust property.  She also rejected the appellant’s submission
    that the <i>Limitations Act, 2002</i> barred the claim.  The motion judge
    also referred to s. 24 of the <i>Limitations Act, 2002,</i> the transition
    provision, and found that no limitation period applied using the rules in
    that section.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge also mentioned s. 47 of the <i>Estates Act</i>.  That provision
    prevents a limitation period from running “where notice of the claim giving
    full particulars of the claim and verified by affidavit, is filed with the
    executor”
    at any time prior to the date upon which the claim would be barred under
    the <i>Trustee Act</i>.  It is unclear whether the motion judge viewed this
    provision as applying to the facts of this case.</p>

    after two years from the death of the deceased.  The claim brought against
    the Lorraine Penna estate falls within the terms of s. 38(2),  even though
    cast in terms of breach of fiduciary duty, see <i>Roth v. Weston Estate</i> (1997),
    36 O.R. (3d) 513 (C.A.). </p>

      v. Hopkinson Estate</i> (2000), 47 O.R. (3d) 370, this court held that
      s. 38(3) establishes an absolute limitation period that is not subject
      to a discoverability exception.  The motion judge at para. 29 appeared
      to hold that if she were wrong and there was a limitation period, the claim
      would not be barred because “the discoverability rule would still apply
      under the circumstances of this case.” In view of <i>Waschkowski</i>, that
      alternative basis for finding the claim against the appellant to proceed
      cannot stand. See Anne Werker,
    “Limitation Records in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario and Claims by Beneficiaries” (2008) 34 Advocates’ Q. 1 at 17. The
    harshness of the inapplicability of the discoverability rule to cases governed
    by s. 38(3) is mitigated somewhat by the doctrine of fraudulent concealment,
    see <i>Giroux Estate v. Trillium Health Centre</i> (2005), 74 O.R. (3d) 341
    (C.A.), at paras. 28-34. However, there was nothing to suggest that the doctrine
    had any application in this case.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    19(1) of the <i>Limitations Act, 2002</i> is engaged since the claim in this
    case is one to which a provision set out in or under another Act applies,
    specifically s. 38(3) of the <i>Trustee Act</i>.  It is also one to which
    the <i>Limitations Act, 2002</i> applies, since the claim is pursued in court
    proceedings and does not fall within any of the exceptions in s. 2.  In these
    circumstances, s. 19(4) is clear.  If there is a conflict between a limitation
    period established by a provision referred to in s. 19(1), such as s. 38(3),
    and a limitation period established by any other provision of the <i>Limitations
    Act, 2002</i>, the limitation period established by a provision such as s.

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    may be that the transition provisions in s. 24 of the Act could produce a
    different result. In my view, however, the term “any other provision of this
    Act” in s. 19 must include the transition provisions of s. 24.  This is consistent
    with the obvious intent of s. 19, which was to preserve a small number of
    limitation periods, which would not be affected by the new legislation.  See <i>York
    Condominium Corp. No. 382 v. Jay-M Holdings Ltd.</i> (2007), 84 O.R. (3d)
    414 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">

line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, this conclusion is consistent with the intent of the Act.  I say
    that for several reasons.  First, the transition provisions are based in
    one way or another on the concept of a “former limitation period”.  It is
    difficult to describe the limitation periods referred to in s. 19 as former
    limitation periods.  As Lederer J. said in <i>Kramarz v. KMH Cardiology &amp; Diagnostic
    Centres</i> (2007), 87 O.R. (3d) 120 (S.C.), at para. 32, “the limitation
    period in the <i>Trustee Act</i> is not a
    ‘former limitation period’ because as a result of s. 19(1) of the <i>Limitations
    Act, 2002</i> it continues in place.  We are not transitioning from one regime
    to another.  The <i>Trustee Act</i> did and does apply.  It is not ‘of… the
    past’.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    if s. 38(3) could properly be described as a former limitation period, the
    result of applying the applicable rule from s. 24 would be that there is
    no limitation period.  The applicable rule is found in s. 24(4), which provides
    as follows:<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>24(4) If the
    former limitation period did not expire before the effective date and if
    no limitation period under this Act would apply were the claim based on an
    act or omission that took place on or after the effective date, there is
    no limitation period.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Assuming
    s. 38(3) contains a former limitation period, it did not expire before the
    effective date.  Since there is “no limitation period under this Act”, there
    would be no limitation period.  I say that there is no limitation period
    under this Act because, in my view, the limitation periods referred to in
    the Schedule are not limitation periods under the <i>Limitation Act, 2002.</i>  This
    is apparent from the opening words of s. 19(1), which refer to a limitation
    period “set out in or under another Act” and provide that such a limitation
    period is of no effect unless the provision establishing it is listed in
    the Schedule.  The provisions listed in the Schedule and preserved by s.
    19(1) are under another Act, not “under this Act” within the meaning of s.
    24(4).  The result is that there is no limitation period.  If s. 24(4) were
    to apply, actions governed by s. 38(3) before and after the <i>Limitations
    Act, 2002</i> came into force would be subject to a strict two-year limitation
    period, while for the small number of actions where the two years did not
    expire before January 1, 2004, there would be no limitation period at all.  The
    Legislature could not have intended such an absurd result.  See <i>Philion
    (Litigation Guardian Of) v. Lemeux (Estate of)</i> (2007), 85 O.R. (3d) 1
    (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  In this regard, I agree with Lederer J.’s comments at para. 29 of <i>Kramarz</i>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>For the few
    cases this approach would govern, there would be no limitation. The potential
    plaintiffs would obtain new rights. They could sue forever. This is different
    from the treatment given to actions that arose before and after the actions
    affected by the transition provisions.</p>

line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    conclude, in my view, s. 38(3) of the <i>Trustee Act</i> applies to this
    case without regard to the transition provisions in s. 24.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The

    the respondents submit that this is not the end of the story.  They argue
    that even if s. 38(3) would otherwise apply, the two year limitation period
    does not run against them because of ss. 43 and 44 of the former <i>Limitations

    or the proceeds thereof, still retained by the trustee”?  If so, what is

    have set out the allegations against Lorraine Penna in the notice of motion
    for partial summary judgment.  The affidavit in support of the motion for
    summary judgment does not add anything to these allegations.  There is no
    allegation that she committed any act of fraud or that she was in possession
    of any trust property.  Accordingly, if the exemption in s. 43 is to apply
    it must rest on the allegation that she was a party or privy to the fraud
    alleged against Landen.  In my view, the allegations against Lorraine Penna
    do not fall within the exemption.  It is alleged that she failed to review
    the activities of Landen, abdicated her duty, and breached her duty to the
    beneficiaries of the estate.  In my view, this did not make her a party to
    or privy to Landen’s fraud within the meaning of the former s. 43.  </p>

    ordinary rule is set out in <i>Waters’ Law of Trusts in Canada</i> at p.
    1212: a trustee “is liable for his personal acts and omissions and not for
    those of his co-trustees” and “does not insure his co-trustee’s honesty,
    attentiveness, or competence”.  The authors go on to explain that this rule
    is mitigated by the fact that trustees’ responsibilities for their own behaviour
    may make them liable for the loss caused by another trustee’s acts, by, for
    example, permitting investments to be held solely in the co-trustees name.  </p>

    Penna might well have been negligent for allowing Landen free reign over
    the administration of the estate.  But that is not enough to bring her within
    the exception in s. 43 as a party or privy to Landen’s fraud.  The term “party” implies
    at least knowledge on her part of the fraud by Landen.  The respondents make
    no such allegation.  A person cannot be a party to a fraud without at least
    knowing or being wilfully blind to the fraud.  </p>

    Judicial Dictionary of Words and Phrases, 5th ed. (London: Sweet &amp; Maxwell

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>As distinguished

    similar definition is found in Daphne A. Dukelow, The Dictionary of Canadian
    Law, 3rd ed. (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Scarborough: Thomson Canada Limited, 2004): “Someone who partakes or has
    an interest in some action or thing”.  The Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd
    ed., gives a number of definitions of “privy”.  The only one that could have
    application in this context is the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Participating
    in the knowledge of something secret or private; in the secret; privately

    allegations against Lorraine Penna do not show that she falls within any
    of these definitions.  She did not take part in the fraud and had no knowledge
    of it.  In my view, ss. 43 and 44 of the former <i>Limitations Act</i> do
    not apply.  While the motion judge referred to ss. 43 and 44, in my view
    she overstated their effect by holding that they were “intended to exempt
    claims for fraud or fraudulent breach of trust or conversion of trust property,
    from all limitation provisions” (para. 15).  The exemption only applies to
    claims against trustees who are party to or privy to the fraud.</p>

    far as I am aware, the meaning of the term “party or privy” in s. 43 has
    never been considered by this court.  However, some assistance in interpreting
    the section can be found in the decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Air
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    v. M &amp; L Travel Ltd.</i>, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 787.  In that case, the court
    was required to consider the liability of directors of a closely-held corporation
    for breach of trust.  The court noted that strangers to the trust can be
    held liable for a breach of trust as trustees de son tort or if they knowingly
    participate in a breach of trust.  It is the latter concept that provides
    a helpful analogy in considering the meaning of party or privy.  The court
    held at p. 810 that a stranger to the trust can be held liable for breach
    of trust “as one in receipt and chargeable with trust property and as one
    who knowingly assisted in a dishonest and fraudulent design on the part of
    the trustees”.  Thus, liability is based on receipt of trust property or
    knowing assistance.  Similarly, the exception in s. 43 applies where the
    trustee is in receipt of trust property or party or privy to the fraud of
    another trustee.  </p>

      Canada</i> at p. 811, the court held that the degree of knowledge required
      for knowing assistance is “actual knowledge; recklessness or wilful blindness”.  At
      p. 812, the court explained the rationale for refusing to impose liability
      on the basis of mere negligence or constructive knowledge:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The reason for
    excluding constructive knowledge (that is, knowledge of circumstances which
    would indicate the facts to an honest person, or knowledge of facts which
    would put an honest person on inquiry) was discussed in <i>In re Montagu's
    Settlement Trusts, supra</i>, at pp. 271-73, 275-85. Megarry V.-C. held,
    at p. 285, that constructive notice was insufficient to bind the stranger's
    conscience so as to give rise to personal liability. While cases involving
    recklessness or wilful blindness indicate a &quot;want of probity which justifies
    imposing a constructive trust&quot;, Megarry V.-C., at p. 285, held that <i>the
    carelessness involved in constructive knowledge cases will not normally amount
    to a want of probity</i>, and will therefore be insufficient to bind the
    stranger's conscience.  [Emphasis added.]</p>

line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Admittedly,
    there are distinctions between the concept under consideration in <i>Air
    Canada</i> and the issues in interpreting s. 43.  Most importantly, s. 43
    applies to a trustee, not a stranger to the trust.  Nevertheless, it seems
    to me that the concept discussed in <i>Air Canada</i> of “want of probity”,
    meaning lack of honesty, captures the notion implicit in the concept of a
    party or privy to a fraud or fraudulent breach of trust.  It cannot be enough
    that the trustee was simply negligent or ought to have known that the co-trustee
    was committing a fraud or fraudulent breach of trust.  Therefore, as with
    the case of a stranger to a trust considered in <i>Air Canada</i>, I would
    hold that a trustee should only be deprived of the benefit of the limitation
    period by operation of s. 43 where the trustee knew or was wilfully blind
    to the actions of the co-trustee.  No such allegations have been made against
    Lorraine Penna.  </p>

      oral and written notice to Lorraine's estate that a Claim would be forthcoming

      replacement co-trustee, Sheriff, took steps against Lorraine's other co-trustee,
      Landen. Clearly, by April 20, 2005, when the informal meeting of various

    the motion judge is incorrect and the claim does fall within s. 47, the respondents

    that s. 38(3) should continue to be governed by common law principles.  The

    this court has held that the doctrine of special circumstances is available
    to permit a court to add parties to an existing action, despite the expiration
    of the limitation period in s. 38(3):  <i>Swain Estate v. Lake of the Woods
    District Hospital</i> (1992), 9 O.R. (3d) 74.  In <i>Swain</i> the special
    circumstances doctrine was applied where the estate was the plaintiff and
    sought to add additional defendants.  Also see <i>Basarsky v. Quinlan, </i>[1972]
    S.C.R. 380.  Although we were not referred to any cases where the special
    circumstances doctrine was applied against an estate, I can see no basis
    in principle for distinguishing the two types of cases.  Both types of cases
    turn on the same limitation period in s. 38(3).  Applying the reasoning in <i>Giroux
    Estate</i>, the doctrine of special circumstances also survives the enactment
    of the <i>Limitation Act, 2002</i>, despite the fact that the doctrine has
    been abolished by s. 20 of that Act for cases governed by the limitation
    periods set out in that Act.  Also see <i>Meady v. Greyhound Canada Transportation

    if the plaintiffs in any existing action can show special circumstances,
    the Lorraine Penna estate can be added as a party.  The only existing action
    appears to be the March 1, 2005 action launched by Langston, Sheriff and

    my view, this is not a case for application of the doctrine of special circumstances
    to permit adding the Lorraine Penna estate to the action as a defendant.  I
    begin with the chronology.  Lorraine Penna passed away on December 18, 2003.  She
    had been incompetent for some time before that, at least since October 1999,
    when Ernie Sheriff, Paul Penna’s nephew, replaced her as a director of Jakmin.  By
    March 2005, the solicitors for the estate were in possession of the first
    report from LECG forensic accountants, dated February 28, 2005, clearly indicating
    questionable transactions by Landen and resulting in a notice of action against
    Landen, his wife, and their company on March 1, 2005.  Wilton-Siegel J. issued
    a Mareva injunction freezing Landen’s assets the following day.  Langston,
    Sheriff and Jakmin issued the statement of claim on March 31, 2005.  There
    is no claim against the Lorraine Penna estate.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    April 20, 2005, at a meeting of counsel, the solicitor for the Lorraine Penna
    estate was informed of a possible claim.  Most of the charities that are
    now the respondents to this appeal were represented by counsel at this meeting.  This
    was followed up with a letter from counsel for several of the charities.  Almost
    eight months remained before expiration of the two year limitation period,
    but neither the Paul Penna estate nor the charities did anything to commence
    a claim against the Lorraine Penna estate.  They did not even invoke the
    procedure in s. 47 of the <i>Estates Act</i>, which would have stopped the
    s. 38(3) clock from running.  On December 21, 2005, three days after the
    limitation period under s. 38(3) expired, the charities applied to the court
    to remove Langston, Sheriff and Landen as executors of Paul Penna’s will
    and trustees of Paul Penna’s estate, and to substitute and replace them with
    representatives of several of the charities, representing 45 percent of the
    charitable beneficiaries of the estate.  Again, no action was taken against
    the Lorraine Penna estate.  LECG prepared a more comprehensive report for
    the estate on January 23, 2006, just over a month after expiration of the
    limitation period.  This report refers to some payments made by Landen for
    the care of Lorraine Penna.  Nothing was done to make a claim against the
    Lorraine Penna estate.  On April 7, 2006, the Lorraine Penna estate was added
    as a plaintiff to the March 1, 2005 action; nothing was done to add the estate
    as a defendant.  </p>

    is only almost a year after expiration of the limitation period on December
    4, 2006 that a claim is made against the Lorraine Penna estate in the motion
    for summary judgment.  The estate trustee during litigation of the estate
    of Paul Penna, Ronald C. Rutman, provided an affidavit in support of the
    motion for summary judgment.  That affidavit provides no explanation for
    the delay in commencing any action against the Lorraine Penna estate.  Moreover,
    Mr. Rutman appears to accept the statement contained in a response from Landen
    to the first LECG Report that “within a year and a half after Paul’s death
    [August 1996],
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    my view, the special circumstances doctrine should be applied with care when
    it is sought to add an estate as a defendant.  As Abella J.A. observed in <i>Waschkowski</i> at
    para. 9 the policy consideration underlying the clear time limit in s. 38(3)
    is to favour disposition of estate matters with finality.  The two year window
    makes access to a remedy “available for a limited time without creating indefinite
    fiscal vulnerability for an estate”.  In my view, there is an additional
    policy consideration: the difficulty an estate may have in defending against
    a stale claim.  This case provides an obvious example.  Not only is Lorraine
    Penna not around to defend herself, but it seems that from at least 1999
    she was incompetent.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    their factum, the respondents submit that special circumstances clearly exist
    and that there is no prejudice to the Lorraine Penna estate.  I disagree.  There
    is a presumption of prejudice that is exacerbated in this case by the incompetence
    of Lorraine Penna since 1999.  The respondents say that special circumstances
    exist by the fact that Landen, as co-executor of the Lorraine Penna estate,
    was well aware of the fraud at all relevant times.  But it is hardly a comfort
    to the estate that the fraudster was aware of his defalcation.  In any event,
    the respondents have an action against Landen.  The respondents also rely
    upon the notice the estate would have received from the March 2005 application
    for a Mareva Injunction, the April meeting, and the May letter.  However,
    the onus is on the respondents to establish special circumstances:  <i>Frohlick
    v. Pinkerton Canada Ltd.</i> (2008), 88 O.R. (3d) 401 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">

    against the estate at that time or at least invoke the s. 47 procedure.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

      Red Cross Society (Re)</i> (2002), 62 O.R. (3d) 227 (S.C.J.), Blair R.S.J.
      reviewed the application of the special circumstances doctrine in the context
      of s. 38(3), albeit where it was the estates that sought relief from the
      expiry of the two year limitation period (also see <i>Swain Estate</i>).  He
      referred at para. 23 to the statement in <i>Basarsky</i> at p.&nbsp;384
      that “the power to allow an amendment after the time limited by a Statute
      of Limitations will necessarily be infrequently invoked as the circumstances
      warranting its use will not often occur”.  In the end, at para. 25, Blair
      R.S.J. refused to apply the doctrine because there were no special or peculiar
      circumstances “other than those normally flowing from the individual injustice
      of a limitation period expiring”.  In my view, the same must be said here.  The
      respondents have had the advice of solicitors for a considerable time and
      were in possession of the relevant facts for many months before the limitation
      period expired.  Moreover, the injustice is attenuated here given that
      the real perpetrator of the fraud, his spouse and his company are parties
      to the actions, and that the respondents have not produced evidence to
      indicate that the Lorraine Penna estate received any proceeds of the fraud.</p>
