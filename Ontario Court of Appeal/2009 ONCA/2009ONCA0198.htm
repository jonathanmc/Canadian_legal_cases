    appeal concerns the interpretation and application of a statutory provision
    that, in certain circumstances, prohibits corporations from indemnifying
    officers and directors for the financial consequences of their regulatory
    offences.  It arises in an appeal by Bennett Environmental Inc. (BEI) from
    a March 4, 2008 order.  In that order, notwithstanding s. 124(3) of the <i>Canada
    Business Corporations Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-44 (the CBCA), the application
    judge required BEI to indemnify its former corporate director, John Anthony
    Bennett, for all costs, charges and expenses arising from certain civil and
    administrative proceedings, including proceedings under the <i>Securities
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.5.   </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>BEI,
    a company publicly traded on both the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto and American Stock Exchanges, is a federally incorporated company.  It
    carries on a business that includes the thermal remediation of contaminated
    soil.  Bennett, the founder of BEI’s predecessor company, was BEI’s Chief
    Executive Officer and a member of its two-person Disclosure Committee.  After
    Bennett resigned from both positions in February 2004, he was no longer involved
    in the details of management.  However, he served as chair of BEI’s Board
    of Directors until August 2004 and thereafter continued as a consultant to
    BEI.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    June 2003, BEI announced it had been awarded the largest soil remediation
    contract in its history, called the Phase III Contract (the Contract).  The
    Contract was executed with Sevenson Environmental Services Inc. (Sevenson),
    which acted as subcontractor for the United States Army Corps of Engineers
    (the Corps).  BEI had previously entered into and fulfilled similar contracts
    in the first two phases of the same soil remediation project.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    its announcement, BEI was notified in June 2003 that a competitor was protesting
    the award of the Contract to BEI. In August and September, 2003, BEI was
    notified that the Corps asserted a withdrawal of its consent to the award
    of the Contract to BEI and that the Corps was rebidding a contract (the Second
    Contract) through Sevenson for a much smaller volume of soil.  Nonetheless,
    in intervening press releases, BEI continued to list the Contract, including
    its large volume of soil remediation, as part of its inventory of projects.  In
    June 2004, BEI executed the Second Contract.  That month and the next, the
    Corps definitively took the position that the Contract was at an end and
    that the Second Contract was the only outstanding contract.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    July 2004, BEI issued a press release disclosing that further shipments under
    the Contract were “highly unlikely” and that it had been awarded the smaller
    Second Contract.  In the same press release, BEI disclosed that the status
    of the Contract had been in dispute since August 2003.  The price of BEI
    shares fell almost 50% within ten days.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    the dramatic loss in share value, class actions were brought in the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>
    against BEI and BEI directors.  As well, the U.S. Securities and Exchange
    Commission (the SEC) brought proceedings against BEI, Bennett, and other
    BEI directors. The class actions and SEC proceedings were ultimately settled
    in 2005 and 2006.    </p>
  <h3>The

    Ontario Securities Commission Proceedings</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition to the proceedings brought in the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">U.S.</st1:country-region>
    , the staff of the Ontario Securities Commission (the OSC) also made allegations
    against BEI, Bennett, and other BEI directors, which included alleged violations
    of the disclosure requirements under the <i>Securities Act</i>.  The OSC
    later abandoned an allegation that Bennett had provided misleading evidence
    during its investigation. There was no allegation of insider trading against
    Bennett, although his successor at BEI admitted to that offence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    2006, the OSC approved a settlement agreement between its staff and Bennett.  In
    that agreement, Bennett admitted that, at the time it arose, the existence
    of the dispute about the Contract constituted a “material change” within
    the meaning of the <i>Securities Act</i> and that BEI had failed to disclose
    that change, contrary to s. 75 of the <i>Securities Act</i> and the public
    interest.  In view of that admission, Bennett acknowledged
    “serious misconduct” in the violation of s. 122(1)(b) and s. 122(3) of the <i>Securities
    Act.  </i>At the same time, the settlement agreement expressly acknowledged
    that Bennett had had an honest but mistaken belief that, despite the dispute,
    the Contract was enforceable and the dispute would ultimately be resolved
    in favour of BEI.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    accordance with the terms of the settlement agreement, the OSC prohibited
    Bennett from acting as an officer or director for a period of ten years,
    issued a reprimand, and ordered him to pay an administrative fine of $250,000,
    as well as $50,000 toward the cost of the OSC investigation.  BEI was not
    ordered to pay any penalty.</p>
  <h3>The Indemnification Proceedings</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    December 2006, Bennett sought indemnification from BEI for both the fine
    and the costs he had incurred in the OSC proceedings. However, BEI not only
    refused Bennett&rsquo;s request for OSC-related indemnification, but it also
    sought repayment of monies it had already advanced to indemnify Bennett in
    relation to the U.S. class action and the costs of the SEC proceedings. The
    minutes of BEI&rsquo;s Board meeting reflect this decision and refer to the
    prohibition against indemnification contained in its by-law as well as &ldquo;limited
    cash resources&rdquo; from which to indemnify Bennett. In response, Bennett
    brought an application for a declaration that he was entitled to indemnification
    in relation to all the proceedings. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    124(1) of the CBCA permits indemnification of a director or officer by the
    corporation for all costs, charges, or expenses incurred “<span style='color:black'>in
    respect of any civil, criminal, administrative, investigative or other proceeding
    in which the individual is involved because of that association with the
    corporation”</span>.  BEI’s General By-law No. 1, on the other hand, mandates
    indemnification.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    s. 124(3) of the CBCA and BEI’s by-law, which echoes the wording of s. 124(3),
    prohibit indemnification where the director or officer has not complied with
    certain requirements.  The non-indemnification provisions of ss. 124(3)(a)
    and (b) of the CBCA contain two components, which are sometimes referred
    to as the “good faith and lawful conduct requirements”:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>A corporation may not indemnify an individual</i> under
    subsection (1) <i>unless the individual</i></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a) <i>acted honestly and in good faith with
      a view to the best interests of the corporation</i>, or, as the case may
      be, to the best interests of the other entity for which the individual
      acted as director or officer or in a similar capacity at the corporation’s
      request; <i>and</i></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(b) <i>in the case of a</i> criminal or <i>administrative
      action or proceeding that is enforced by a monetary penalty, the individual
      had reasonable grounds for believing that the individual’s conduct was
      lawful. </i>[Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his affidavits in support of his application for indemnification, and in
    his cross-examination on those affidavits, Bennett attested that he did not
    consider the Contract to be in jeopardy.  He also attested that he did not
    take seriously the Corps’ notification in the summer and fall of 2003 that
    it was withdrawing its consent to the Contract.  In Bennett’s view, the Corps
    was only stating this position to placate the competitor who had protested
    the award of the Contract to BEI.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Bennett
    held this view because he considered such protests were standard and to be
    expected in the industry.  Bennett was certain that the Contract remained
    extant because, from his extensive experience in the industry, he knew that
    BEI was the only company that could fulfill the Contract, BEI had been the
    successful bidder for Phases I and II of the project, and both BEI’s U.S.
    representative and Sevenson’s representative had assured BEI and Bennett
    that the Contract remained binding.  Even when the Corps spoke of tendering
    a Second Contract, which Bennett believed would be for soil additional to
    the outstanding Contract, Bennett believed that this again was only done
    to placate the competitor.  BEI and Bennett turned out to be wrong.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    evidence of the sincerity of his belief at the time in the binding nature
    of the Contract, Bennett pointed out that he had received his October 2003
    bonus in the form of stock options instead of cash.  In addition, against
    the advice of his financial adviser, he had refused to sell any BEI stock
    during the relevant period.  This conduct, he argued, belied any director
    misconduct on his part.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>BEI,
    on the other hand, asserted that Bennett had not held his belief honestly
    and, even if he had, that such a belief was unreasonable.  Moreover, BEI
    took the position that Bennett could not have acted in good faith, or have
    had reasonable grounds for his belief, when he did not consult with legal
    counsel. Accordingly, BEI argued that it was prohibited by both its by-law
    and s. 124(3) of the CBCA from indemnifying Bennett.</p>
  <h3>The Application Judge’s Reasons </h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge noted Bennett’s position and BEI’s argument that Bennett
    had not fulfilled either requirement of s. 124(3).  He also recognized BEI’s
    view that a person in Bennett’s position, who considered all the available
    information, would or should have known that BEI was required to disclose
    the Contract dispute, and that Bennett’s position to the contrary was “untenable”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
class=neutralcitation><span>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span><span class=neutralcitation>T</span>he
    application judge described the proceeding as raising the issue of whether
    the director seeking indemnification or the company opposing indemnification
    bears the onus of establishing the presence or absence of the director’s “honesty,
    good faith and belief in lawful conduct”.  He quoted both prongs of the s.
    124(3) requirement for indemnification.  He determined that the onus fell
    on BEI to demonstrate that Bennett did not satisfy the requirements of s.
    124(3) and<span
class=neutralcitation> that the correct test is reflected by asking the following
    question:  “what would have been done by a reasonable person in the circumstances
    by a person acting as a director who possessed the skill, training and experience
    of the individual in question?”  The application judge also recognized that
    a reasonable director is “not entitled to rely on an unreasonable subjective
    belief.”  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
class=neutralcitation><span>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>Since BEI
    had failed to establish that Bennett had acted <span class=neutralcitation>“in
    bad faith or unlawfully”,</span> or that his belief in the lawfulness of
    his conduct was “unfounded or totally unreasonable<span class=neutralcitation>”,
    and since</span> there was “no conclusive objective evidence” on which “to
    conclude that Bennett should not be believed on his version of the events”,
    t<span

    challenges both the application judge’s interpretation and application of
    the appropriate tests required by s. 124(3) as well as his factual findings.  BEI
    also argues that indemnification in the circumstances of this case is inconsistent
    with the policy rationale underlying s. 124. </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    agree that questions of law are to be reviewed on the standard of correctness,
    questions of fact and factual inference on the standard of palpable and overriding
    error, and questions of mixed fact and law, generally speaking, on a spectrum
    between the other two standards, dependent on whether the alleged error is
    closer to an error of law or one of fact.</p>
  <h3>The Policy Rationale </h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    interpreting the relevant provisions, I begin with the legislative rationale
    for permitting indemnification generally, while prohibiting it in specified
    circumstances.  The primary purpose of indemnification is to provide assurance
    to those prepared to become corporate directors that they will be recompensed
    for any adverse consequences arising from well-intentioned entrepreneurism
    undertaken on the corporation’s behalf.  This assurance serves to attract
    and to protect competent directors who will advance the interests of the
    corporation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    to encourage appropriate conduct, Parliament and the provincial legislatures
    also provide deterrents against misconduct.  Arguably, the most effective
    deterrent is the consequence, including the stigma, of director prosecution
    and conviction.  Another deterrent is the legislative prohibition against
    corporate indemnification for director misconduct.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    tension between the competing objectives of encouraging director entrepreneurism
    on the one hand, and discouraging director misconduct on the other, informs
    the interpretation of s. 124(3). </p>
  <h3>The Onus and the Test</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From
    the perspective of these competing objectives, I turn to the wording of s.
    124(3) of the CBCA.  Section 124(3) requires a consideration of the particular
    context in which the individual acted. Subsection 124(3)(a) sets out, as
    a pre-condition to indemnification, that the individual must have acted honestly
    and in good faith in the best interests of the corporation.  Section 124(3)(b)
    adds an additional prerequisite regarding indemnification arising from criminal
    or regulatory penalties: the individual must also have had reasonable grounds
    for believing his or her conduct was lawful.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
class=hit1><span style='color:windowtext;font-weight:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></span>In
    keeping with the contextual perspective, Parliament determined that entitlement
    to indemnification must be decided on the basis of the circumstances that
    existed at the time of the director’s (a) conduct and (b) belief.  This is
    clear not only from the wording of s. 124(3), but also from the leading case
    of <i>Blair v. Consolidated Enfield Corp.</i>, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 5, where Iacobucci
    J. observed, at para. 74, that <span
style='color:black'>the similar non-indemnification provision in the <i>Business
    Corporations Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. B.16, allows “for reimbursement for
    reasonable good faith behaviour, thereby discouraging the hindsight application
    of <a name="HIT_2"></a><a
name="ORIGHIT_2"></a><span class=hit1><span style='color:black;font-weight:

style='color:black'>  </span></span></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=hit1><span style='color:black;font-weight:normal;'>In
        addressing the required degree of misconduct, </span></span>Iacobucci
        J. instructed, at para. 74, that indemnification will only be prohibited
        if the director acted with <i>mala fides</i>.  At para. 35, he cited <i>General
        Motors of Canada Ltd. v. Brunet</i>, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 537, at p. 548,
        for the proposition that “persons are assumed to act in good faith unless
        proven otherwise” and placed the onus of proving<i> mala fides</i> on
        the corporation opposing indemnification.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Noting
    that this interpretation of s. 124(3)(a) is in keeping with academic commentary,
    Iacobucci J. quoted, at para. 74, from Jacob S. Ziegel <i>et al.</i>, <i>Cases
    and Materials on Partnerships and Canadian Business Corporations,</i> 3d
    ed., vol. 1 (Scarborough, Ont.: 1994), at p. 523. There, the authors acknowledge
    the appropriateness of denying indemnification for “fraud or misappropriation”,
    but recognize that a director should not be denied indemnification if the “conduct … was
    not coloured by any opportunistic behaviour”.  Opportunistic or self-seeking
    behaviour may be encompassed within the term <i>mala fides</i> because such
    behaviour exhibits a type of dishonesty that should not be countenanced by
    an award for indemnification.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    scope of the bad faith described in <i>Blair</i> was clarified in <i>Enterprises
    Sibeca Inc. v. Frelighsburg (Municipality)</i>, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 304. At para.
    25, Deschamps J., writing for the court and citing <span class=italic1><span style='color:black'>Finney
    v. Barreau du Québec</span></span><span style='color:black'>, [2004] 2 S.C.R.
    17</span> at para. 39, accepted that bad faith can encompass recklessness
    in the sense that the conduct at issue is so inexplicable that it suggests
    an absence of good faith.  Deschamps J. also noted, at para. 26, that this
    clarification means “no more than the admission in evidence of facts that
    amount to circumstantial evidence of bad faith where a victim is unable to
    present direct evidence of it.”  Thus, inexplicable, apparently reckless,
    conduct may lead to the inference that the conduct was deliberate, intentional
    and undertaken in bad faith.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since<i> </i>the
    dispute<i> </i>in <i>Blair </i>involved a director’s indemnification for
    a civil proxy dispute, it did not expressly consider the second branch of
    the CBCA’s non-indemnification test under s. 124(3)(b), which requires reasonable
    grounds for belief in lawful conduct. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless,
    in my view, for reasons analogous to the observation in <i>Blair</i> regarding
    honest and good faith conduct, the corporation also bears the burden of showing
    that the director did not have reasonable grounds for his or her belief that
    the conduct was lawful.  Placing the burden on the corporation is consistent
    with the principle affirmed in <i>Blair</i> regarding s. 124(3)(a) that persons
    are assumed to act in good faith.  In my view, under s. 124(3)(b), persons
    should also be assumed to believe they are acting lawfully and to have reasonable
    grounds for that belief, unless the contrary is proven.  There is no indication
    in the wording of the legislation that suggests a different burden should
    be imposed for (b) than for (a).  <span style='color:black'>The imposition
    of the burden on the corporation best </span><span class=hit1><span
style='color:black;font-weight:normal;'>balances the promotion of strong director
    decision-making, on the one hand, while discouraging irresponsible behaviour
    on the other.  </span></span>Finally, as a practical matter, this placement
    of the  burden makes sense because the corporation, and not the individual
    director, will most likely have the advantage of unrestricted access to corporate
    documents relevant to the indemnification proceeding.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Relying
    on <span class=Prompt><i>Catalyst Fund General Partner I Inc. v. Hollinger
    Inc</i></span><span class=Prompt>. </span>(2006), 79 O.R. (3d) 288, BEI submits
    that an objective test must be applied in determining whether Bennett satisfied
    s. 124(3)(a) and that the application judge erred in applying a subjective
    standard.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Catalyst</i>, Cronk
    J.A., writing for the panel, determined, at para. 105, that a director was
    not entitled to indemnification under s. 124(3) because the significance
    of the changed circumstances “would have been apparent to even the most untrained
    observer”.  Thus, she concluded, at para. 106, the director “cannot make
    out a claim for indemnification by relying on an unreasonable subjective
    belief.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, <i>Catalyst </i>rightly concluded that a director cannot ground
    a claim for indemnification on an unreasonable belief where that belief would
    have been obviously erroneous to even the most untrained observer.  Such
    a belief would be analogous to the reasoning in <i>Enterprises </i>that observed
    that a director cannot rely on recklessness to defend otherwise indefensible
    conduct.  Thus, the conclusion in <i>Catalyst</i> reflects the finding that
    the director’s evidence regarding his good faith was not credible in the
    circumstances of that case.  Accordingly, I do not accept the appellant’s
    submission that <i>Catalyst </i>changed the test from that set out in <i>Blair</i>,
    as clarified in <i>Enterprises</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Indeed,
    the <i>Blair</i> reasonableness test achieves the same result by asking whether
    the director acted reasonably when the director’s conduct or belief is considered
    in the context of the perspective of a director in comparable circumstances
    at the time.  Looking at comparable circumstances involves looking at the
    issue from the perspective of the knowledge and skill set of the individual
    director and the information and advice upon which the director’s conduct
    or belief was based.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    wording employed by Parliament in both s. 124(3)(a) and (b) supports this
    interpretation of the reasonableness test.  That wording instructs that the
    question is whether “the individual” exhibited good faith conduct and had
    reasonable grounds for believing that his or her conduct was lawful.  The
    answer must include consideration of the context in which the director decided
    on the conduct or formed the belief at issue.  It is implicit in the wording
    that the conduct or belief at issue must have been reasonable when considered
    in context.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    turn to the application of the test to the circumstances of this case, an
    issue that I approach mindful of the factual findings made by the application
    judge. </p>
  <h3>Application of the test</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    admitting to breaches of s. 122(1)(b) and s. 122(3) of the <i>Securities
    Act</i>, Bennett acknowledged to the OSC that, at the time, the Contract
    dispute was a material change that BEI was obliged to disclose.  However,
    BEI acknowledges that this admission does not, in itself, preclude Bennett’s
    indemnification.  Otherwise, there would be no point in the CBCA’s provision
    of director indemnification for such administrative penalties.  Moreover,
    the onus and test regarding an offence under the <i>Securities Act</i> differ
    from the onus and test mandated by the non-indemnification provisions of
    the CBCA.  Thus, while Bennett’s admissions to the OSC may reflect on the
    credibility of his evidence before the application judge, the OSC findings
    do not predetermine the result of the indemnification application.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    before the OSC and on his application, Bennett attested that, in the light
    of all the circumstances, he mistakenly believed the Contract dispute would
    be resolved in BEI’s favour and so he did not consider the ongoing developments
    to be a change in the binding nature of the Contract, let alone a material
    one. For this reason, he did not identify any obligation to disclose.  Thus,
    he argues, he acted honestly in BEI’s interests and that he believed his
    conduct was lawful.  Further, he asserts there is no basis on which to conclude
    his belief or conduct was reckless or that his view would have been obviously
    erroneous to even the most untrained observer at the time.  </p>
  <h3>Section 124(3)(a) </h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under
    s. 124(3)(a), the issue for the application judge was whether BEI had established
    that Bennett was not credible in his evidence that he had “acted honestly
    and in good faith with a view to the best interests of the corporation”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the application judge was alive to BEI’s position that Bennett was lying
    about his good faith conduct (or that he acted unreasonably), he concluded
    that BEI had failed to satisfy its onus to disprove Bennett’s evidence.  BEI
    argues that the application judge erred in so concluding.  I do not agree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    undoubtedly the obligation to disclose a material change is absolute, it
    is not always clear at the time that an event, or even a series of events,
    constitutes a material change.  Such a determination may turn on an assessment
    of the reliability of the available information.  In this case, Bennett gave
    reasons why he did not take the developing information seriously at the time.  Those
    reasons included the assurances about the Contract Bennett received from
    BEI’s own U.S. representative and from Sevenson’s representative.  Bennett
    also had regular discussions about the Contract with another director who
    was a lawyer.  In addition, Bennett had discussions with his fellow director
    on the Disclosure Committee, albeit those discussions were not couched in
    terms of any disclosure obligations since he did not consider the developments
    to constitute a material change.  Bennett’s evidence was further supported
    by his open discussions with other officers and directors at BEI and the
    candid discussions with the Board about the dispute.  In other words, Bennett’s
    belief was an informed one.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore,
    the honesty of Bennett’s belief was supported by the absence of any motive
    to withhold disclosure.  Indeed, Bennett pressed the BEI Board to proceed
    with the development of a new plant that would only have been required to
    honour the Contract.  Bennett would not likely have done so if he believed
    the Contract was in jeopardy.  Moreover, unlike others involved in BEI, Bennett
    did not stand to gain personally from the non-disclosure.  This is also evident
    from Bennett’s election to take his bonus in options and from his decision
    not to sell any BEI stock. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
    on this evidence, the application judge concluded that he was not able to
    reject Bennett&rsquo;s position. From reading the application judge&rsquo;s
    reasons as a whole, it is clear that BEI failed to establish that Bennett&rsquo;s
    stated belief was either opportunistic or amounted to a reckless disregard
    of his obligations. The application judge specifically observed the absence
    of &ldquo;conclusive objective evidence on which to make such a finding.&rdquo;  He
    considered and applied Iacobucci J.&rsquo;s reasoning at para. 76 of <i>Blair</i>: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is insufficient to say retrospectively that
    Blair &lsquo;should have&rsquo; acted differently or that he did not handle
    things perfectly in order to deny indemnification under s. 136(1).  Actual <i>mala fides</i> must
    be shown such that the director did not act with a view to the best interests
    of the corporation.”  </p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>Similarly, it is not enough in this
    case to say, with the benefit of hindsight, that Bennett should have done
    more. The application judge accordingly was entitled to conclude that BEI
  had not satisfied the burden of establishing that Bennett acted in bad faith.</p>
  <h3>Section 124(3)(b) </h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge did not expressly separate his consideration of the s. 124(3)(b)
    requirement that Bennett had reasonable grounds to believe that non-disclosure
    was lawful from his s. 124(3)(a) analysis.  The two requirements are distinct:  see <i>Peoples
    Department Stores Inc. (Trustee of) v. Wise, </i>[2004] 3 S.C.R. 461, at
    para. 33, where Major and Deschamps JJ. discuss this distinction in the context
    of the different duties of directors under s. 122(1) of the CBCA.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless,
    the application judge’s reasons demonstrate that he was alive to the distinction
    between s. 124(3)(a) and (b).  On more than one occasion, he referred to “belief
    in lawful conduct” as a requirement that was in addition to the requirement
    of honesty and good faith.  Moreover, in the particular circumstances of
    this case, it is apparent that the facts and the evidence underpinning both
    branches of the test, to a certain extent, are intertwined, as are the arguments
    advanced by the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One
    of BEI’s arguments, which applies to both branches of the test, is that Bennett
    could not possibly have had reasonable grounds to believe that his conduct
    was lawful (or that he was acting in good faith) when he did not consult
    legal counsel.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    issue arose in <i>Blair</i> where, unlike in this case, the director seeking
    indemnification relied on the fact that he had consulted counsel before proceeding
    with the impugned conduct as evidence that he had acted in good faith,  In
    upholding an order for indemnification, Iacobucci J. explained, at paras.
    58 and 65, that, while a director’s <i>de facto</i> reliance on legal advice
    does not guarantee indemnification, reliance on counsel’s advice “will strongly
    militate <u>against</u> a finding of <i>mala fides</i> or fiduciary breach” (emphasis
    in original).  The court in <i>Blair</i> relied on several additional considerations
    in ultimately concluding that the director was entitled to indemnification.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, while reliance on reasonable legal or professional advice will substantially
    assist a director seeking indemnification in establishing reasonable grounds
    for belief that his or her conduct is lawful, such consultation is not a
    prerequisite to indemnification.  Rather, the variety of additional considerations
    that may come into play in a particular case makes it both undesirable and
    unnecessary to promulgate an inflexible rule mandating legal advice as a
    prerequisite to indemnification under either branch of s. 124(3).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    said, however, a failure to obtain professional advice may raise questions
    in a particular case about a director’s conduct or belief.  In such a case,
    it may be necessary to assess the surrounding circumstances and conduct of
    the director at the relevant time to look for other evidence of the reasonableness
    of the relied-upon belief.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, Bennett testified that he did not turn his mind to the issue of
    disclosure or seek legal advice because it simply did not occur to him to
    do so, in part, because he was an engineer and not a lawyer.  Standing on
    its own, this explanation cannot constitute reasonable grounds under s. 124(3)(b).  A
    director serving on a Disclosure Committee, lawyer or not, is expected to
    have at least a basic familiarity with disclosure obligations.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    this was not a case where Bennett recognized and wilfully ignored an evident
    disclosure obligation or failed to make reasonable inquiries.  To the contrary,
    as detailed above, the evidence shows that Bennett sought information from
    BEI’s
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      U.S.</st1:country-region>
    representative and from Sevenson’s representative. He also had discussions
    with other directors and officers in the company.  While Bennett was subsequently
    proven wrong in his decision not to make earlier disclosure, BEI failed to
    demonstrate that, from the perspective of someone in Bennett’s position at
    the time, Bennett did not have reasonable grounds for believing he was acting
    lawfully.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the application judge’s reasons are couched in terms of Bennett’s belief
    in the continued validity of the Contract, rather than in terms of his belief
    that he did not have disclosure obligations, in the circumstances of this
    case, the two beliefs are synonymous. If Bennett honestly and reasonably
    believed the Contract was not in jeopardy, and that it accordingly remained
    a binding contract, there was no basis upon which he ought to have believed
    that he was obliged to make disclosure of a material change.  I see no error
    of law in the application judge’s reasons and therefore no basis to interfere
    with his conclusions in this regard. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly,
    I conclude that it was open to the application judge to determine that BEI
    did not meet the onus on it to establish that Bennett did not have reasonable
    grounds to believe his conduct was lawful.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    I note that this is not a case that invokes the business judgment rule <span> </span>discussed
    in <i>Kerr v. Danier Leather In<span
class=Prompt>c</span></i>., [2007] 3 S.C.R. 331.  In <i>Kerr</i>, Binnie J. instructed,
    at para. 54, that the business judgment rule “is a concept well-developed
    in the context of <i>business </i>decisions but should not be used to qualify
    or undermine the duty of disclosure” under the <i>Securities Act</i> (emphasis
    in original) <span> </span>Accordingly, the test to be met in this case is
    that set out in s. 124(3) of the CBCA.  </p>
  <h3>Other errors</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>BEI
    also submits that the application judge made factual errors.  I reject this
    ground of appeal.  To the extent that BEI argues that the application judge
    was obliged to refuse indemnification in the light of the factual findings
    of the OSC, I disagree.  I have already given my view that the different
    burden and test under the <i>Securities Act</i> and the CBCA may result in
    different outcomes.  I also disagree with BEI’s characterization of the application
    judge’s reasons as requiring expert or other evidence to refute Bennett’s
    evidence.  While this issue is more a question of law than of fact, in my
    view, the application judge’s excerpted reasons do no more than reinforce
    his already-stated view that the evidence led by BEI was insufficient to
    meet the requisite onus under either branch of the s. 124(3) test.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    BEI observes that the OSC specifically declined to impose a penalty on BEI
    on the basis that such a penalty would ultimately be borne by the shareholders.  From
    this, the appellant argues that granting Bennett indemnification in this
    application would impose the financial burden on the shareholders, contrary
    to the OSC’s intention.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, BEI’s argument is answered in two ways.  First, while the argument
    is premised on the assumption that Bennett’s conduct was sufficiently egregious
    to deny him indemnification, the application judge concluded that BEI failed
    to prove such misconduct and, as I have already stated, I see no reason to
    interfere with his conclusion.  Second, BEI chose to protect directors against
    the imposition of financial penalties by enacting a by-law providing for
    director indemnification except in the case of misconduct.  Again, as found
    by the application judge, BEI has failed to prove such misconduct.</p>

    the result, I would dismiss the appeal.  I would also award costs to Bennett
    fixed at $14,000, inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>

    generally, and restricts it in specified circumstances.  Indeed, most of
    the provincial indemnification provisions prescribe the identical good faith
    and lawful conduct requirements set out in the CBCA (New Brunswick, Newfoundland,
    Ontario, Manitoba, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and British Columbia), and others
    deny indemnification where the charges, expenses, or liability were occasioned
