  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, the appellants succeeded in obtaining a judgment for damages against
    two respondents, C.R. and Y.T., for inflicting a serious assault on the appellant
    J.D. They also obtained judgment against the respondent N.R. for a small
    portion of those damages. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants raise a number of grounds of appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for the appellants focussed his primary attack on the trial judge’s dismissal
    of the action against the respondent N.O. because the appellants did not
    establish that N.O. provided the directions to J.D.’s house to the respondents
    that permitted them to inflict the assault. Counsel argued that the trial
    judge erred, because he should have rejected the evidence that N.O. did not
    provide any directions, but rather should have accepted the evidence leading
    to the opposite conclusion. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    argument cannot succeed. This court is not permitted to retry the case in
    this way, as counsel would have us do. It should be well understood that
    we are limited to determining if the trial judge’s findings of fact exhibit
    palpable and overriding error, a high standard for the appellants to meet.
    Trial judges are simply in the best position to determine which evidence
    to accept and which to reject.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, there was ample evidence to support the finding that N.O. was
    not shown to have given the directions alleged by the appellants. N.O. denied
    giving those directions, and it was clearly open to the trial judge to accept
    this evidence, whatever he may have thought of other parts of her testimony.
    The phone records showed that the only occasions on which the directions
    could have been given were in two phone calls made not to N.O.’s phone, but
    to the home of N.R., and there was no evidence that N.O. was at N.R.’s house
    at the time. The trial judge declined to accept the evidence that would lead
    to the conclusion that N.O. did give the directions. Counsel’s view that
    this was the better evidence and should have been preferred is an argument
    to be made at trial, not an argument which can succeed in this court, because
    we are not empowered to retry the case. This ground of appeal fails.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Linked
    to this issue was counsel’s argument that he should have been permitted,
    after reasons for judgment were issued, to reopen the case to call N.R. However,
    N.R. was available to be called at trial. Moreover, counsel’s material in
    support of his motion before the trial judge acknowledged that N.R.’s evidence
    would not show that N.O. was part of the two critical calls, but only that
    N.R. was not. The trial judge dismissed the motion, finding that the proposed
    evidence would not change his conclusion that the appellants had not shown
    N.O. to have given the directions. In light of counsel’s acknowledgement,
    this conclusion is unanswerable. This ground of appeal also fails.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel’s
    third main argument on the appeal was that the trial judge erred in dismissing
    the action against L.K., who drove the assailants to the neighbourhood where
    J.D. lived, and later drove them home. Again counsel is faced with findings
    of fact that cannot be overcome. There was ample evidence that L.K. knew
    nothing about any plan to assault J.D. when he dropped the assailants off,
    nor, when he drove them home, that there had been a serious assault, and
    that he found out about it only several days later. Counsel’s argument is
    that despite this evidence, it is inconceivable that L.K. did not know, because
    of the close confines of the car. That is, the trial judge should have disbelieved
    the evidence that L.K. knew nothing. Once again, this court is not empowered
    to act on such an argument, as indeed counsel appeared to acknowledge. This
    ground of appeal also fails. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    also made brief submissions about the aggravated damages and <i>Family Law
    Act</i> damages that were awarded. He asserts little more than that the amounts
    were too low. That is not enough to succeed on appeal. The trial judge exercised
    his discretion and made an assessment, as he was required to. There is no
    basis for this court to interfere. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    was also argued that punitive damages should have been awarded, and that
    deterrence required more than what has been meted out by the criminal justice
    system. The trial judge did not agree, and dismissed this claim. Once again,
    that was a decision for him. Counsel’s view that he ought not to have found
    that deterrence had been inadequately addressed is not a basis upon which
    this court can interfere.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    also made brief submissions that a new trial should have been directed because
    of several remarks made in chambers by the trial judge that were said to
    reflect bias and to have informed the outcome of the trial. We disagree on
    both counts. A reasonable, fully informed person would not conclude that
    the trial judge had closed his mind to the appellants’
    case. Nor did counsel apparently think so at the time since he took no steps
    to have the trial judge removed. Nor is there any basis whatsoever to find
    that these remarks (if they were ever made) inform the outcome of the trial.
    This argument fails.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    did not pursue several other issues raised in the appellants’ factum and
    we need not address them here. Indeed, we did not call on the respondents
    to address any of the appellants’ arguments save those related to costs of
    the trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge awarded costs to the appellants on a partial indemnity basis
    rather than the substantial indemnity basis claim. He was entirely within
    his discretion in doing so, and we would not interfere. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants also appeal the trial judge’s refusal to make a Bullock<i> </i>or
    Sanderson order with respect to the costs of the successful defendants. Counsel
    takes issue with the trial judge’s view that on the information available
    prior to trial it was not reasonable to continue the action against N.O.
    or L.K. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    was a conclusion that the trial judge could easily and properly reach. The
    appellants had major evidentiary hurdles to overcome with both defendants – hurdles
    that were well understood before the trial. Moreover, as the trial judge
    said, the order sought would likely mean that these successful defendants
    would never collect their costs against the respondents who committed the
    assault. It is not unfair for the appellants to pay their costs, since the
    appellants forced them to incur those costs and did not succeed against them. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    recognize that the end result will likely leave the appellants unable to
    recover their judgment or their costs but require them to pay costs to the
    successful defendants despite the serious assault of J.D. However that possibility
    was clearly foreseeable from very early on in this lawsuit and yet it was
    proceeded with.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
