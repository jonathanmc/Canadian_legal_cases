    40 years ago, on August 9, 1967, Leopold Roy, a 20-year veteran of the Ottawa
    Fire Department, was stabbed to death in an Ottawa apartment building. His
    wife, Mildred Roy, saw the assailant and provided the police with a description.  On
    August 10, Detective John McCombie of the Ottawa Police Department showed
    Mrs. Roy photographs of ten different men, including pictures of the appellant,
    Romeo Phillion, and his identical twin brother, Donald. Mrs. Roy picked Donald
    as the person she thought most resembled the attacker. </p>

    police learned that the Phillion brothers were in New Liskeard, Ontario.
    On the evening of August 12, 1967, Detective McCombie travelled there with
    his partner, Detective Edward Coburn. They eliminated Donald as a suspect
    after confirming that he had been at work in a New Liskeard auto garage on
    August 9, 1967.  </p>

    Ottawa to participate in a line-up before Mrs.&nbsp;Roy, which took place
    on August 15. While Mrs. Roy was in the viewing room, she identified the
    appellant as the perpetrator. However, when she was taken into the line-up
    room, she stated that the appellant looked like the man who killed her husband,
    but she was not sure.  In the absence of a positive identification, the appellant
    was released. </p>

    and the murder weapon was never found.  Mrs. Roy identified three other men
    as suspects. All three were arrested and later released.</p>

    concerning the non-disclosure of an alibi for the appellant, as described
    in a police report of the lead investigating officer, Detective McCombie,
    as well as the non-disclosure of certain witness statements.  The second

    terms of reference go on to provide that if this court determines that the

    is to decide the case as if it were an appeal on the basis of fresh evidence.</p>

line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    reasons that follow, I would admit the new information concerning the non-disclosure
    of an alibi for the appellant and the non-disclosure of certain witness statements.
    I would not admit the recent expert reports concerning the reliability of
    the appellant’s confession.  On the issue of remedy, I would allow the appeal,
    quash the conviction and order a new trial. </p>

    the factual background for this Reference, including the evidence that was
    heard by the jury at trial regarding Mr. Roy’s murder and the appellant’s
    alleged involvement in it, the theory of the Crown and the defence at trial,
    the nature of the appeal proceedings to this court and the Supreme Court
    of Canada, the events leading up to the ordering of the Reference and the
    terms of this Reference as specified by the Minister. </p>
  <p><b>The Evidence at Trial Regarding the Murder and the Appellant’s Confessions</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    evidence heard by the jury at the appellant’s trial regarding the details
    of Mr.&nbsp;Roy’s murder is succinctly stated by Ritchie J. in the majority
    judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. Phillion</i>, [1978]
    1 S.C.R. 18, at pp. 21-22:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The murdered
    man, Léopold Roy, was the superintendent of an apartment house at 275 Friel
    Street in Ottawa and was also employed by the City of Ottawa as a fireman.
    In the afternoon of August 9, 1967, his wife, who had been engaged in housework
    in the apartment house, observed a suspicious man lurking in the corridor
    and, as she thought, attempting to enter one of the apartments. She noticed
    that the man was holding an alligator wallet which raised her suspicion and
    she called out to her husband who was working in the basement. The prowler
    appeared to be nervous and didn’t move, but when she called out to her husband
    a second time and could hear him coming upstairs, the man ran through the
    hallway to the back stairs, jumped over the railings to the landing and Mr.
    Roy caught him and shoved him back into a corner and called out to his wife “You
    know what to do”. Mrs. Roy then went down to her apartment and left her husband
    holding the man on the stairway. The next thing she heard was a call from
    her husband saying:
    “Don’t call the police, call a doctor”.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The next person
    to see Roy was Mr. Herbert, the oil burner serviceman who had come to clean
    the furnace and who had been talking to Roy when his wife first called out
    to him. After finishing his work this man found Roy lying on the basement
    stairs covered with blood and with a knife wound immediately below his heart.
    Herbert went outside to his truck and radioed his company to send the police
    but Roy was dead by the time the first policeman arrived.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Shortly after
    these events, Mrs. Roy, who had seen the prowler’s face three times, made
    several attempts to identify him in “line-ups” where the appellant was present
    and in photographs, but she was unable to make any positive identification
    and the appellant was released.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    jury also heard that some four years after the appellant’s initial arrest
    and subsequent release in August 1967, the appellant was brought into the
    Ottawa police station for questioning on January 11, 1972 on an unrelated
    matter (the jury did not hear that the appellant was brought into the station
    because he had been arrested on a charge of armed robbery). He was interviewed
    by Detectives Stephen Nadori and Roland Huneault.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his evidence in chief, Detective Huneault described an exchange with the
    appellant on the way to the cell area, in which the detective asked the appellant
    if he had anything else to tell them. In response, the appellant asked the
    detective what Neil Miller (the appellant’s lover) had told them. Detective
    Huneault responded that Miller had told the police “a lot about the things
    you bragged about to him”, following which the appellant asked if Miller
    had told them anything big.  When Detective Huneault indicated that he had,
    the appellant said, “I’ll confess”.  Detective Huneault asked him what he
    meant and he said, “Something big, like murder; the fireman, I did it.  Get
    me a coffee and we’ll talk about it.”  Detective Huneault testified that
    he had not taken any part in the investigation of Mr. Roy’s murder up to
    that time and that he was not thinking of the murder when he posed these
    questions to the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    Detective Huneault read the standard police caution and returned with the
    requested coffee, the appellant told the detective that he “did the murder
    of the fireman a long time ago on Friel Street.”  The appellant said he would
    make a full confession after he had spoken to Miller.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    police then went to Neil Miller’s home and asked him to come to the police
    station. He agreed and the police obtained a signed statement from him, which
    stated that on January 7, 1972, the appellant had told him that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>…he went into
    some apartment building, to steal some money, that there was supposed to
    be a lot of money hidden under a bed, that the Superintendent or the landlord,
    he believed had called the Police and that he had to get out of the building,
    that as he was rushing down the stairs, the Superintendent, a Fireman was
    coming up, and that he plunged the knife into this guy, and then he rushed
    out to the car…</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    being permitted by police to meet with Miller, the appellant provided a signed
    confession to the murder.  Before providing the statement he asked, “Was
    that guy a fireman or a policeman?  I can’t hang for that, can I?” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s typewritten, signed statement reads in part as follows:<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>…then I drove
    around, looking for an apartment that I could go into, to steal. I got into
    one apartment on Friel Street, looked around inside, in which I did not find
    any money. I had taken a knife from the kitchen of that apartment, going
    down the back stairs, I noticed a man and a woman. The man started coming
    down at me. I stabbed him. From there I ran to my car, that was parked on
    Nelson Street…Around 11:30 that night I drove to Trenton Ontario.  The next
    day I went to Toronto and then to New Liskeard Ontario.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'>His written
    statement also indicates that in response to a question by police about when
    this incident occurred, he replied: “in August 1967”.  He was later asked
    where in the building the incident occurred, to which he replied, “[b]elow
    the back or side stairs.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    jury also heard that, later on the evening of January 11, the appellant told
    another officer, P.C. Couture, that he had nothing to do with the murder.  He

    sole issue before the jury was whether the appellant was responsible for
    Mr. Roy’s murder.  The Crown relied primarily on three pieces of evidence
    in support of a finding that the appellant was the perpetrator. </p>

line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the Crown pointed to the identification of Mrs. Roy.  In closing argument,
    Crown counsel accepted that her identification was not without its problems.  However,
    he asked the jury “not to discard it altogether, but to keep it in your minds
    and give it what weight you feel is proper.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    and of the greatest significance to the Crown’s case, was the appellant’s
    confession to police on January 11, 1972.  Crown counsel reviewed the circumstances
    of the confession, including the police testimony that no force or pressure
    or inducement was used to extract it from the appellant. Crown counsel urged
    the jury to reject the defence suggestion that the appellant learned of the
    details of the murder by reading the newspapers at the time of the murder,
    arguing:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>There is no
    evidence that the accused read the newspaper;  there is evidence that between
    the early evening of the 9<sup>th</sup> August and early morning of the 11<sup>th</sup> August
    he had been somewhere between here and New Liskeard.  No evidence that there
    was anything about this in the New Liskeard paper. </p>

line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    evidence in support of the veracity of the confession, the Crown pointed
    to the confirmatory evidence of Constable Bolger, a police officer with the
    New Liskeard Police Department, who found the appellant in New Liskeard,
    which was where the appellant said he went at around 11:30 p.m. on the night
    of the murder,<a

line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    the Crown relied on the appellant’s confession to Neil Miller and the similarity
    of that confession to the one he gave to the police.  In this regard, Crown
    counsel pointed out that there was no evidence of any pressure on the appellant
    to lie to his friend.</p>

line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defence’s theory of the case was that the appellant’s personality, which
    was affected by an anti-social personality disorder, prompted him to falsely
    confess to the crime.  Defence counsel at the preliminary inquiry referred
    to the possibility of raising an alibi as a defence.  However, partway through
    the trial, during submissions to the court in the jury’s absence, defence
    counsel stated that he had previously advised the Crown that there was “no
    issue” that the accused was in Ottawa on the day in question. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant did not testify on his own behalf. He called a psychiatrist, Dr.
    Arboleda, and a psychologist, Dr. Girodo, to testify that his confession
    was inherently unreliable. The details of the evidence of these experts will
    be provided in responding to the second question raised by the Minister.
    Suffice it to say for present purposes that both experts were of the view
    that the appellant’s psychological profile was such that the appellant had
    a propensity to lie and to invent stories to make him feel important.  The
    doctors were of the view that no reliability should be placed on any of his
    statements in the absence of independent supporting evidence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Arboleda further testified that he questioned the appellant about the truth
    of his confession after giving him sodium amytol, a so-called “truth serum”.  He
    also considered the results of a polygraph test during which the appellant
    said that he had lied to the police when he confessed.  Dr. Arboleda testified
    regarding the results of these tests: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>From the results
    of the two tests given him, I would say that they [give] support to the idea
    that he was actually lying to the police.</p>

line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition to the expert evidence tendered on behalf of the defence, defence
    counsel in closing pointed to the frailties of Mrs. Roy’s identification
    evidence, noting that she did not positively identify the appellant in the
    line-up and that on three different occasions, other people were arrested
    because of identifications she made.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    further theme stressed by defence counsel in closing argument was the “shabby” police
    investigation of this crime.  For example, counsel pointed to the evidence
    that the police had lost the photographs that were shown to Mrs. Roy before
    the line-up, which included pictures of the appellant and his twin brother.  Defence
    counsel pointed out that the jury was denied the opportunity to see these
    photographs so that they might assess what impact they may have had on Mrs.
    Roy’s initial identification of the appellant in the line-up. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Defence
    counsel also asked the jury to resist a finding that the evidence supported
    the truth of the confession in a case where the police had lost fingernail
    scrapings, blood and hair samples removed from the deceased, as well as a
    hair sample voluntarily provided by the appellant.  He argued that these
    samples could have assisted the defence and asked the jury to look very carefully
    at the lack of a proper police investigation in arriving at their verdict.  </p>

    potentially significant to the ongoing investigation of the Roy murder. If

      1998, when the April 12, 1968 report surfaced, Detective McCombie has consistently
      maintained to those who have questioned him about the contents of his report
      (including members of the Innocence Project, Mr. Briggs on behalf of the
      Minister, and in his testimony before this court) that at some point, he
      travelled to Trenton and spoke to the owner of the service station where
      the appellant’s car was repaired in exchange for the car radio. According
      to Detective McCombie, he retrieved both the radio and the tow records
      relating to the appellant’s car from the service station operator. Those
      records, he claimed, discredited the information from the service station
      operator upon which he had based his assertion in the April 12, 1968 report
      that the appellant was in Trenton at a time that made it impossible for
      him to return to Ottawa by the time of the murder. The tow records showed
      that it was physically possible for the appellant to have been in Ottawa
      at the time of the murder. Hence, the so-called Trenton alibi was no longer
      sustainable. Detective McCombie also claimed in his testimony in 2008 before
      this court that he wrote a supplementary report following his trip to Trenton,
      which he attached to the bag containing the radio and tow records and placed
      in the property room of the Ottawa Police Department.  The radio, tow records

      of the matter leads me to conclude that the radio, the tow records, and
      the occurrence report that Detective McCombie claims to have prepared upon
      his return from Trenton – if these items in fact existed and were deposited
      there –
    had gone missing from the property room by January 1972 when the appellant

    matter to overcome the apparent conundrum created by the April 12, 1968 report

      by Det. Nadori to Lieut. Lowry… as a result of a previous request from
      Lieut. Lowry to ascertain from Lieut. McCombie information regarding service
      stations in the Trenton area in reference to a radio being … allegedly
      exchanged by the accused… Lieut. McCombie was unavailable on our departure,
      attending the Canadian Police College.  As a result of the telephone call,
      we were advised by Lieut. Lowry that the service station in question was
      located on the south side of Highway 401, near Trenton, Ontario.  </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span

      Stations were interviewed.  At this time we were advised by the owners
      that they had been in business since approx. 1964-1965 and had no knowledge
      whatsoever of a radio being exchanged as previously mentioned.  At one
      particular Supertest Station, we were advised that it was closed down,
      however, the former proprietor was now operating a Fina Station in Trenton
      proper, and he was also interviewed, however, this met with negative results.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span

      have been able to track down the towing company that brought the appellant’s

      so too is the evidence of other witnesses who testified before us and who
      purported to recall events dating back to 1968 and 1972. Without in any
      way doubting the personal or professional integrity of these witnesses
      or the sincerity of their testimony, the weight to be given to their evidence
      is greatly attenuated by the lengthy passage of time. In Mr. Lindsay’s
      case, he testified that he has virtually no memory of the pertinent events
      or documents surrounding the prosecution of the appellant in 1972. The
      great bulk of his evidence is therefore couched in terms of what he would
      have done or believes he would have done, as opposed to what he actually
      remembers doing. This is not meant as a criticism; it merely reflects the

      despite the appellant’s insistence that he is not challenging their personal
      or professional integrity.  According to the appellant, his position is
      merely that the Crown and the police presumably thought that the appellant’s
      confession trumped his verified alibi.  Yet clearly, in my view, a finding
      by this court that the Crown and the investigating officers proceeded against
      the appellant on the belief that a signed confession trumped an alibi which
      had been verified by one of those same officers carries with it a connotation
      of unethical, if not unlawful, behaviour on their part. One need only state
      the proposition – the appellant could not have committed the murder because
      he was several hundred kilometres away from Ottawa when it occurred, but
      we will prosecute him anyway because we have his signed confession – to
      realize its highly unethical implications. </span></p>

      aside Detective McCombie for the moment, I find it virtually inconceivable
      that Mr. Lindsay and the Ottawa police officers involved in the investigation
      would have participated in prosecuting the appellant for the Roy murder
      knowing that he was innocent of the crime. I acknowledge that people of
      integrity have acted improperly in individual cases: see <i>The Inquiry
      Regarding Thomas Sophonow:  The Investigation, Prosecution and Consideration
      of Entitlement to Compensation </i>(Winnipeg: Manitoba Justice, 2001) (Commissioner:
      The Honourable Peter deCarteret Cory). However, in this case, I reject
      the appellant’s submission that one or more of these individuals may have
      been caught up in the notoriety of the case and viewed it as an opportunity
      to advance their careers. As the Crown points out, far from advancing their
      careers, detection would have spelled professional ruination. And detection
      was a real possibility considering that references to the appellant’s trip
      to the Trenton service station were all over the file – a file in which
      multiple copies of the April 12, 1968 report were located, including a
      copy that had Mr. Lindsay’s notations all over it. Mr. Lindsay and the
      police knew this and they knew as well that a judge could order production
      of any of the contents of the police’s investigation file at any time.  </span></p>

      for Detective McCombie in particular, I cannot gainsay the possibility
      that he may, on his own, have misled his fellow police officers and Mr.
      Lindsay into believing that he had discredited the Trenton alibi when in
      fact he had not. The lack of any documentation confirming his trip to Trenton
      after April 12, 1968 is disconcerting; so too is the loss of the radio
      and tow records he claims to have retrieved. That said, it must be remembered
      that by 1972, when the appellant was charged, many exhibits in this case
      could not be located. Some had gone missing; others were apparently destroyed.
      As well, Detective McCombie’s notes could not be found.</span></p>

      I find it hard to believe that Detective McCombie would have provided the
      Crown and his fellow officers with false information, knowing that in doing
      so he would be promoting the prosecution of a man whom he knew was innocent.
      In this regard, I note that by January 11, 1972 when the appellant was
      charged with the murder, Detective McCombie already had been promoted to
      the rank of Lieutenant and he was no longer in charge of the Roy murder
      investigation. He stood to gain little, if anything, from its successful
      resolution. I note as well that in the period from August 9, 1967 to January
      1, 1972, when Detective McCombie had carriage of the file, the record reveals
      that he treated the appellant fairly and professionally. The record also
      demonstrates his continued willingness to follow-up on various leads relating
      to other possible suspects, thus foreclosing any accusation that he rushed
      to conclude that the appellant was the perpetrator of the crime. Detective
      McCombie’s even-handed investigation undercuts the notion that he would
      have misled Mr. Lindsay and his fellow officers in order to bring about
      the prosecution of a man he knew to be innocent of the crime.</span></p>

      written by Detective McCombie on April 2, 1971. In that report, Detective
      McCombie recounted how on March 25, 1971, the appellant appeared at his
      office and informed him that his twin brother, Donald, who was serving
      a life sentence for murder in the Archambault Institute in Montreal, wished
      to confess to Mr. Roy’s murder. The appellant also told him that Donald
      would tell Detective McCombie where the knife was.  </span></p>

      1967 on the basis of his employment records, which showed that he was in
      New Liskeard at the time of the murder, Detective McCombie travelled to
      Archambault and met with Donald. Donald denied having made these statements
      to his brother and Detective McCombie returned to Ottawa empty-handed.
      In the concluding paragraph of his investigation report detailing those
      events, Detective McCombie wrote as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span

lang=EN-US>According to the Crown, that statement – coming as it did well after
      the April 12, 1968 report and eight-and-a-half months before the appellant
      confessed – provides strong proof that Detective McCombie had indeed discredited
      the Trenton alibi sometime between April 12, 1968 and April 2, 1971.</span></p>

      and the arguments put forward by the parties, I am regrettably at a stalemate
      and find myself unable to determine one way or the other whether Detective
      McCombie did or did not discredit the Trenton alibi. The evidentiary scales
      are equally balanced. Considering that the appellant bears the onus of
      showing on a balance of probabilities that the alibi was not discredited,

      the Trenton alibi was ever discredited is one of vital importance. It should
      have been resolved by the jury at the appellant’s trial in 1972. That did
      not occur because, as I shall endeavour to explain, Mr. Cogan had no knowledge
      of the April 12, 1968 report or its contents or any follow-up investigation

      at the first reasonable opportunity. He cannot have it both ways. I say

lang=EN-US>MR. LINDSAY: Your Honour, the rule about bringing out an alibi at
      the first reasonable opportunity, to my understanding of the law, is that
      you do not bring it out in the Crown’s case. It is a matter for the Defence
      to bring out. My learned friend has put me in the position that any statements
      being put in which were not tendered by the Crown does not deny my friend
      the opportunity of calling an alibi at the first reasonable opportunity.
      There is more than one way of calling an alibi, and in my submission this
      is not the right way to do so.</span></p>

      Crown to determine whether statements of the accused would be led and that
      it did not lie with the defence to adduce such evidence under the pretext
      of putting the Crown on notice of an alibi. In the course of these submissions,
      Mr. Lindsay made the following comment:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>Throughout this preliminary inquiry, Your Honour, we have heard much
      evidence on a lot of aspects of this thing to which there might be other
      reference in the statement which I do not intend to tender. There is the
      fact that this question was asked by the officer the next morning. It has
      to be something that the court has confidence in the Crown to produce as
      to whether it will assist the court. But in my opinion I do not wish to
      tender the statement that Mr. Cogan is examining Detective Sergeant Norton
      about and I have reasons for it which we may disclose at a later time after
      the preliminary inquiry is over. But in my experience at this stage I do

      must agree with Mr. Lindsay that it would not be within the purview of
      [Mr. Cogan’s] cross-examination to obtain [a] conversation from Detective
      Sergeant Norton on the basis of an alibi as an exception to the general
      principle” that the Crown had the discretion to decide which statements

      mind at the preliminary hearing. It is useful, then, to consider both the
      manner of questioning and the content of the questions that Mr. Cogan posed
      to Detectives McCombie and Huneault for purposes of assessing whether he
      knew about the contents of the April 12, 1968 report and in particular,
      the facts and circumstances surrounding the “once verified/later discredited” Trenton
      alibi.  It is also useful to assess whether the answers he received put

      may have been two or three years ago.”  In response to a question from
      the preliminary hearing judge, he claimed that, apart from refreshing his
      memory as to the date of Mr. Roy’s murder, he was giving evidence from

      that in his willsay statement, Detective McCombie mentioned some dealings
      in April 1968 with the New Liskeard police related to information New Liskeard
      had obtained from Gail Brazeau. According to his willsay, while that information
      led to further investigation, “no new evidence was discovered.” Presumably,
      with this passage from the willsay in mind, Mr. Cogan questioned Detective

lang=EN-US>Three observations arise from those exchanges:</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(1)       Detective McCombie testified at
      the preliminary hearing on April 6, 1972, within three months of the time
      that he would have been alerted to and reviewed his April 12, 1968 report.</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO align=left style='text-align:left;

      about the
    <st1:City w:st="on">

    Trenton alibi, either in relation to its initial verification or its subsequent
    discounting; rather, he asked open-ended questions about Detective McCombie’s
    second set of dealings with the New Liskeard police, seemingly ignorant of
    the fact that those dealings had spawned the April 12, 1968 report and an
    apparent follow-up investigation.</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(3)       The answers given by Detective
      McCombie could hardly be characterized as enlightening. Mr. Cogan would
      not have had the slightest sense from the responses that Detective McCombie
      had chosen not to follow-up on a lead developed by the New Liskeard police
      in April 1968.  Nor would he have known that Detective McCombie had dismissed
      the lead because he was satisfied that the appellant had a verified alibi
      and because in April 1968, Mr. Barbe had confirmed, in accordance with
      his original statement, that he had last seen the appellant in Ottawa on
      the night before the murder, not the night of the murder. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>Turning next to Mr. Cogan’s cross-examination of Detective Huneault
      at the preliminary inquiry, it will be recalled that in his willsay statement,
      Detective Huneault mentioned a trip to Trenton on January 2l and 22, 1972,
      in which he and Detective Nadori had searched unsuccessfully for a Supertest
      service station at which the appellant alleged he traded a radio for gas
      and service. With that in mind, Mr. Cogan cross-examined Detective Huneault
      as follows:</span></p>

  <p class=ParaNO align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(1)       Mr. Cogan’s questions about the
      investigation of the appellant’s potential Trenton alibi are not pointed.
      Rather, he appears to be fishing for information. Had he known the contents
      of the April 12, 1968 report, surely he would have questioned Detective
      Huneault extensively about it.</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(2)       Nothing said by Detective Huneault
      would have alerted Mr. Cogan to the fact that the officers had driven to
      Trenton in an attempt to clarify the verified alibi aspect of Detective
      McCombie’s April 12, 1968 report, as mentioned in their “to do list”.</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(3)       Mr. Cogan knew that the appellant
      had spoken to other police officers and had mentioned that he was elsewhere
      at the time of the murder. However, the appellant had given different stories
      to these officers about where he was at the relevant time, with Trenton
      being only one of the possibilities. Detective Huneault’s responses would
      have left Mr.&nbsp;Cogan with the impression that the appellant had mentioned
      Trenton to Detective McCombie and that Huneault and Nadori had gone to
      Trenton to check out his story, only to come away empty-handed. In other
      words, the Trenton alibi, like the others, was baseless and a product of
      the appellant’s imagination.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>In sum, as with Detective McCombie, the answers given by Detective
      Huneault could hardly be described as enlightening. They left Mr. Cogan
      no further ahead as to the contents of the April 12, 1968 report, the circumstances
      giving rise to it, or any subsequent steps Detective McCombie may have
      taken in relation to the information contained in it. </span></p>

      testified that the appellant was in their company at about 10:00 p.m. on
      Wednesday August 9, the night of the murder. Mrs. Barbe testified that
      she did not see the appellant in Ottawa again for some days after that,
      while Mr. Barbe testified that he did not see him again after that night.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>In cross-examination, Mr. Cogan tried unsuccessfully to have the Barbes
      admit that perhaps they had seen the appellant on a different Wednesday,
      not Wednesday the 9th. Significantly, at no time did Mr. Cogan confront
      Mr. Barbe with the suggestion that on two prior occasions, much closer
      to the time of the murder, he had told Detective McCombie that he had last
      seen the appellant on Tuesday August 8, the night before the murder, not
      Wednesday August 9, the night of the murder. Nor were similar questions

lang=EN-US>Surely, if Mr. Cogan had been made aware of the April 12, 1968 report
      or its contents, he would have questioned the Barbes and Detective McCombie
      about this important inconsistency. Once again, the silence of the transcript
      bears witness to his lack of awareness.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>Whereas the preliminary inquiry transcript speaks eloquently through
      its silence to Mr. Cogan’s lack of awareness of the contents of the April
      12, 1968 report, the trial record does so even more persuasively. Astoundingly,
      the jury sat through the entire trial hearing the word “Trenton” only once,
      when Detective Huneault in his examination in chief repeated the appellant’s
      confession and recounted him stating that he drove to Trenton at around
      11:30 on the night of the murder. This is all the more astonishing when
      one considers that after the preliminary inquiry and before the trial,
      Mr. Lindsay believed that the appellant might be advancing alibi (as confirmed
      by his pre-trial notes found in the archives) and Trenton stood out among
      the various alibi locations identified by the appellant as the one most
      likely to be pursued.  </span></p>

      alibi going into the trial. Indeed, as the trial record shows, he spent
      a good deal of effort trying to persuade the trial judge to admit the appellant’s
      statement to Detective Norton on the morning of January 12, 1972, in which
      the final question and answer between Detective Norton and the appellant
      read as follows:</span></p>

lang=EN-US>In acknowledging that alibi was still in play at the trial, the Crown
      in its factum contends that Mr. Cogan’s purpose for seeking to admit the
      so-called Norton statement was as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>The Norton statement, if admitted, would have seeded the suggestion
      of a Trenton alibi without the necessity of calling Phillion.  Mr. Cogan
      could have cross-examined the police, notwithstanding the fact that the
      alibi was discounted.  Mr. Cogan could have made hay of the fact that the
      police had lost the tow records just as he made hay regarding the other
      lost evidence.  Mr. Cogan could have played on the Crown’s inability, due
      to the police loss of the tow records, to pinpoint the exact time that
      Romeo had been there. Taken together with Detectives Nadori and Huneault’s
      subsequent inability to locate the station, this would have ensured that
      the jury got through the back door the suggestion of an alibi, and the
      Crown was not in a clear position to disprove it, without needing to call
      his client.</span></p>

      reasons that need not be discussed, the trial judge refused to admit the
      Norton statement and the jury heard nothing of it. It was only then, after
      suffering that setback that Mr. Cogan apparently gave up on alibi. Again,
      as the Crown put it in its factum: “Once the Norton statement was excluded,
      then there was no way to raise the Trenton alibi or the lost Trenton tow
      records without the appellant testifying, which was not a viable option.” In
      out-of-court discussions with Mr.&nbsp;Lindsay sometime after the trial
      judge’s ruling, Mr. Cogan agreed not to contest the appellant’s presence
      in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place

    Ottawa at the time of the murder. </span>I hasten to point out that this
    was not a formal admission of fact by Mr. Cogan.  As is apparent from the
    record, in return for that concession, Mr.&nbsp;Cogan understood that he
    was obtaining the Crown’s agreement not to lead Mrs. Barbe’s evidence concerning
    the appellant’s statement to her husband that he wanted to sell him his car

lang=EN-US>The answer to the question whether Mr. Lindsay had a duty to disclose
      the report or its contents lies not in the dictates of our present-day
      disclosure regime but in the dictates of the disclosure regime that existed
      in 1972. In this regard, it would hardly be fair to criticize as “unfair” Crown
      disclosure practices that would not pass muster under today’s standards,
      but which were acceptable under the standards that prevailed in 1972.  As
      this court stated in <i>Truscott</i>, at para. 122:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-GB>The appellant would approach the claim, at least in part, on the basis
      that present-day disclosure standards to which Crown counsel must now adhere
      are the measure of fairness.&nbsp;

    to decide whether a diagnostic protocol followed in 1959 amounted to malpractice.&nbsp;</span><span lang=EN-US> </span></p>

lang=EN-US>With that in mind, I begin my analysis with the undisputed observation
      that even in 1972, it would have been incumbent on the Crown to disclose
      to the defence an alibi that was verified by the police. But that is not
      this case, necessarily. As explained earlier, whether Detective McCombie
      did or did not discredit the Trenton alibi is something that remains a
      mystery.  Regrettably, this question was not resolved when it should have
      been – by the jury at the appellant’s trial. Be that as it may, in my view,
      Mr. Lindsay was entitled to rely on the representations of the lead investigating
      officer that he had discredited the once verified Trenton alibi. Such reliance
      is particularly unobjectionable when the information that Mr. Lindsay received
      from Detectives Huneault and Nadori following their trips to
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Trenton in January 1972 would not have given him any cause to doubt the discounting
    of the alibi. In addition, the information conveyed to him by Detectives
    Huneault and Nadori regarding the Barbes’ statements to these officers in
    January 1972, indicating that the Barbes last saw the appellant on the night
    of the murder, was similarly consistent with the discounting of the Trenton
    alibi.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-US>[152]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>In these circumstances, the question to be decided is not whether
      Mr. Lindsay was obliged to disclose a verified alibi, but whether he was
      obliged to disclose an alibi that he believed had been discredited. In
      response, I know of no authority and none was presented to us, that would
      cause me to conclude that such an obligation existed in 1972 –
    and given the wide discretion that Crown counsel enjoyed in that era, I doubt
    that it did.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-US>[153]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>Manifestly, even in those times, Crown counsel could not withhold
      information that supported an accused’s innocence. But an apparently discredited
      alibi hardly fits that description. And, in my view, if an obligation could
      be said to exist it would only arise, if at all, once the accused had notified
      the authorities of the alibi upon which he or she proposed to rely.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

lang=EN-US>[154]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>That of course did not occur here. At no time did Mr. Cogan notify
      the police or Mr. Lindsay of a particular alibi upon which the appellant
      intended to rely. Absent such notice, Mr. Lindsay was under no obligation
      to disclose a piece of evidence that would, in the circumstances, have
      been irrelevant to a fact in issue.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[155]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>And that, in my view, explains why Mr. Lindsay was so insistent at
      the preliminary inquiry that the appellant should not be permitted to give
      notice of an alibi through the back door, as it were, by means of out-of-court
      statements he had made to the police.  As Mr. Lindsay maintained in his
      submissions at the preliminary, if the appellant was going to rely on alibi,
      it was incumbent on him to raise it through admissible evidence or through
      proper notification procedures.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>In so concluding, I have not ignored Mr. Lindsay’s testimony before
      us to the effect that he personally (and perhaps all Crown attorneys) would
      have felt obliged to disclose a discredited alibi, just as he would a verified
      alibi. While I do not doubt the sincerity of his testimony, I think, with
      respect, that present-day practices have crept into his thinking and have
      coloured his perception of the practices that he considered were appropriate
      in 1972.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>My thinking in this regard is confirmed by Mr. Lindsay’s similar belief
      that he was also duty-bound to disclose prior inconsistent statements of
      witnesses and specifically, the alleged inconsistent statements made by
      Mr. Barbe concerning his last sighting of the appellant in Ottawa in relation
      to the murder.  Even the appellant does not contend that the Crown had
      any duty to disclose prior witness statements in 1972. Indeed, in his factum,
      he concedes, correctly in my view, that the decision to disclose prior
      inconsistent statements was a matter within the Crown’s discretion. </span></p>

      of the 1972 disclosure regime that count. Given my conclusion that he did
      not disclose the April 12, 1968 report or its contents to Mr. Cogan, what
      matters in my view, is the propriety of his conduct, having regard to the
      disclosure obligations that were binding on him in 1972.</span></p>

      the proposed fresh evidence is not admissible on the basis that the trial

    decide whether he had in fact travelled to

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Trenton and obtained information that enabled him to truly discredit the
    alibi, that circumstance alone could have had a dramatic impact on the outcome
    of the trial. Put simply, if the lead investigating officer was satisfied
    that the appellant was in Trenton near the time of the killing and that he
    and a superior officer were so certain of the appellant’s lack of involvement
    that they were prepared to forgo an important lead in the case presented
    by the New Liskeard Police Department, that evidence, on its own, could have
    left the jury in a state of reasonable doubt about the appellant’s guilt.</span></p>

      considered with the once-clear recollection of Mr. Barbe, and potentially
      that of Mrs.&nbsp;Barbe as well, that the appellant was last seen by the
      Barbes at 10:00 p.m. on August 8, the night before the murder, not 10:00

      in August 1967, bingo games were held by a different organization on Tuesdays.
      In light of this body of evidence, the jury may well have been left in

    acknowledge the possibility that a jury could view the appellant’s confessions
    in that light. But not necessarily, especially if Detective McCombie were

    that regard, while I acknowledge that the appellant’s statements contain
    a number of accurate details, many of them were reported by the press and
    thus they were in the public domain. Indeed, at trial, Detective Huneault
    agreed with Mr. Cogan that “the facts of this particular crime are really
    no mystery, if one read the newspaper clippings in 1967”. Of the twelve newspaper
    articles published in 1967, I have reproduced one from the Ottawa Journal,
    dated August 10, 1967, at Appendix D. Without reviewing it line by line,
    suffice it to say that it incorporates the vast majority of the twenty items
    my colleague has identified as “completely true or probably true”. Beyond
    that, there is no way of knowing what the appellant may have learned about
    the murder, initially from Detective McCombie and later from the New Liskeard
    police or any other persons with whom the police may have shared information,
    including for example, Gail Brazeau, the appellant’s former girlfriend.</p>

    that is not all. As is the case with eye-witness identification, one wrong
    feature in a confession may overshadow or at least neutralize a host of other
    features that are accurate or near accurate. In this case, there is one telling
    feature of the appellant’s confession to the police that everyone, including
    the Crown, concedes is clearly wrong.</p>

    make things up and he did so to gain attention and make himself feel important.

    it is noteworthy that within hours of confessing to the police, the appellant

    Cogan could have been had he been able to combine that argument with the

      then leaves the third component of the <i>Palmer</i> test, sometimes referred
      to as the “due diligence” test. In its factum, the Crown does not suggest
      that Mr. Cogan, through diligence, could have learned about the contents
      of the April 12, 1968 report as it relates to the Trenton alibi. While
      there was some movement away from that concession in oral argument, I think
      the Crown’s original position is the correct one. Due diligence should
      not be equated with a lucky guess. The fact that Mr. Cogan might have happened
      upon the information related to the Trenton alibi had he asked the right
      questions of Detective McCombie or Detective Huneault begs the question.
      It smacks of Monday-morning quarterbacking and ignores that the answers
      he received at the preliminary inquiry, particularly from Detective McCombie,
      were less than forthcoming and hardly enlightening. </span></p>

      for Mr. Barbe’s previous statements referred to in the April 12, 1968 report,
      the Crown submits that Mr. Cogan could have learned of these through due
      diligence. I question the validity of that submission. There is no indication
      in the record that Mr. or Mrs. Barbe provided a written statement to Detective
      McCombie at any time.  The only mention of Mr. Barbe’s original statements
      is found in the April 12, 1968 report. The record reveals that both the
      Barbes and Detective McCombie were vague in their recollection of their
      initial conversations and had little memory of specific details.</span></p>

      follows, in my view, that the April 12, 1968 report was the only source
      from which Mr. Cogan could realistically have obtained the alleged prior
      inconsistent statements of Mr. Barbe and possibly Mrs. Barbe, if she indeed
      gave a prior inconsistent statement to Detective McCombie.  </span></p>

      that the interests of justice would warrant the reception of the entirety
      of the April 12, 1968 report.  This is primarily because the significance
      of any inconsistency in the Barbes’ evidence is integrally linked to the

      in assessing the due diligence requirement, I feel obliged to address why
      Mr. Cogan needed the police to tell him about the Trenton alibi rather
      than being able to learn this information from the appellant himself. In
      many, if not most instances of alibi, it is for the client to inform counsel
      of his or her whereabouts at the time of the crime for purposes of leading
      an alibi defence. The client’s failure to do so would normally provide
      a full answer to the due diligence criterion, thereby rendering the proposed
      fresh evidence inadmissible. </span></p>

      this case is anything but normal. By all accounts, the appellant at the
      best of times is an unreliable historian and is prone to making up tales.
      Indeed, at his trial, two doctors testified that absent independent confirmation,
      they would not place any reliance on what he had to say. That evidence
      was led in the context of the appellant’s confession, with a view to impressing
      the jury of the need to proceed carefully before relying on the appellant’s
      confession alone to convict him.</span></p>

      going into detail about the appellant’s psychiatric make-up or the bizarre
      behaviour he has engaged in, I accept Mr. Cogan’s evidence and am satisfied
      that the appellant was a difficult client (to say the least) and that Mr.
      Cogan would have had a hard time discerning when his client was telling
      him the truth and when he was lying to him. In that regard, I note, as
      mentioned earlier, that Trenton was but one of a handful of alibi locations
      that the appellant had mentioned in his dealings with the police. </span></p>

      Mr.&nbsp;Cogan was hampered by the fact that the charge against the appellant
      came more than four years after the event. By then, as attested to by the
      unsuccessful efforts of Detectives Nadori and Huneault to track down the
      Trenton service station, Mr. Cogan would have had great difficulty confirming
      any information the appellant might have provided to him about Trenton.
      In short, it seems to me that anything that was going to be learned about
      the Trenton alibi after the appellant was charged in 1972 was locked away
      in Detective McCombie’s memory, apart of course from what appears in the
      April 12, 1968 report.</span></p>

      of no tactical reason why Mr. Cogan would not have been interested in the
      contents of the April 12, 1968 report, and no reason why he would not have

      test is an easy one to meet in historical cases – it is not. Here, the
      April 12, 1968 report derives its cogency from a constellation of factors

      missing. So too had Detective McCombie’s notes, as well as any documentation
      that could have confirmed the steps he allegedly took to discredit the
      Trenton alibi he once considered to have been verified. That the lead investigating
      officer was at one point convinced that the man ultimately charged with
      the offence had a verified alibi is itself a rare, if not unprecedented
      feature of this case. Added to those unusual features, the case for the

      whatever there was to know about the Trenton alibi was locked away in Detective
      McCombie’s mind and he did not readily give up the key to that information

    2002, Dr. Turrall completed a neuropsychological assessment of the appellant
    related to his conviction for Mr. Roy’s murder.  Dr. Turrall also reviewed
    a number of past psychiatric and psychological assessments that had been
    performed on the appellant while he was in custody. In his report, Dr. Turrall
    concluded that the appellant “continues to demonstrate some antisocial and
    borderline personality features.” He described the key features of the appellant’s
    personality traits as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Personality
    configuration identified Mr. Phillion as a dependent and depressive individual
    with a tendency for attention seeking behaviours and impulsivity. <i>Personality
    functioning is suggestive of an individual who needs to be seen by others
    as important and special</i>. Historically this need for attention and recognition
    in part is judged to be Mr.&nbsp;Phillion's <i>attempt to elevate himself
    from the reality that he was inadequate and incompetent as a person</i>. <i>Mr.&nbsp;Phillion’s
    impulsiveness, poor judgement and impaired insight exacerbated this basic
    personality style. Such an individual would therefore be prone to exaggerate
    or fabricate with the expectation that some type of recognition could be
    forthcoming to him</i> even if the statements he made to others were false.
    Mr. Phillion’s documented history attests to his fabrication and embellishment
    of the truth to the extent that people in authority have often stated that
    Mr. Phillion's statements cannot be believed. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>For example,
    prior to his arrest Mr. Phillion suggested to his 17 year old lover, Mr.
    Miller that he killed Mr. Roy. This statement coming from such an individual
    with his personality makeup would be immediately suspect as an attempt at
    self aggrandisement. Similar statements were made to the police during questioning
    following Mr. Phillion's arrest in January, 1972. After being placed in a
    cell following the signed confession, custodial officers recorded that Mr.&nbsp;Phillion
    asked to see a newspaper. <i>A person with Mr.&nbsp;Phillion’s personality
    configuration would have revelled in his media recognition</i>. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>A review of
    his past psychiatric and psychological records noted that Mr. Phillion had
    been evaluated by several practitioners on several occasions since his admission
    to custody. The results of his past evaluations repeatedly referred to Mr.
    Phillion as an immature, impulsive, attention seeking, intellectually limited,
    inadequate, dependent, depressive and antisocial individual. Given all available
    information and the results of this psychological assessment, I concur with
    the above description of Mr. Phillion. His personality traits fit the type
    of person who could confess to a crime that he did not commit, especially
    a serious and high profile crime like the unsolved murder of Mr. Roy. [Emphasis

    for testing personality features relevant to the reliability of confessions:
    the Gudjonsson Suggestibility Scale and the Gudjonsson Compliance Scale.
    Pertinent to this case is Dr. Gudjonsson’s participation in the development
    of a three-part classification scheme or “typology”
    for describing the nature and cause of false confessions. The category relevant
    to the appellant is labelled, “voluntary false confessions”, the characteristics
    of which are outlined in the appellant’s factum as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><b>Voluntary
      false confession</b>: These are provided by people without external pressure
      from the police and are common in high profile cases. They may be motivated

    a pathological need to be infamous or draw attention to himself”;</p>

    Gudjonsson’s testing of the appellant largely confirmed Dr. Turrall’s findings,
    as demonstrated in the following passage from his report:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><i>I concur
      with the conclusions of Dr. Graham Turrall, dated 11 September 2002, that
      Mr. Phillion has “Personality configuration composed of the following:
      depressive and dependent personality traits and borderline personality
      features</i>.” This is probably the best descriptive diagnosis of his personality.
      A review of Mr. Phillion’s psychiatric and psychological records indicate
      that he has been diagnosed as suffering from “antisocial personality disorder” and “borderline
      personality disorder.” These are appropriate diagnoses for his condition.
      Phillion still exhibits a number of features associated with these diagnoses,
      including <i>antisocial personality traits, impulsivity, dependency, attention
      seeking, poor self-esteem, paranoid personality traits, and mood disturbance</i>. … I
      am in no doubt that <i>his major vulnerability in the past, and presently,
      has been his poor self-esteem, and lack of confidence in himself when interacting
      with others</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>

line-height:normal;'>[205]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Gudjonsson commented in his report on several motivating factors that may
    have led the appellant to falsely confess, including his relationship with
    Neil Miller, the “emotional build up” from his arrest for the armed robbery
    of a taxi driver, his “severe emotional and self-esteem problems”, as well
    as his “antisocial orientation, impaired rational judgment, dislike of the
    police, and disregard for the consequences of his actions.” Of these factors,
    Dr. Gudjonsson identified the appellant’s low self-esteem and need for notoriety
    to enhance his self-esteem as the “single best explanation for the confession,
    if he truly made a false confession.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[206]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    both his report and testimony, Dr. Gudjonsson focused on the accuracy of
    the appellant’s confessions when tested against the known facts surrounding
    the murder and the possibility that the appellant’s knowledge about the crime
    was the result of contamination from outside sources, such as the media,
    the police or his visits to the crime scene with the police. He also compared
    and contrasted features of the appellant’s case that in his view were analogous
    to cases in which false confessions have been given.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[207]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Gudjonsson concluded that the appellant’s confessions to Neil Miller and
    the Ottawa police are “inherently unreliable”
    and “unsafe to rely on” in the absence of “good independent corroboration”.
    In reaching this conclusion, Dr. Gudjonsson wrote as follows: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><i>If Mr. Phillion's
      confession to the police about the murder of Mr. Roy is false,</i> <i>which
      is probably the case</i>, then the most significant factor is likely to
      have been his desire and need to enhance his vulnerable self-esteem by
      becoming somebody important (i.e. both in the eyes of the police and Mr.
      Miller), while at the same time also possibly taking his revenge out on
      the police (i.e. sending them on “a wild goose-chase”) for intensively
      searching for him after the attempted robbery of the taxi driver and, perhaps
      as a result of his general view of the police case. [Emphasis added.]</p>

    July 2008, the Crown cross-examined Dr. Gudjonsson about the contents of

'>[12]</span></span></span></a> When counsel asked him about the belief expressed
    in his report that the appellant’s confession was probably false, Dr. Gudjonsson
    conceded that, in expressing his personal view about the truth or falsity
    of the confession, he went beyond the limits of scientific evaluation because
    there is no psychological test that can be used to determine whether a confession
    is false or not.  He explained that he ought to have limited his opinion
    to whether or not the confession was reliable.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[209]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    further cross-examination, Dr. Gudjonsson expressed the view that the appellant’s
    antisocial and borderline personality disorders were interrelated causal
    factors that might have led to a voluntary false confession:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><i>Antisocial
      makes him unreliable and so forth and irresponsible and not considering
      the consequences of his actions; whereas borderline is more related to
      affect, that he gets very emotional about things, he has difficulties in
      relationships, he’s up and down in his mood, and he has low self-esteem
      problems with identity and impulsivity. </i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>So when you
    bring these together, so it's the combination of these things that is important
    in understanding what happened at the police station and in his interaction
    with Mr. Miller. That’s what I think is quite a key. But also there may be
    other factors that are important because obviously I've looked at more than
    just that, but I think these personality disorders are quite a key in being
    able to articulate a link. <i>You see, the doctors at his trial didn’t actually
    articulate in the way I have how these separate disorders interacted. It
    might have led to him being an unreliable informant in relation to the confession
    to the murder.</i> [Emphasis added.] </p>

    response to the report tendered by Dr. Gudjonsson, the Crown retained Dr.&nbsp;Michael

      <st1:place w:st="on">
      United States</st1:country-region>

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[211]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his report, Dr. Welner commented disparagingly on some of the methods used
    by Dr. Gudjonsson to assess false confessions. In particular, he challenged
    the assertion that, through the work of Dr. Gudjonsson and others, the study
    of false confessions has advanced to the point that it provides a scientific
    methodology for determining the reliability of a confession. Dr. Welner was
    cross-examined at length on his views and the appellant is highly critical
    of his evidence, alleging that Dr. Welner lacks
    “expertise in both psychology and scientific methodology”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[212]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    great deal of time was spent in oral argument debating, in particular, the
    admissibility of Dr.&nbsp;Gudjonsson’s evidence as expert evidence and whether
    his evidence meets the criteria of relevance and necessity identified in <i>R.
    v. Mohan</i>, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 9. On the issue of relevance, the Crown maintains
    that much of Dr. Gudjonsson’s proposed evidence lacks scientific reliability.
    The Crown submits:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>What is apparent
    in reviewing the evidence is the lack of scientific reliability to the doctor’s
    opinion. The science that Dr. Gudjonsson speaks of is the science of case
    studies. Essentially, Dr. Gudjonsson, to arrive at a conclusion, looks at
    all the circumstances of the case, and, having regard to his own past cases
    of disputed confessions, renders an opinion on the reliability of the confession
    at hand.<span lang=EN-US> It is not science to point to a handful of cases
    and draw a conclusion from them. There is no evidence that there is a large
    enough body of cases of demonstrably proven false confessions available from
    which one can derive norms of human behaviour respecting why people falsely
    confess. There is no process to test results or reproduce the same result.
    This is not surprising given the difficulty of establishing the existence
    of a false confession in the first place. </span>There is no statistical
    analysis that can be completed, no error rates and ability to validate the
    method used. There is no definition provided for a “reliable”
    confession. These problems are not due to Dr.&nbsp;Gudjonsson alone but rather,
    as stated by one United States Supreme Court [<i>People v. Wiggins</i>, 851
    N.Y.S.2d 60 (Sup. Ct. 2007), at p. 6], “they reflect the very limited progress
    that has so far been made in developing a truly scientific body of knowledge
    about false confessions.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[213]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    support of the claim that Dr. Gudjonsson’s evidence lacks scientific reliability,
    the Crown relies heavily on his acknowledgement that his research merely
    provides a “conceptual framework for understanding”
    why people falsely confess; it does not enable anyone to state scientifically
    that a particular confession is reliable or unreliable.  The Crown also relies
    on Dr. Gudjonsson’s further acknowledgment that the field of giving opinions
    on the reliability or unreliability of confessions is not one “where you
    can get error rates.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[214]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown points out that in seeking to exclude Dr. Gudjonsson’s evidence, it
    is not, as the appellant claims in his factum, seeking to “exclude the insights
    of psychology into the disordered personality of those making false confessions”.
    Rather, the Crown contends that: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>There is nothing
    wrong with leading evidence of a person’s personality defects to suggest
    that he lied when confessing. Phillion’s trial proceeded this way. What is
    objectionable is allowing an expert, under the guise of science, to state
    whether a confession is reliable or not, when there is, in fact, no scientific
    foundation for such an assertion. What is being objected to is allowing an
    expert to tell a jury that he knows what is a reliable confession simply
    because he is an expert.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[215]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the issue of necessity, the Crown maintains that much of Dr.&nbsp;Gudjonsson’s
    proposed evidence relates to matters that ordinary people can understand
    and form a correct judgment about without the assistance of an expert. Moreover,
    there is the ever-present danger, especially with someone like Dr.&nbsp;Gudjonsson,
    that members of the jury could be overwhelmed by his credentials and would
    not be able to objectively assess his evidence and thus the proposed expert
    evidence might usurp the role of the jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[216]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    for the appellant’s contention that Dr. Gudjonsson’s evidence is necessary
    to shed light on the fact that false confessions do occur and to rebut the
    commonly-held view that people would not confess to a serious crime they
    have not committed, the Crown maintains that the trial judge could alert
    the jury to this possibility in the instructions to the jury, thereby removing
    the possible need for an expert.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[217]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    have identified the Crown’s objections to the admission of Dr.&nbsp;Gudjonsson’s
    evidence in considerable detail because, at the very least, they show that
    the admissibility of expert evidence on false confessions is anything but
    obvious and should be approached with considerable caution. Of particular
    concern is whether the proposed evidence reaches the level of scientific
    reliability required by <i>Mohan</i> to warrant its reception.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[218]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    said, I want to be clear that, in cases such as this where the reliability
    of a confession is in issue, expert evidence regarding an accused’s personality
    traits that is relevant to and probative of the issue will be admissible.
    As the Crown points out, that type of evidence was properly led at the appellant’s
    trial. I turn to that evidence now, since in my view, the expert evidence
    called at the trial is dispositive of the question posed to this court by
    the Minister of Justice.  This is because the expert evidence called at trial
    shows that the proposed new evidence is not “fresh” evidence and therefore
    not admissible under <i>Palmer</i>.</p>

    light. Dr. Girodo concluded that the appellant lacked any sense of identity

    seeks to introduce through Dr. Gudjonsson and to a lesser extent Dr. Turrall:</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span
lang=EN-US>Q.        [Mr. Cogan] Let’s just deal with this for a moment.  The
      man who lacks self-image, as Mr. Phillion, comments such as, “Is there
      anything about me in a newspaper,” or “in the newspaper.”  Is that something
      which you would find significant with him after, for example, he may have
      made a confession to a murder and shortly thereafter, in a request for
      newspapers, makes a comment, “Is there anything about me in the newspaper.”</span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span
lang=EN-US>A.        That would be consistent with that personality I have described,
      yes.</span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span
lang=EN-US>Q.        And in addition to that, the comment by him equating “something
      big like murder,”
    the term “big”, how would that – what would that reflect of this man; that
    his lack of self-image – is the “bigness” something that reflects his identity?</span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span
lang=EN-US>A.        </span>It could be seen that way.  The sense of extra large,
    extra big – not grandiosity, I don’t want to use the term grandiosity, but
    hyperbole, extreme – “big” would be very important in the sense of trying
    to achieve something which was extraordinary.</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New Roman"'>Q.        </span><span lang=EN-US
style='font-family:&quot;Times New \(W1\)&quot;;
'>If one was searching for a positive identity one would brag about a lot of
      things we did that were good for society, and one who is searching for
      a negative personality would say a lot of things that were antisocial;
      for example that he committed a lot of crimes.  Is that consistent?</span></p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText><span

    Julio Arboleda, a forensic psychiatrist, also testified for the appellant
    at trial. Like Dr. Girodo, he expressed the opinion that the appellant suffered
    from an antisocial personality disorder. He explained that persons with this
    type of disorder lack a sense of responsibility, are impulsive, have difficulty
    forming personal relationships, exploit others for their own gain, and are
    unable to foresee the consequences of their acts.</p>

    to Dr. Arboleda, the appellant confided that his reason for falsely confessing
    was that “he just wanted to be on the radio, make the news”. In Dr.&nbsp;Arboleda’s
    opinion, the appellant engaged in boastful behaviour to enhance his self-image.  He
    further testified that the appellant was theatrical, he liked to exaggerate,
    and he was prone to using attention-seeking devices, including dramatic suicide
    attempts. Dr.&nbsp;Arboleda dismissed the possibility that the appellant
    may have confessed to the murder out of feelings of remorse, stating:  “He

    that he would not believe anything the appellant said, absent supporting
    facts:</p>
  <p class=MsoBodyText>Q.        [Mr. Cogan] <i>And from your experience, Dr.
      Arboleda, does he indicate the type of personality that shows a propensity

      I have already said, this is the kind of person that needs to make himself
      important to others.  Usually he has practically nothing to be important
      about, so one of the things he does is to lie or to boast or to brag about
      things – whether they are good or bad, it would really be irrelevant to
      the case</i>, but in his own particular case and perhaps as part of the
      social environment in which he has moved himself for the past –
    many years of his life, this seems to enhance his personality in front of
    others.  Saying to others or bragging to others that he had done this or
    that, that helps his self-image, that helps him to keep a sense of identity
    that he is something and even if he has not done so, whether he has done
    it or not, he needs to make things bigger so others get this picture of him.</p>
  <p><span

  <p class=MsoBodyTextIndent3><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Q.        So, that, Dr. Arboleda on the basis of the
      factors you have told the members of the jury about the results of the
      psychological examination of Dr. Girodo, your interview, the statements
      made by the accused and the results of the sodium amytol or truth serum
      test, as well as the lie-detector test, what is your opinion as to the – whether
      or not the accused lied when he said he confessed to the murder?</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    in the normal way; I would not place any reliability on his normal statements,
    no matter what they may be.  <i>From the results of the two tests given him,
    I would say that they [give] support to the idea that he was actually lying
    to the police.</i>  That is all I can [sic]. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[230]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Much
    like the evidence provided by Dr. Girodo, these extracts from Dr. Arboleda's
    evidence mirror critical elements of the so-called
    “fresh evidence” that the appellant seeks to introduce through Dr. Gudjonsson
    and to a lesser extent, Dr. Turrall. Indeed, the emphasized portion of Dr.&nbsp;Arboleda’s
    final response goes further than the proposed testimony of Dr.&nbsp;Gudjonsson,
    who candidly acknowledged that he had no scientific basis for expressing
    an opinion on whether the appellant’s confession was false.  Moreover, through
    Dr. Arboleda, the jury came to learn that the appellant had voluntarily undergone
    a sodium amytol or “truth serum” test and a polygraph test, and that the
    results were consistent with him having lied to the police when he confessed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[231]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    have engaged in this exercise to demonstrate that the jury who tried the
    appellant had before it the substance of Drs. Turrall’s and Gudjonsson’s
    evidence. Drs. Girodo and Arboleda identified the same key personality traits
    that the new experts identified: the appellant’s antisocial personality;
    his poor self-esteem; his inclination to seek a negative identity; his difficulty
    in forming personal relationships; his impulsiveness; and his tendency to
    exaggerate or lie in order to gain attention and make himself feel important. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[232]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    the extent that Drs. Gudjonsson and Turrall added the formal diagnosis of
    borderline personality to the appellant’s personality profile, that label
    adds nothing to what the jury already knew about him, namely, that he was
    a person with low self-esteem who needed to make himself feel important.
    Although Drs.&nbsp;Girodo and Arboleda did not use the “borderline”
    label, they took this aspect of the appellant’s personality into account
    in their assessment of him. In the circumstances, I view the addition of
    this label as inconsequential and reject Dr. Gudjonsson’s position that the
    borderline label captures a feature of the appellant’s profile that was not
    explained to the jury at his trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[233]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    for the appellant’s contention that what the jury lacked was not the substance
    of Dr. Gudjonsson’s evidence but the fact that such evidence now has “the
    force of science” behind it, I have already expressed my view that this assertion
    is open to debate. But even if Dr. Gudjonsson’s proposed testimony does have
    the force of science behind it, I am not at all persuaded that his evidence
    if believed could reasonably, when taken with the other evidence adduced
    at trial, be expected to have affected the result.  In other words, Dr. Gudjonsson’s
    evidence, as well as that of Dr. Turrall, does not satisfy the third prong
    of the cogency test in <i>Palmer </i>and is therefore not admissible as fresh
    evidence. In the words of Doherty&nbsp;J.A. in <i>R. v. M. (P.S.)</i> (1992),
    77 C.C.C. (3d) 402, at pp. 411-12, the proposed evidence is not “‘fresh’ evidence
    in any relevant sense” but only “a third voice which speaks to the exact
    issues addressed” at trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[234]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Those
    issues were aptly summarized by Ritchie J. for the majority of the Supreme
    Court of Canada in the appellant’s appeal in <i>Phillion</i>,<i> </i>at pp.
    22-23:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The appellant
    elected to give no evidence, but in lieu thereof expert witnesses were called
    for the defence, including a psychiatrist and a psychologist whose evidence
    was directed to showing that the appellant had a deranged personality and
    particularly that he would have a tendency to invent and attest to circumstances
    which never happened in order to satisfy his desire to attract attention
    to himself. These witnesses … were obviously called to support the contention
    that the appellant had been lying when he confessed to the police…</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[235]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the same decision, Spence J., speaking for himself and Laskin C.J., referred
    at p. 20 to the nature and effect of the psychiatric and psychological evidence
    adduced at trial:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The defence
    was permitted to adduce the evidence of Dr.&nbsp;Julio Arboleda, a duly qualified
    medical practitioner specializing in the field of psychiatry. After a lengthy <i>voir
    dire</i>, Dr. Arboleda was permitted to give his opinion based on two psychiatric
    interviews he had with the appellant, on certain psychological tests which
    had been given to the appellant by a Dr. Michael Girodo who also testified
    for the appellant, and upon the results of the polygraph tests taken by John
    Reid [The trial judge ruled that Mr. Reid, an experienced polygraph examiner,
    could not testify before the jury]. Therefore, the result attributed by the
    expert defence witness to the polygraph tests was already before the jury
    and, in my view, before that jury in a much more persuasive fashion that
    it could ever have been put by a non-medical witness. It is very evident
    that the jury refused to accept the opinions expressed by Dr. Arboleda and
    Dr.&nbsp;Girodo and one could not therefore have expected them to have had
    any regard for the polygraph results which were only one of the materials
    upon which the expert witness Dr.&nbsp;Arboleda based his opinion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[236]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    many ways, it could be said that Mr. Cogan was ahead of his time in the defence
    he presented on behalf of the appellant. He provided the jury with psychological
    evidence designed to cast doubt on the reliability of the appellant’s confession.
    In the end, the jury did not accept that evidence. But the evidence heard
    by the jury at trial captured the essence of the testimony that the appellant
    now seeks to introduce through Dr. Gudjonsson and Dr. Turrall as fresh evidence.
    It therefore fails the cogency test in <i>Palmer</i> and must be rejected. </p>

      admitted against the backdrop of the evidence that was adduced at the appellant’s
      trial and I am satisfied, on balance, that the evidence in its entirety
      could reasonably support a conviction.  Depending on how the fresh evidence
      were to unfold at a new trial, it would be open to a jury to reject the
      defence of alibi and conclude, essentially on the basis of the appellant’s
      confessions to Mr. Miller and the police, that he was the person who murdered
      Mr. Roy. Hence, substituting a verdict of acquittal on the basis that the
      fresh evidence is
    “clearly decisive” of innocence is not a tenable position:  see <i>R. v.
    Stolar</i>, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 480 and <i>R. v. Baltovich</i> (2004), 73 O.R.

lang=EN-US>Nor, in my view, is this a case in which it can be said that, on the
      basis of the information now available, it is
    “clearly more probable than not” that the appellant would be acquitted at
    a hypothetical new trial:  see <i>Truscott</i>, para. 268.  Much would depend
    on how the fresh evidence were to unfold at a new trial and how the jury
    were to assess it. One possibility is that the jury could find the appellant
    to be factually innocent.  Alternatively, the jury could entertain a reasonable
    doubt about his guilt. Another tenable possibility is that the jury could
    reject the defence of alibi and find the appellant guilty, essentially on
    the basis of his confessions.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>To be clear, just because the fresh evidence referred to in the first
      question of the terms of reference passes the cogency test in <i>Palmer</i>,
      this does not mean that it is “clearly more probable than not” that the
      appellant would be acquitted at a new trial. All that can be said is that,
      in the context of the entirety of the evidence admitted on appeal and heard
      at trial, the fresh evidence could reasonably be expected to have changed
      the result at trial. In other words, if the jury had had the benefit of
      the information contained in the April 12, 1968 report, that information,
      considered with the entirety of the evidence heard at trial, may well have
      left the jury in a state of reasonable doubt as to whether the appellant
      was the person who killed Mr. Roy. However, the compelling nature of his
      confessions – particularly the level of detail and accuracy found in them – prevents
      me from concluding that the admission of the fresh evidence would make
      it “clearly more probable than not”
    that the appellant would be acquitted at a new trial.</span></p>

    trial and the other relating to a jurisprudential factor which, in my view,
    must anchor this court’s assessment of the conduct of these men in 1972.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[255]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    in 1972 Mac Lindsay and Arthur Cogan were young lawyers with promising careers
    and good reputations.  For both of them, the Phillion trial was the first
    murder trial they conducted on their own.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[256]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fortunately,
    they were both able to testify before this court in January 2008.  Both were

    impression of both men is confirmed by what they said about each other. In

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>A.        Certainly
    when I arrived at the office in March of 1968, he had an excellent reputation.  He
    was a very -- a counsel that really kept the interests of his clients at

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Q.        And

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>A.        Yes,
    he would.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[258]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Cogan described Lindsay in a similar vein. He agreed that Mr. Lindsay was
    a Crown counsel with “excellent credibility”.  According to Mr. Cogan, “I
    have known Mr. Lindsay for a long time and he’s had a great career and he’s
    a nice man and he was a fair Crown” and “he had a fine reputation and he’ll
    end his career with a fine reputation.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[259]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    descriptions of both counsel lead me directly to the jurisprudential point
    I want to make.  In <i>R. v. Truscott</i> (2007), 225 C.C.C. (3d) 321, this
    court declined to consider the submission that Truscott’s trial almost 50
    years ago was unfair because the Crown did not disclose crucial information
    to the defence.  This court offered five reasons for declining to consider
    the issue.  Two of those reasons, at paras. 116 and 123-24, are as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Third, the appellant’s
    unfairness claim raises substantial problems of proof.  Most of the people
    who played any significant role in the trial or the first Reference died
    before the disclosure issues were raised.  Those who were available spoke,
    quite understandably, in generalities and surmises rather than based on actual
    recollections of relevant events.  The court is left to speculate about what
    people knew or did not know and what they did or did not do almost fifty
    years ago.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>. . .</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Finally, we
    are concerned that any attempt to assess the merits of the appellant’s unfairness
    claim, and we do not deny that the claim may have merit, could produce its
    own unfairness.  Were we to find on this record that the trial or the first
    Reference was fundamentally unfair because the appellant did not receive
    information essential to his defence that was in the Crown’s possession,
    that finding could well reflect adversely on those responsible for the prosecution
    at trial and on the first Reference.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Any court must
    go where the evidence takes it and decide the issues that must be decided
    even if those decisions do harm to the reputation of otherwise respected
    individuals.  <i>Where, however, the evidentiary record is far from clear
    and the issues do not need to be resolved to do justice in this case, decency

    assessing whether the appellant has established that his trial was rendered

    agree with conclusions (2), (3) and (4).  I agree with my colleague’s legal
    conclusion in (1), that the appellant has failed to meet his burden of establishing
    that Detective McCombie did not discredit the alibi. However, unlike my colleague,
    I do not regard the evidence on this issue as being so evenly balanced that
    it gives rise to a stalemate, thus requiring resort to the default position
    that the onus of proof rests with the appellant.  Rather, although I acknowledge
    that there is strong evidence both ways, three components of the evidence
    lead me to conclude that Detective McCombie did in fact discredit the alibi
    that he referred to in the April 12, 1968 report.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[264]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    based on the entire record, including his testimony in this court in January
    2008, I believe Detective McCombie’s claim that he discredited the alibi,
    but that some 40 years later, the supplementary investigation report he wrote
    describing his trip to
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place

    Trenton and the confirmatory physical evidence he obtained at the service

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[265]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is nothing in the record relating to Detective McCombie’s manner of investigating
    the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Roy murder to suggest that he is lying about this. It should be recalled
    that on August 10, 1967, the day after the murder, Detective McCombie showed
    Mrs.&nbsp;Roy ten photographs and Mrs. Roy selected the photograph of Donald
    Phillion, the appellant’s identical twin brother, as the one most resembling
    the assailant.  Five days later, on August 15, 1967, Mrs. Roy identified
    the appellant when she viewed a line-up at the police station, but later
    expressed some doubt about her identification. Detective McCombie did not
    charge the appellant, which might be regarded as a cautious decision.  Moreover,
    for many months, Detective McCombie diligently pursued the investigation
    wherever it led, including towards other suspects. In addition, in the April
    12, 1968 report, Detective McCombie recorded a verified alibi for the appellant
    in clear and strong language.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[266]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
    on these and many other examples, it cannot be said that Detective McCombie
    showed any signs at all of being out to get Romeo Phillion for the murder
    of Leopold Roy. As expressed by my colleague in his reasons:  “Detective
    McCombie’s even-handed investigation undercuts the notion that he would have
    misled Mr. Lindsay and his fellow officers in order to bring about the prosecution
    of a man he knew to be innocent of the crime.”  My colleague also refers
    to an “impressive body of evidence attesting to Detective McCombie’s distinguished
    career as a police officer and his unblemished reputation for professionalism
    and integrity.”  I would attach more weight to this evidence than does my
    colleague.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[267]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    based on my assessment of the recent testimony of Mac Lindsay, who impressed
    me with his candour and sincerity, and Arthur Cogan, who testified about
    Mr.&nbsp;Lindsay’s professionalism and fine reputation, it defies credulity
    to contemplate that Mr. Lindsay would have allowed a murder prosecution to
    proceed knowing that the lead investigating officer had previously believed
    that the accused had an alibi and that this alibi had not been properly discredited.  This
    conduct would have been a terrible abuse of process and contrary to the professionalism
    and integrity that animated Mr. Lindsay’s entire career as a Crown prosecutor.  As
    expressed by my colleague: “I find it virtually inconceivable that Mr. Lindsay…would
    have participated in prosecuting the appellant for the Roy murder knowing
    that he was innocent of the crime.” Again, I would attach more weight to
    this evidence than does my colleague.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[268]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    there is critical documentary evidence supporting a finding that Detective
    McCombie was satisfied that the Trenton alibi had been fully discredited
    prior to the appellant’s 1972 confession.  In Detective McCombie’s April
    2, 1971 investigation report describing his trip to Archambault Institute
    to question Donald Phillion about the murder, he wrote:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[I]t is still
    the writer’s contention that the person responsible for the murder is Romeo
    Phillion who is a twin brother of Donald and that due to lack of identification
    and other evidence we are unable to proceed with a charge at this time.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo0 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span
class=MsoPageNumber>I cannot conceive of any reason why Detective McCombie would
      have made this strong assertion of his belief in the appellant’s guilt
      in a 1971 investigation report unless sometime after April 12, 1968, he
      had fully satisfied himself that the appellant did not have a verified
      alibi placing him in or near Trenton around the time of the murder.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[269]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My
    conclusion on this issue is thus that Detective McCombie did discredit the
    alibi that he had referred to in his April 12, 1968 report.  Since, as my
    colleague explains, the Crown was not obliged in 1972 to disclose evidence
    of a discredited alibi to the accused, it follows that the appellant received
    a fair trial.</p>

    agree with my colleague that the first and third of these criteria are met
    in this case.  The Crown concedes that the proposed fresh evidence is admissible
    under the operative rules of evidence and, as expressed by my colleague,
    it would be quite wrong to “cast aside the proposed fresh evidence on the
    basis of a lack of due diligence on Mr.&nbsp;Cogan’s part” in 1972.</p>

    leaves the second criterion, the cogency of the fresh evidence.  In <i>Truscott</i>,
    at paras. 99-100, this court explained the nature and purpose of the cogency
    inquiry and the three questions that must be answered in relation to it:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The cogency

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    the evidence is sufficiently cogent to justify its admission on appeal, subject

line-height:normal'>[273]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    noted by my colleague, only the third question is in issue.  He concludes
    that the information contained in the April 12, 1968 report could reasonably
    be expected to have affected the verdict, and thus gives an affirmative answer
    to the cogency question.  With respect, I disagree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    the emphasized passages from the above quotation from <i>Truscott </i>indicate,
    in order to answer the cogency question, the court must engage in a qualitative
    assessment which measures the probative potential of the fresh evidence considered
    together with the evidence heard at the trial.  I am prepared to assume that
    the radio and tow receipt that Detective McCombie claims to have retrieved
    from the Trenton service station and his supplementary investigation report
    describing his trip to Trenton were missing by 1972.  I am also prepared
    to assume that Mr. Cogan would have vigorously cross-examined Detective McCombie
    about his alleged discrediting of the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Trenton alibi in an effort to raise a doubt in the minds of the jury as to
    whether the appellant in fact had the opportunity to commit the murder.  In
    response to this questioning, Detective McCombie’s testimony presumably would
    have been that, more than three years prior, he believed that the appellant
    had an alibi placing him in
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Trenton around the time of the murder.  He then would have gone on to explain
    that he subsequently travelled to the

    <st1:City

    Trenton service station and discredited the alibi and that the documentary
    evidence capable of supporting this discrediting was now missing. </p>

line-height:normal'>[275]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the jury may well have been troubled by the missing documentation, it must
    be pointed out that missing evidence would not have been a new factor for
    the jury to consider in this case.  By the time Detective McCombie testified
    in 1972, his own notes as well as several items of physical evidence that
    police had gathered were also lost.  Mr.&nbsp;Cogan cross-examined Detective
    McCombie at trial about his missing notes and the missing evidence. In Mr.
    Cogan’s closing submissions, he asked the jury to resist a finding that the
    evidence supported the truth of the confession in a case where selected items
    of evidence – the photographic line-up shown to Mrs. Roy, fingernail scrapings,
    blood and hair samples removed from the deceased, as well as a hair sample
    voluntarily provided by the appellant – had been lost.  He also asked the
    jury to look very carefully at the lack of a proper police investigation
    in this case.  Presumably, the jury considered this aspect of the case along
    with all the other evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[276]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    short, in 1972 the jury had to evaluate important aspects of Detective McCombie’s
    testimony without some of the confirmatory evidence he said had existed but
    could no longer produce. The documentary evidence capable of confirming the
    discrediting of the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Trenton alibi would simply have been another item that Mr. Cogan could point
    to in support of his position advanced in closing argument that the jury
    should look critically at why so many items of evidence were lost in this
    case. I am not satisfied that it could reasonably be expected that the jury
    would have reached a different verdict because of the inclusion of this further
    piece of missing evidence. </p>

    addition to concluding that Mr. Cogan could have raised a reasonable doubt
    in the minds of the jury through his cross-examination of Detective McCombie
    on the alleged discrediting of the Trenton alibi, my colleague is of the
    view that the new information in the April 12, 1968 report concerning the
    inconsistent statements of Mr.&nbsp;Barbe, and potentially Mrs. Barbe, when
    combined with Mr. Loyer’s willsay, could also have assisted in raising a
    reasonable doubt.  Again, I am unable to share this view.  </p>

    Barbe did not testify at trial and the jury did not rely on his evidence
    to convict. If Mr. Barbe had testified and been cross-examined on his alleged
    prior statements to Detective McCombie to the effect that he last saw the
    appellant on Tuesday, August 8, 1967 (the night before the murder), his sworn
    evidence at the preliminary inquiry indicates that he would have responded
    that it could not have been Tuesday, August 8 that he last saw the appellant.  He
    would further have explained that his wife always went to bingo on Wednesday
    nights and the night that the appellant spoke to him about selling his car
    was his wife’s bingo night. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[279]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    for Mrs. Barbe, the record does not support my colleague’s assertion that
    if the defence knew the contents of the April 12, 1968 report, Mrs. Barbe
    potentially may have accepted that her last sighting of the appellant was
    on Tuesday, August 8, 1967 and not the night of the murder. While it is true
    that Detective McCombie spoke to her and her husband in August 1967, there
    is no record of what he asked her or how she responded. She may or may not
    have been asked when she last saw the appellant and she may or may not have
    had a different recollection than her husband.  </p>

line-height:normal'>[280]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>W<span lang=EN-US>hat
      is clear from the record is that Mrs. Barbe always anchored her last sighting
      of the appellant by reference to her bingo night. In her recorded statements
      to the police in January 1972 and in her evidence at the preliminary inquiry
      and at the trial, she was unwavering in her assertion that she attended
      bingo on Wednesday nights.  </span>The<span
lang=EN-US> suggestion that Mrs. Barbe told Detective McCombie in August 1967
      that she last saw the appellant on Tuesday, August 8, 1967 is pure speculation

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[281]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    also see no reason to think that Mr. Loyer’s willsay could have assisted
    the defence in prompting Mrs. Barbe to accept that she may have attended
    bingo on a Tuesday rather than a Wednesday night. If anything, his willsay
    provides considerable support for Mrs. Barbe’s recollection that she last
    saw the appellant on August 9, 1967.  Mr. Loyer’s willsay – which was disclosed
    to Mr. Cogan in the Crown Brief – confirmed that his parish held Wednesday
    night bingos, including one on Wednesday, August 9, 1967.  The indication
    in his willsay that another organization usually held bingos on Friday nights,
    but moved them to Tuesday nights in July and August, could not reasonably
    be expected to have changed the Barbes’ testimony that Mrs. Barbe played
    bingo on Wednesday nights.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[282]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Another
    factor to consider in assessing the cogency of the April 12, 1968 report
    is whether Mr. Cogan would have conceded his client’s presence in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Ottawa on the day of the murder if he had known about the once verified and
    later discredited alibi.  My colleague is unequivocal on this point: “he
    would not have made that concession had he been aware of the substance of
    the April 12, 1968 report.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[283]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    make two observations about this conclusion.  First, if Mr. Cogan had been
    made aware of the substance of the April 12, 1968 report, he also would have
    been informed about Detective McCombie’s claim that he discredited the alibi
    recorded in this report.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[284]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    my review of the trial transcript suggests that the reason Mr. Cogan conceded
    his client’s presence in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Ottawa on the day of the murder was not because he did not know of the once
    confirmed and later discredited
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Trenton alibi.  Rather, it was because he wanted to ensure that the jury
    would not hear Mrs. Barbe’s testimony regarding a conversation the appellant
    had had with her husband on the night of the murder in which he said he wanted
    to sell his car and leave town. As Mr. Cogan put it in his submissions to
    the trial judge, he was concerned that if the jury heard this “very prejudicial” evidence,
    they might conclude that his client had a motive to break into an apartment
    building, or infer that he was the kind of man who would commit murder. Mr.&nbsp;Cogan’s
    knowledge of a once confirmed and later discredited alibi would not, in my
    view, have changed the deal he made with Mr. Lindsay in 1972 to avoid this
    aspect of Mrs. Barbe’s testimony. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[285]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So
    far, I have attempted to suggest that the cogency of the information relating
    to the April 12, 1968 report is less compelling than my colleague asserts

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[286]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    in my opinion, the significance of these factors pales in comparison to one
    factor that overwhelms the others in the assessment of the cogency criterion.  It
    is the tidal wave on the horizon.  It is a factor that sweeps all the others
    aside, yet is mentioned only briefly in my colleague’s cogency analysis.  This
    factor is the appellant’s confession.</p>

    appellant’s response to this remarkably long, specific and accurate list
    of assertions is two-fold: first, that he was always obsessed with the Roy
    murder, having been a suspect early on in the investigation; and second,
    that all of his accurate assertions in the confession had been reported in
    the local press and thus were known to him through outside sources.  Hence
    his confession was false.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[295]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    only evidence of the appellant’s obsession with the case is that he came
    to the police station almost four years after the murder and told Detective
    McCombie that his twin brother, Donald, who was already serving a life sentence
    for a different murder, wanted to confess to the
    <st1:place

    Roy murder.  Detective McCombie went to Archambault Institute in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Montreal and Donald denied his brother’s claim. This exceptional event strikes
    me as evidence of lying and disloyalty, but not of obsession.  </p>

line-height:normal'>[296]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    for the appellant’s submission that he learned the details of the murder
    through a newspaper article, which appeared in the <i>Ottawa Journal</i> on
    the day after the murder (the appellant had left Ottawa by then) and which
    included certain facts about the murder, I might be impressed by the appellant’s
    submission if the confession had been made 4 ½ hours or 4 ½ days or even
    4 ½ weeks after the murder. However, the appellant confessed some 4 ½ years
    later. In this context, it strains credulity to think that the number of
    accurate assertions (20), the level of detail provided in them (for example,
    that Mr. Roy had grabbed him), and even the mundaneness of the assertions
    in the confession (for example, he had seen the victim cutting grass) flowed
    from him having read, and remembered for 4 ½ years, details found in a newspaper
    article. Moreover, there is simply no evidence in the record to suggest that
    the police or anyone else told the appellant details about the murder at
    any time.</p>

    the accurate details in the confession, my colleague goes on to state that “many
    of them were reported by the press and thus they were in the public domain.”  However,
    the newspaper account of the murder that the appellant relied on in argument
    was an article in the <i>Ottawa Journal</i> that appeared on the day after
    the murder.  The appellant was not in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City

    Ottawa that day.  Moreover, his confession occurred 4 ½ years after the murder,
    which is a long period of time for a person to remember numerous and highly

    275 Friel Street and states that “standing alone, that feature of the confession
    could leave a jury wary about the veracity and reliability of the confession
    as a whole.”  With respect, I disagree.  At the trial in 1972, the jury had
    before it all of the evidence about the confession – the circumstances leading
    up to it, its contents, Neil Miller’s confirmation that the appellant had
    also confessed to him, and the expert evidence about the falsity of his confession.  The
    jury obviously found that the confession was true.  In doing so, they must
    have considered and attached little weight to the assertions relating to
    the break-in and theft, which they knew were inaccurate.  Standing alone,
    that feature of the confession did not lead the jury to reject the veracity
    and reliability of the confession as a whole.  Nothing in the record has
    changed on this issue.</p>

    murdering Leopold Roy in August 1967.  The jury had before it his confession
    and the circumstances giving rise to it.  The jury heard Mr. Miller’s evidence
    confirming the confession.  Finally, the jury heard the expert evidence called
    by the defence to the effect that the confession was false and should not
    be believed.  The jury considered all this evidence and found the appellant

    to a once verified and later discredited alibi, and relating to the statements
    of the Barbes and Mr. Loyer, does not change this picture.  This evidence
    could not reasonably be expected to have affected the result.  Accordingly,
