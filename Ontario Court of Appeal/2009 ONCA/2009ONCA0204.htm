    appellant, Setsuko Stefanou (the “wife”), appeals from the judgment of Herman
    J. dated February 13, 2008 on the trial of an issue, namely, whether Greece
    or Ontario was the more appropriate forum for the adjudication of the wife’s
    claims for equalization of net family property and spousal support in matrimonial
    proceedings.  The trial judge held that
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario was a <i>forum non conveniens</i> for the proceedings and, accordingly,
    that the appropriate forum was
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Greece</st1:country-region>
    , where the parties had habitually resided from 1993 to the date of their
    separation in 2004.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    main issue on the appeal is whether the fresh evidence – the application
    filed by George Stefanou (the “husband”) in matrimonial proceedings he initiated
    in Greece after the trial decision in Ontario – should be admitted and, further,
    whether it should serve as a basis for allowing the appeal to set aside the
    trial judge’s decision in favour of an order that the matrimonial proceedings
    continue in Ontario.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the conclusion of the appeal hearing, this court allowed the appeal on the
    basis of the fresh evidence only, with reasons to follow.  These are the
    reasons.</p>

    from
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Greece</st1:country-region>

    from
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region

    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto in 1979.    They both subsequently became Canadian citizens.</p>

    Toronto in 1979,

    Nova Scotia from 1980 to 1982,

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Germany</st1:country-region>
    from 1986 to 1993.  The wife quit her job and accompanied the husband on
    all of these postings.  She was not employed during these years.  Throughout
    this period, the parties regarded
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto as their home base.  There were no children of the marriage.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    1993, the husband retired and the parties’ primary residence became the

    Rhodes in
    <st1:place w:st="on">

 w:st="on">Greece</st1:country-region>
    .  The parties had a home, to which they made substantial improvements, and
    also owned an olive grove and a vineyard on the island.  They spent about
    one month a year in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto, where they stayed with the husband’s sister and brother-in-law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    2004, the parties separated.  The husband initiated divorce proceedings in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Greece</st1:country-region>
    in February 2005.  The wife did not contest these proceedings and the divorce
    was granted by a Greek court in May 2006.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    April 2005, the wife brought an application in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario for equalization of net family property and spousal support.  The
    parties’ property consists of the home, land, and a yacht in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Greece</st1:country-region>
    , as well as bank accounts and investments in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    and the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>
    worth approximately $2,000,000.  Most of the money located in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    has been frozen by a series of court orders, many of which were made on consent
    of both parties.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    September 2005, the husband brought a motion to dismiss the wife’s claims
    on the basis that
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario did not have jurisdiction <i>simpliciter</i> and was a <i>forum non
    conveniens</i> for the matrimonial proceedings.  Paisley J. ordered the trial
    of an issue.  However, on the eve thereof, the husband abandoned the issue
    of jurisdiction <i>simpliciter.</i></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>            (2) <u>The litigation</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Herman
    J. presided over the trial of an issue.  Early in her judgment, she pointed
    out that the parties agreed that the property issues are governed by the
    laws of
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Greece</st1:country-region>
    .  This is so because of s. 15 of the <i>Family Law Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990,
    c. F. 3, which provides, in part, that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[t]he property rights of spouses arising out of
    the marital relationship are governed by the internal law of the place <i>where
    both spouses had their last common habitual residence</i>….[Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    parties do not dispute that between 1993 and their separation in 2004, their “last
    common habitual residence” was
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Greece</st1:country-region>
    .</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge then reviewed and applied the various factors set out by Sharpe
    J.A., writing for this court in <i>Muscutt v. Courcelles</i> (2002), 60 O.R.
    (3d) 20, for determining the issue of <i>forum non conveniens</i>.  After
    balancing these factors, the trial judge concluded as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>On weighing these factors, it is my opinion that
    the balance tips in favour of this matter proceeding in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Greece</st1:country-region>
    .  In coming to this conclusion, I do not want to minimize Ms. Stefanou’s
    sincerity in not wanting this matter to proceed in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Greece</st1:country-region>
    .  I accept that it may be difficult for her.  However, a determination of
    the value of the Greek properties and Ms. Stefanou’s contribution to them
    is a more complicated issue from an evidentiary standpoint than is the other
    major issue in dispute, that is, whether there was a loan to Mr. Stefanou’s
    brother-in-law.  Added to this is the fact that an
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario court would have to apply Greek law in order to determine Ms. Stefanou’s
    interest in these properties.  Finally, the jurisdiction of the Greek court
    to deal with both property and spousal support claims in clear.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the trial judge granted the husband’s motion and stayed the wife’s application
    in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario.  She also ordered a continuation of the freeze on the parties’ assets
    in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    North America “until and unless the parties agree otherwise or until further
    order of a court of competent jurisdiction.”  Finally, in a costs endorsement
    dated April 7, 2008, the trial judge awarded the husband costs fixed at $45,000,
    inclusive of GST and disbursements.  However, she suspended the payment of
    those costs until “the parties’ respective interests have been determined”,
    presumably at the conclusion of the proceedings in the Greek courts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    wife appeals from the trial judge’s <i>forum non conveniens</i> ruling.  The

    of the costs award until the conclusion of the case.</p>

    judge’s decision was released in

    wife submits that, in so doing, the trial judge not only made findings that
    conflicted with the evidence or which were based on a misapprehension of
    the evidence, but also made several processing errors in assessing the evidence
    that affected the result. More specifically, the wife submits that the trial
    judge considered evidence in error, reached a conclusion that was not based
    logically on her own findings, and gave inappropriate weight to the evidence

    before the trial judge in the

    that these new developments meet all of the criteria set out in <i>R. v.</i> <i>Palmer</i>,
    [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759, for the admission of fresh evidence.  Simply put, the
    wife’s submission is that if the trial judge had known then what this court
    can see now, her decision on the <i>forum non conveniens</i> issue would
    invariably have been different.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree.  The difference between the husband’s position about the marriage
    and property issues before the trial judge in Ontario in December 2007 and
    his position about those same issues in his April 2008 application in the
    Greek court is, in my view, quantitatively significant and, quite frankly,
    qualitatively shocking.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the trial of the issue in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario, the husband’s position encompassed the following propositions:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal;'>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>The parties
    had a very good marriage for 25 years, except for disagreements about money.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>There
    was no live issue with respect to the approximately $2,000,000 in various
    bank and investment accounts in North America, except for a dispute involving
    the husband’s withdrawal of approximately $169,000 from the parties’ joint
    bank account between August 2004 and February 2005 purportedly to repay his
    brother-in-law for a loan.  According to the husband, he should keep the
    money in his personal accounts, his wife should keep the money in her personal
    accounts, and, in the husband’s words, “it’s a better idea to split the joint
    account in half”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>“The <i>only</i> dispute” between
    the parties related to the Greek property owned by the husband.  However,
    even on that issue, the husband acknowledged that the parties made substantial
    improvements to the property and that the wife was entitled to something
    in respect of her contribution to the improvements.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'>(4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>The
    wife should receive half of the value of the jointly owned yacht.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Less
    than five months later, in April 2008, in his application for corollary relief
    in the Greek court<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

    propositions:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>The
    wife caused the deterioration of the marriage relationship.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>The
    husband is entitled to all the money in his personal accounts, the wife’s
    personal accounts, and their joint accounts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>The
    husband is the owner of the Greek property and the wife contributed nothing
    to the improvements.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='

    wife is not entitled to half of the value of the yacht.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    test for the admission of fresh evidence on appeal involves a consideration
    of four criteria: see <i>Palmer</i> at p. 775.  All four criteria must be
    satisfied in order for this court to admit the fresh evidence.  These criteria
    are as follows:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>Could
    the evidence have been adduced at trial with due diligence?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>Is
    the evidence relevant, in the sense that it bears upon a decisive or potentially
    decisive issue in the trial?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>Is
    the evidence credible, in the sense that it is reasonably capable of belief?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'>(4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp; </span>If
    believed, could the evidence reasonably, when taken with the other evidence
    adduced at trial, be expected to have affected the result at trial?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    husband’s application in the Greek court was made almost five months after
    the trial in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario and therefore could not possibly have been adduced at trial.  The
    evidence is clearly relevant, as it relates to the same property that was
    in issue in the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario trial.  The evidence is also credible – it is found in a sworn court
    document and there is no suggestion that the husband is not responsible for
    its contents.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    leaves only the fourth <i>Palmer</i> criterion.  In my view, it is obvious
    that, when taken with the other evidence adduced at trial, the fresh evidence
    could reasonably have affected the result at the trial.  In the trial judge’s
    analysis, the <i>Muscutt</i> factors were quite evenly balanced.  The trial
    judge expressly recognized that her decision on the <i>forum non conveniens</i> issue
    was a close one and stated near the end of her reasons that “the balance
    tips in favour of this matter proceeding in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Greece</st1:country-region>
    .”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    her application of the <i>forum non conveniens </i>factors, the trial judge
    singled out the need to value the Greek properties (favouring Greece as the
    appropriate forum) and the loan to the husband’s brother-in-law (favouring
    Ontario).  She chose to emphasize the former, in part because it was agreed
    that Greek law would have to be applied to determine the wife’s interest
    in the Greek properties.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    fresh evidence tendered does not change the requirement that Greek law govern
    the determination of the property issues in this litigation.  However, it
    has radically changed the parameters of the property issues.  Although the
    Greek home and land are still in play, with an estimated combined value in
    the hundreds of thousands of dollars, in light of the husband’s pleadings
    in the Greek court the more significant property issue is now the roughly
    $2,000,000 in various North American bank and investment accounts.  There
    can be no question that, in addition to the quantum involved, a need will
    invariably arise, if the parties continue to disagree about who had responsibility
    for retaining their investment advisor and for overseeing their financial
    affairs, to hear evidence from bank officials, accountants, tax advisers
    and officials, and perhaps other experts, to determine this issue.  Because
    the money is located in Canadian financial institutions, nearly all of the
    evidence will likely come from witnesses in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    .</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, in these new circumstances, the balance tips heavily in favour of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario as the appropriate forum for resolving the parties’ property issues.  Moreover,
    in my view, the new state of affairs is so different from that which was
    before the trial judge, that it is appropriate for this court to dispose
    of the matter on the basis of the record before us, rather than order a new
    trial of the issue: see <i>R. v. Stolar</i>, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 480, at p. 492.  Accordingly,
    I would conclude that
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario is the appropriate forum for dealing with the property issues in
    this matrimonial litigation.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,

    would also reverse the trial judge’s costs order and award the wife her costs
    of the trial fixed at $45,000 inclusive of GST and disbursements, also payable
    out of the husband’s share of the frozen funds.</p>
