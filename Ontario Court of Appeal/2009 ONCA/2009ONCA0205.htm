    is an application brought under s. 680(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C.
    1985, c. C-46, seeking an order directing a review of the detention order
    made by McGarry J. on September 19<sup>th</sup>, 2008.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    applicant was charged in 2007 in an information alleging conspiracy to commit
    murder, attempted murder and aggravated assault.  As a result of the conspiracy
    charge, the applicant bore the onus of establishing that he could be released
    into the community pending his trial.  The applicant originally sought bail
    in July of 2007.  At that time, McGarry J. refused interim release, ruling
    that the applicant had failed to satisfy his onus on both the secondary and
    tertiary grounds set out in s. 515(10) of the <i>Code</i>.  A fresh application
    based on a material change in circumstances was brought before McGarry J.
    in August 2008 and as indicated he dismissed the application in September
    2008.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    this application for review, the applicant suggests that McGarry J. made
    five errors in dismissing his second application for interim release.  He
    submits that the application judge erred in: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1)        articulating the onus applicable to the  application; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2)        appreciating the nature of the proceedings; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3)        assessing the new evidence;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>4)        failing to give adequate reasons for
    his decision; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>5)        failing to apply the <i>Gladue</i> principles
    to the issue of whether the applicant could be released on bail.</p>
  <h3>1.         The Onus of Proof</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    applicant submits that the application judge erred in articulating the proper
    onus of proof on the application.  This argument has no merit.  At para.
    37 of his decision, the application judge mentioned that the charge involved
    attempted murder and seemed to suggest that this created a reverse onus on
    the bail hearing.  Of course, it is the conspiracy to commit murder charge
    that created the reverse onus in this case.  There was no dispute between
    the parties that the onus was upon the applicant to show cause as to why
    he could be released.  Additionally, the three charges relate to a single
    transaction, and in the circumstances before the application judge and before
    me, the evidence in relation to conspiracy appears to be at least as strong
    as the evidence in relation to the other two charges.  It is clear that the
    application judge simply misspoke in a way that had no impact on the proceedings.</p>
  <h3>2.         The Nature of Proceedings</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the court below, the Crown took the position that the application judge had
    no jurisdiction to hear the second application for bail based on a material
    change in circumstances.  While the issue was not raised before me, I am
    of the view that the application judge did not err in ruling that he had
    jurisdiction to entertain the application.  See for example: <i>R. v. Daniels </i>(1997),
    119 C.C.C. (3d) 413 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    );<i> R. v. Boyle</i>, 2006 CanLII 42662 (ON
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    )<i>.</i> </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    me, the applicant submitted that the application judge misapprehended the
    nature of the proceedings when he concluded that the fresh application was
    not an entirely <i>de novo</i> hearing.  In my view this position is not
    consistent with the authorities.  A second application for interim release
    does not take place in a vacuum.  The test for bringing such an application
    is whether there has been a material change in circumstances from those that
    existed at the time of the original application.  As stated by this court
    in <i>Daniels</i> at para. 39: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Where the second application is brought before
    the judge who heard the first application, there can be no suggestion of judge
    shopping, nor can it appear that one judge of the court is effectively sitting
    on appeal from a decision of another judge of the court. In addition, the
    judge who heard the first application is in the best position to decide the
    significance, if any, of the alleged change in circumstances since the first
    application. That judge should also be able to dispose of the application
    more expeditiously than would a judge who has no prior familiarity with the
    matter.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    light of these comments, I am of the view that such subsequent applications
    for interim release are not completely <i>de novo</i> proceedings based on
    entirely separate evidence, independent of and without reference to the evidence
    and reasons given on the original application.  Rather, such subsequent applications
    provide an opportunity for the application judge to reconsider and reassess
    the evidence, as well as his or her original decision, in light of the impact
    of a significant or material change in circumstances or new or altered evidence.  This
    is how the application judge approached the matter.  He did not err in this
    approach.</p>
  <h3>3.         The Change in Circumstances</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    applicant identified two changes in circumstances that he submitted would
    have justified the application judge vacating his earlier decision and granting
    judicial interim release to the applicant.  First, he submitted that the
    evidence led at the preliminary inquiry demonstrated that the Crowns case
    was weaker than put forward at the original bail hearing.  Notably, the applicant
    pointed to a time discrepancy in the evidence of the main Crown witness,
    which suggested that the offence occurred at least one hour later than originally
    claimed.  While the time discrepancy is favourable to the defence, the main
    thrust of the evidence of that witness remains unchanged.  Further, there
    is substantial independent evidence supporting the Crowns theory of events.  The
    application judge recognized that there had been a change in evidentiary
    record but nevertheless held that the Crowns case was still very strong.  On
    the record before me, there is no likelihood that a panel of this court would
    disagree with his assessment in this regard.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second material change raised by counsel for the applicant was the proffering
    of a new release plan involving a new surety and virtual house arrest.  At
    the original bail hearing, the application judge ruled that the applicant
    had not met the onus placed upon him on both the secondary and tertiary grounds.  There
    was evidence before him that could and did give rise to concerns on both
    the secondary and tertiary grounds.  Specifically, the applicants testimony
    at the original bail hearing could be described as unimpressive at best.  Certainly,
    the application judge was fully justified in finding that the applicant,
    on the basis of his own evidence, was not likely to be amenable to any significant
    level of control over his activities.  While the sureties originally proposed
    were fine upstanding citizens and sincere in their desire to assist the applicant,
    the application judge was not satisfied that they could exercise the level
    of control over the applicant so as to satisfy his concerns on the secondary
    grounds. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    new release plan involved house arrest under the control of a new surety.  However
    that surety had had little contact with the applicant for over 13 years.  The
    evidence did not support a finding that the new surety could address the
    application judges concerns that the applicant was not likely to be amenable
    to such supervision of his conduct. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    I am satisfied that the changes put forward by the defence did not materially
    alter the circumstances in relation to the analysis of the tertiary grounds.  I
    am satisfied that there is no likelihood that a panel of this court would
    find that the application judge erred on either the secondary or tertiary
    grounds.  </p>
  <h3>4.         Failure to Give Adequate Reasons</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    applicant submitted that the application judge failed to adequately articulate
    the reasons for his decision on the second application, as required in <i>R.
    v. Sheppard</i>, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 869.   There is no merit in this argument.  In
    light of the nature of the proceedings, the reasons given on the second application
    must be read against the background and in conjunction with the application
    judges earlier reasons for denying the applicants bail request.  When read
    together, these sets of reasons more than adequately outlined the basis for
    the ruling.  However, even when read separately, the application judges
    reasons on the second application provide sufficient explanation to the applicant
    for his continued detention. </p>
  <h3>5.         Failure to Apply <i>Gladue</i> Principles</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is common ground that principles enunciated in the decision of the Supreme
    Court of Canada in <i>R. v. Gladue</i>, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 688,<i> </i>have
    application to the question of bail.  However, the application judge cannot
    apply such principles in a vacuum.  Application of the <i>Gladue</i> principles
    would involve consideration of the unique systemic or background factors
    which may have played a part in bringing the particular aboriginal offender
    before the courts.  The exercise would involve consideration of the types
    of release plans, enforcement or control procedures and sanctions that would,
    because of his or her particular aboriginal heritage or connections, be appropriate
    in the circumstances of the offender and would satisfy the primary, secondary
    and tertiary grounds for release.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Notwithstanding
    that the applicant is a lawyer and was represented by counsel nothing was
    tendered to assist the application judge in any such analysis.  It appears
    that the matter was only raised in final submissions.  While the applicant
    testified and evidence was also introduced from other aboriginal persons,
    none of that evidence touched on matters that would inform a <i>Gladue</i> analysis.  In
    the absence of such evidence, and in the circumstances of this case, I am
    satisfied that there is no basis to direct a review by a panel of the court
    on this ground.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    the applicant is able to adduce evidence relevant to <i>Gladue</i> principles
    that would amount to a material change in circumstances, there is nothing
    to preclude him from bringing a fresh application on that basis.  However,
    I note that the Supreme Court in <i>Gladue</i>, in the context of sentencing,
    stated at para. 79 that the more violent and serious the offence the more
    likely it is as a practical reality that the terms of imprisonment for aboriginals
    and non aboriginals will be close to each other or the same.  I would think
    that the same practical reality would apply to applications for judicial
    interim release.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    conclusion, the applicant has not satisfied me that I should make an order
    referring this matter to a panel of this court for review.  The application
    is dismissed. </p>
