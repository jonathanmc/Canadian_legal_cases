    question of law is this:  When a promise to appear is rendered a nullity
    by non-compliance with the requirement in s. 505 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> that

style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Part
    XVI of the <i>Criminal Code</i> sets out a detailed procedural scheme governing
    the laying of criminal charges and the arrest, detention and release of persons
    charged with criminal offences.  Among other purposes, Part XVI seeks to
    minimize, to the extent consistent with the public interest, the pre-trial
    incarceration of persons charged with criminal offences.  To achieve that
    goal, several provisions of Part XVI permit a peace officer to release an
    individual, thereby avoiding the need to hold that person in custody pending
    appearance before a judicial officer:  see <i>Criminal Code</i>, ss. 496,
    498, 499, 503(2).   </p>

    to appear.<a

    in court on a specified date in answer to the charge set out in the promise
    to appear:  <i>Criminal Code</i>, s. 501.  Failure to appear as required
    is a criminal offence:  <i>Criminal Code</i>, s. 145(5).<a href="#_ftn2"

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If
    an accused is released on a promise to appear, two steps are necessary to
    bring the criminal charges before the court.  First, an information alleging
    the offence(s) must be laid before a justice “as soon as practicable” and “in
    any event before the time stated in the … promise to appear”:  <i>Criminal
    Code</i>, s. 505.  Failure to lay the information “as soon as practicable” renders
    the promise to appear ineffective and provides a defence to a charge of failure
    to appear as directed by the promise to appear:  <i>R. v. Naylor</i> (1978),
    42 C.C.C. (2d) 12 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 19;  <i>R. v. Gougeon</i> (1980), 55
    C.C.C. (2d) 218 (Ont. C.A.), at pp. 230-31, leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused
    35 N.R. 83n; <i>R. v. Markovic</i> (2005), 77 O.R. (3d) 752 (C.A.), at paras.
    23-25, leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [2005] S.C.C.A. No. 530.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    second step necessary to move the criminal charges forward also takes place
    when the information is laid before the justice of the peace.  The justice
    of the peace must decide whether to confirm or cancel the promise to appear.  If
    he or she cancels the promise to appear, it is of no force and effect, the
    accused is not required to appear at the time and place set out in the promise
    to appear, and failure to appear is not a criminal offence.  A justice of
    the peace may cancel a promise to appear for various reasons.  For example,
    the justice of the peace may conclude that the criminal charge(s) should
    not have been brought against the accused, or that some other process should
    be used to compel the attendance of the accused:  <i>Criminal Code</i>, s.
    508.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although
    the promise to appear and other similar mechanisms for release by the police
    introduced into the <i>Criminal Code</i> by the <i>Bail Reform Act</i>, S.C.
    1970-72 c. 37, gave the police broad powers of release, those powers were
    deficient in that they did not permit the police to impose conditions as
    a term of the release.  Unless the police were satisfied that the arrested
    person should be released without any conditions, they had to detain that
    person pending appearance before a justice of the peace.  The justice of
    the peace could then release that individual on the appropriate bail conditions.  This
    shortcoming was eventually cured by amendments that gave a peace officer
    who released the person on a promise to appear, the power to require that
    person to enter into an undertaking before being released:  <i>Criminal Code</i>,
    s. 503(2).  That undertaking could contain one or more of the conditions
    set out in s. 503(2.1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> and is aptly described
    as
    “police bail”:  see Gary T. Trotter, <i>The Law of Bail in Canada</i>, 2nd
    ed. (Scarborough, ON:  Carswell, 1999), at pp. 94-100.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent in the present case was released on a promise to appear issued
    in respect of a charge of assaulting a police officer and a charge of refusing
    to provide a roadside breath sample.  At the time of his release, he entered
    into an undertaking.  One condition of that undertaking required him to abstain
    from the consumption of alcohol.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    prosecution failed to lay an information containing the charges set out in
    the promise to appear “as soon as practicable”, thereby rendering the promise
    to appear ineffective.  The respondent, however, appeared on the date set
    out in the promise to appear and on subsequent dates as ordered by the court.  Subsequent
    to his first appearance, the police encountered the respondent, concluded
    he had been drinking, and charged him with breaching the term of his undertaking
    that required him to abstain from the consumption of alcohol.<a

    trial, the respondent argued that just as with the promise to appear, the
    undertaking was rendered a nullity when the prosecution failed to lay an
    information “as soon as practicable” as required by s. 505.  The respondent
    submitted that because of the failure to comply with s. 505, the undertaking
    was not in effect on the date he was alleged to have breached it.  This was
    the only defence advanced at trial.  Crown and defence agreed that if the
    respondent’s argument carried the day, he should be acquitted and if the
    argument failed, he should be convicted.  The trial judge accepted the argument
    and acquitted the respondent.</p>

    the appropriate order at the end of these reasons.  </p>

      raises a matter of criminal procedure of general importance to the day-to-day
      administration of criminal justice.  Counsel for the respondent did not
      suggest that the Crown’s position was not arguable.  For the reasons I
      will develop, I think it is much more than arguable:  <i>R. v. R. (R.)</i> (2008),

      facts are straightforward.  On July 22, 2004, the respondent was arrested
      on charges of assaulting a police officer and failing to provide a roadside
      breath sample.  He was released that night by a peace officer on a promise
      to appear.  The promise to appear required him to attend court in answer
      to the charges on August 26, 2004.  At the time of his release, the respondent
      entered into an undertaking.  That undertaking included the condition that
      the respondent abstain from the consumption of alcohol.  </span></p>

      would appear from the face of the information that the promise to appear

      Crown agreed that on the authorities, that failure rendered the promise

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>The scheme of Part XVI of the <i>Code</i> illustrates clearly that
      the Promise to Appear and the Undertaking are in essence a single release
      document – one setting out the attendance requirements and the other setting
      out the conditions or restrictions.  It makes sense that the Undertaking
      can only remain in existence as long as the Promise to Appear remains valid.  </span></p>

      information “as soon as practicable” as required by s. 505 did not affect
      jurisdiction over the offence, but led only to a loss of jurisdiction over
      the accused.  He reasoned, however, that the respondent’s subsequent attendance
      in court, while sufficient to restore jurisdiction over the person on the

      measure of control over an accused’s conduct while the criminal proceedings

      jurisdiction over the offences on which the respondent had been released
      on his undertaking and jurisdiction over the respondent.  The allegations
      were making their way through the process presumably to an adjudication
      on their merits.  The justification for the undertaking in the first place – to

      undertaking cannot survive if the charges giving rise to the undertaking
      are no longer before the court.  As indicated above, no one suggests that
      the charges on which the respondent was released on his undertaking were
      not properly before the court as of September 9. There may be cases where
      non-compliance with a provision or provisions in Part XVI of the <i>Criminal
      Code</i> raises a genuine question as to whether a charge on which a person
      was released on an undertaking was still before the courts as of the date
      of the alleged breach of the undertaking.  That is not this case.  It would

      promise to appear is ineffective unless an information is laid in compliance
      with s. 505 and the promise to appear is confirmed by a justice of the
      peace pursuant to s. 508.  These requirements reflect the policy that no
      person should be compelled to attend court in answer to a criminal charge
      unless the judicial officer has reviewed that charge and determined that
      the accused should be required to come to court.  The legal enforceability
      of the promise to appear depends on placing an information before a justice
      of the peace in compliance with s. 505 and the confirmation of the appearance
      notice in compliance with s. 508.  The accused’s legal obligation to attend
      court in compliance with the promise to appear, therefore, does not crystallize
