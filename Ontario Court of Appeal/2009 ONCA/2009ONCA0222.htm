  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Strangers
    to this litigation had a dream of constructing town homes and a retirement
    apartment residence on lands adjacent to

    Ontario (the “project”).  They incorporated Emmanuel Village Homes (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Kitchener) Inc. (“EVH”) as a vehicle for realising that dream.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    late 1999 or early 2000, EVH had run into financial difficulty and accumulated
    $2,000,000.00 of debt. The EVH Board of Directors hired Brain Hunking, as
    a consultant, to help with the project.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    the end of 2000, Hunking had agreed to buy the EVH shares and assume responsibility
    for financing and completing the project.  As Hunking was employed fulltime
    elsewhere, he sought someone to be his ‘eyes and ears’ on the site, and was
    introduced to Robert Seip.  Hunking employed Robert Seip to assist, as a
    consultant, on a short-term basis for the spring and summer of 2001.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    original agreement between Hunking and Robert Seip was oral.  It was made
    more formal pursuant to a letter dated April 3, 2001, which Robert Seip drafted.  At
    the time, Robert Seip was operating as a sole proprietorship under the name
    and style of Seip &amp; Associates.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    the autumn of 2001, it had been decided that the town homes and the retirement
    apartment residence would be operated as two distinct business entities.  Consequently,
    title to the property was severed and, on October 25, 2001, Emmanuel Village
    Residence Inc. (“EVR”) was incorporated.  EVH conveyed to EVR, title to the
    retirement apartment residence and the property on which it stood.  The intent
    was that EVH would operate the town homes and EVR would operate the retirement
    apartment residence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Shortly
    before, on about October 14, 2001, Robert Seip presented Hunking with a draft
    agreement that he had personally prepared (the “Original Draft Agreement”).  Robert
    Seip is not a lawyer.  He prepared the Original Draft Agreement with the
    intent that it would govern a long-term relationship between him and the
    then-unnamed entity or entities that owned the project’s lands and premises.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Hunking
    consulted a lawyer about the Original Draft Agreement.  The lawyer produced
    a different draft agreement (the “McGowan draft”).  Hunking presented Robert
    Seip with the McGowan draft in December 2001.  Robert Seip flatly rejected
    it.  He insisted that the Original Draft Agreement be used but agreed to
    make certain revisions to it.  Robert Seip then prepared a further draft.  The
    revisions were made in italicized type.      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    January 2002, Emmanuel Village Management (“EVM”) was incorporated for the
    purpose of being a signatory to the agreement. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    revised agreement was executed on February 5, 2002 (the

    Seip placed his signature next to the words “Seip

    sole officer, director, shareholder and employee.  Hunking signed next to
    the words “Emmanuel Village Management Inc.” on that same page.  Hunking
    is the principal of EVM, EVH and EVR.              </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Under
    the terms of the Contract, Seip was to provide consulting services during
    the construction phase of the project and management services thereafter.  The
    Contract stipulated that it was to commence on January 1, 2002.  The “Initial
    Term” was defined as a term of 5 years, beginning on January 1, 2002.  The
    Contract could be indefinitely renewed by means of extensions.  “Secondary
    Term” was defined as the term subsequent to the Initial Term plus any extensions
    thereof.  Seip was to be paid a flat monthly fee of $6,000 while providing
    consulting services and then, when providing management services, a percentage
    of gross income from the project, subject to a minimum of $6,000 per month.          </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    December 1, 2004, in anticipation of the project’s sale to a third party,
    Hunking terminated the Contract.  The Contract provides that the owner may
    sell the facility but that the Contract will survive any such sale and the
    purchaser is obliged to deliver written acknowledgement of its agreement
    to assume, on a joint and several liability basis, the liabilities and obligations
    of the owner.  Hunking made no effort to have the third party purchaser assume
    the Contract.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Seip
    sued EVM, EVH and EVR (the “defendants”) for damages for breach of contract.  It
    also sought punitive damages, based on allegations that Hunking told numerous
    third parties that the Contract had been terminated for cause, including
    Seip’s poor or improper management.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    basic thrust of the defence was that the Contract had been terminated for
    cause.  The defendants maintained this position until the eve of trial.  In
    addition, the defendants contended that EVH and EVR were not bound by the
    Contract because neither was party to it.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    a three-day trial, the trial judge found that the defendants had breached
    the Contract.  By judgment dated January 18, 2008, (the “Judgment”), the
    court ordered the defendants to pay Seip the principal sum of $458,193, plus
    pre-judgment and post-judgment interest.  In a supplementary judgment dated
    February 8, 2008, (the “Supplementary Judgment”) the amounts of pre-judgment
    and post-judgment interest were fixed and the defendants were ordered to
    pay those sums in addition to costs, on a partial indemnity basis, of $68,000. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defendants appeal.  They argue that the Contract was not enforceable against
    EVR, a non-party, and that damages were not properly quantified.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Seip
    cross-appealed.  However, at the oral hearing of the appeal, it advised the
    court that it did not intend to pursue the cross-appeal.<b> </b> </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE TRIAL DECISION </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    several places in the Contract, EVH and EVM are listed by name and described
    as the “Owner”.  However, on the signature page, there is a signature line
    for only EVM.  In the trial judge’s view, despite the fact that only EVM
    appeared on the signature page, there was “no doubt”
    that Seip had contracted with both EVM and EVH and that Hunking had signed
    the Contract on behalf of both.  Accordingly, he found that EVM and EVH were
    parties to the Contract.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>EVR
    was not named in the Contract.  In determining whether EVR was bound by the
    Contract, the trial judge began by considering article 11.2 of the Contract.  Article
    11.2 states that the owner may sell the project “provided that such sale
    is made expressly in accordance with and subject to” the Contract.  It goes
    on to provide that such a sale does not relieve the owner of its liabilities
    and obligations under the Contract and that the purchaser “shall” deliver
    to Seip a written acknowledgment of its agreement to assume, on a joint and
    several basis with the owner, the liabilities and obligations of the owner
    under the Contract.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    EVH had conveyed the retirement apartment residence to EVR, the trial judge
    concluded that article 11.2 did not have the effect of binding EVR to the
    Contract because EVR had never made a written acknowledgement in accordance
    with the provisions of article 11.2.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the trial judge went on to find that EVR subsequently bound itself to the
    Contract through its conduct.  He found that after EVR became the owner of
    the retirement apartment residence “[t]he work continued as if nothing had
    changed”.  EVR had the same principal as the two corporate defendants who
    were parties to the Contract.  Seip signed cheques for EVR and was paid by
    EVR.  EVR got the benefit of Seip’s work.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge then considered the issue of damages.  While Seip argued that
    it alone had the power to terminate the Contract, the trial judge held otherwise.  He
    interpreted the Contract as also giving the owner the power to terminate
    the Contract at the end of a term.  Thus, he had to decide what the word “term”
    meant.  He noted that the commencement date of the initial term, as specified
    in the Contract, was January 1, 2002.  He held that a secondary term must
    be taken to have commenced when the first occupant moved into the retirement
    apartment residence, which was March 2003, because at that point Seip would
    have been providing management services, rather than consulting services.  He
    determined that each term, whether initial or secondary, was to be for five
    years.  Accordingly, he was of the view that the secondary term ran from
    March 2003 to March 2008.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
    on these conclusions, the trial judge held that Seip was entitled to damages
    for the amounts that it should have been paid from December 1, 2004 – the
    date on which the Contract was terminated – to March 31, 2008.  He assessed
    damages for breach of contract at $458,193.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Next,
    the trial judge considered whether to award punitive damages.  He rejected
    Hunking’s contention that termination of the Contract was not motivated by
    the prospect of a sale of the property to a third party.  He found that Hunking
    was an “unsatisfactory witness” and that there was no justification for firing
    Seip.  In the trial judge’s view, Hunking appreciated Robert Seip’s “bulldog
    determination”
    in seeing that the retirement apartment residence was constructed but did
    not view it as an asset when Seip was managing the residence.  </p>

    trial judge concluded that Hunking wanted to sell the property free of his
    obligations under the Contract and that was Hunking’s motivation for terminating
    the Contract.  He found that Seip’s reputation had suffered from the termination
    and the defendants’
    conduct thereafter.  However, the trial judge was not satisfied that the
    defendants had defamed the plaintiff, either intentionally or unintentionally.  In
    addition, while he thought the defendants’ conduct was “shabby”, he did not
    see it as sufficiently extreme as to warrant punishment.  Accordingly, the
    trial judge declined to award punitive damages.      </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defendants raise two issues on appeal.  Those issues are whether the trial

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>            (1)  holding
    that EVR was bound by the terms of the Contract; and </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>            (2)  his calculation

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    court called on Seip to respond only to the second issue.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>WAS EVR BOUND BY THE CONTRACT?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for the defendants argues that as EVR was not a party to the Contract, it
    cannot be held liable for damages for its breach.  He submits that by observing
    that Hunking was the principal of all three corporate defendants, the trial
    judge effectively pierced the corporate veil and ignored the separate legal
    identity of each defendant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    disagree.  While the trial judge noted that EVR had the same principal as
    the other two corporate defendants, it does not necessarily follow that the
    trial judge pierced the corporate veil.  In my view, the trial judge treated
    Hunking’s role in the three corporations as one piece of evidence on which
    to assess whether EVR had assumed the Contract through its conduct and, consequently,
    was bound by it.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    find it unnecessary to decide this issue based solely on an assessment of
    EVR’s conduct as, in my view, EVR accepted the Contract when it purchased
    the retirement apartment residence with full knowledge of the Contract, including
    article 11.2, and thereafter conducted itself as an owner in accordance with
    the terms of the Contract.  Unlike the trial judge, I do not read the stipulation
    in article 11.2 that the purchaser provide written acknowledgement as a condition
    of the sale or of the purchaser’s assumption of the Contract.  Rather, the
    stipulation appears to have been intended simply to provide Seip with evidence
    that the purchaser had assumed the role of an owner under the Contract.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the present case, while EVR did not give such a written acknowledgment, the
    role played by Hunking in the three corporate defendants, coupled with EVR’s
    conduct, was tantamount to such an acknowledgement and indicates that the
    parties had dispensed with the need for strict compliance with the stipulation
    in article 11.2.  Indeed, Hunking’s evidence was that the sale to EVR was “congruent” and “consistent”
    with article 11.2.         </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Hunking
    was the directing mind of all three corporate defendants.  At the time that
    EVR purchased the retirement apartment residence, Hunking was well aware
    of article 11.2 in the Contract, the clear intent of which was to bind EVR,
    as the purchaser, to the terms of the Contract.  EVR’s conduct, as found
    by the trial judge, shows that it accepted the Contract and, in addition
    to the other corporate defendants, accepted the role of owner under the Contract.  Recall
    the trial judge’s finding that after EVR purchased the retirement apartment
    residence and the land on which it stood, Seip’s work for the retirement
    apartment residence continued as if nothing had changed.  Seip operated EVR’s
    bank accounts.  EVR accepted Seip’s services, which were performed under
    the Contract.  EVR paid Seip for those services in accordance with the terms
    of the Contract.  The conduct of all parties demonstrated a common intention
    that the Contract continued with EVR as an owner, in conjunction with the
    other corporate defendants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,

    one takes issue with the trial judge’s determination that just as Seip had
    the right to terminate the Contract at the end of any given term, so too
    did the defendants.  Nor is there any quarrel with the trial judge’s finding
    that the defendants terminated the Contract on December 1, 2004, without
    cause.  Further, there is no disagreement that the defendants are liable
    for damages for breach of contract from December 1, 2004, to the end of the
    term of the Contract.  The only point that divides the parties is this: at
    what date did the term of the Contract end?  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defendants say that the trial judge erred in finding that the term ended
    on March 31, 2008.  They contend that the initial term of the Contract began
    on January 1, 2002, and ran for five years until December 31, 2006.  Thus,
    they argue, they should be liable only for damages from December 1, 2004,
    when the Contract was terminated, until December 31, 2006, when they say
    the term ended.  They maintain that if there is ambiguity in the Contract
    with respect to this matter, that ambiguity should be resolved against Seip
    because Seip drafted the Contract.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Seip
    says the trial judge correctly concluded that the term of the Contract was
    to have ended in March 2008.  It points out that the trial judge’s conclusion
    rests on his finding that the consulting term ended and a management term
    began in March 2003, when the first occupants moved into the retirement apartment
    residence.  While Seip admits that the definition of “term” of the Contract
    (<i>i.e. </i>the duration of each of the initial and secondary terms) could
    have been clearer, it contends that the trial judge’s finding is consistent
    with the parties’ intention that the initial term of the Contract was to
    run during the construction phase of the project, during which Seip would
    provide consulting services.  However, once construction was finished and
    residents had moved in, a secondary term of five years’ duration would begin,
    during which Seip would provide management services.    </p>

    Contract was drafted by a layperson, Robert Seip.  It is not a model of clarity.  In
    fact, it is very confusing.  Nonetheless, in my view, the trial judge’s interpretation
    cannot stand for two reasons.  First, the trial judge’s interpretation is
    based on a finding of fact which was not available.  Second, it offends basic
    principles of contractual interpretation.  I will deal with each reason in

    trial judge found that the parties intended the secondary term to begin when
    residents first moved into the retirement apartment residence and Seip began
    providing management services, rather than consulting services.  However,
    in light of article 6 of the Contract, it was a palpable and overriding error
    to so find.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Article
    6 deals with the fees that Seip was to be paid.  Article 6.1(a) provides
    that during the initial term of the Contract, Seip would be paid a monthly
    flat fee of $6,000.  In article 6, that fee is termed the
    “Consulting Fee”.  However, article 6.1(b) contains an example which explicitly
    shows that Seip would provide both consulting and management services during
    the initial term and that the initial term would run for five years.  Article
    6.1(b) reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In consideration of its services hereunder, in
    each Management Year the Owner shall pay to the Manager or at such address
    as the Manager may direct, a management fee (the “Management Fee”) equal

    fee shall be paid on account in monthly instalments on the first day of each
    month for the preceding month.  Adjustments with respect to any overpayment
    or underpayment of the Management Fee calculated as aforesaid for each Management
    Year shall be made on the basis of the annual financial statements as required
    by Article 4.1.1(b) hereof within thirty (30) days of the delivery thereof
    to the Owner unless within fifteen (15) days after receipt by the Owner of
    such statements the Owner requests in writing an independent review of such
    statement under Article 6.3 hereof in which case such adjustments shall be

    will be recalled that those parts of the Contract that differ from the Original
    Draft Agreement are in italicized type.  Thus, the example in article 6.1(b)
    must have been inserted after the Original Draft Agreement was prepared.  As
    is explicitly stated in article 6.1(b), the example was inserted to enable
    the parties to estimate the fees that would be paid in the initial five-year
    period.  Whatever ambiguity is engendered by virtue of other provisions in
    the Contract, the example in article 6.1(b) speaks directly to the matter
    in issue.  The fees in the example are expressly estimated on the basis that
    Seip would provide both consulting and management services during the “initial
    5-year period”.  In light of the specificity of the example in article 6.1(b),
    despite the difficulties created by the poorly drafted Contract, the parties’ intention
    is clear: Seip was to provide both consulting and management services during
    the initial five-year term.  Consequently, as I have said, it was not open
    to the trial judge to find that once Seip began providing management services,
    a secondary term began.   </p>

    any event, in my view, interpreting the Contract to provide that the initial
    term was to run for five years, followed by one or more secondary terms,
    each of a duration of five years, is consistent with basic principles of
    contractual interpretation.  Before considering the relevant provisions of
    the Contract, it is useful to recall certain of those well-established principles.  The “normal
    rules of construction lead a court to search for an interpretation which,
    from the whole of the contract, would appear to promote or advance the true
    intent of the parties at the time of entry into the contract”: see <i>Consolidated-Bathurst
    Export Ltd. v. Mutual Boiler &amp; Machinery Insurance</i>, [1980] 1 S.C.R.
    888, at p. 901.  To the extent possible, the contract should be construed
    as a whole and effect should be given to all of its provisions.  The provisions
    should be read, not standing alone, but in light of the agreement as a whole:
    see <i>Hillis Oil &amp; Sales Ltd. v. Wynn’s Canada Ltd.</i>, [1986] 1 S.C.R.

    1 of the Contract is entitled “Definitions and Schedules”.  The relevant
    parts of article 1 read as follows:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>WHEREAS The Owner as the registered owner of the
    Lands and Premises has agreed to employ Seip &amp; Associates Inc. as the

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.1  The terms defined in this Article 1 shall,

    unless the context otherwise requires:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>                                                …</p>

    definitions appear to specify the duration of the initial term in two different
    ways.  On the one hand, “Initial Term” is defined by duration (five years).  On
    the other hand, “Consulting Term” is defined to mean “Initial Term” and thus
    Initial Term could be defined by reference to the type of service that Seip
    was to provide.  In light of the obvious confusion caused by such definitions,
    the trial judge can hardly be faulted for interpreting the term of the Contract
    by reference to the type of service Seip provided.  However, when the definitions
    are read in conjunction with article 6, as discussed above, and article 5,
    it leads to the conclusion that the Contract was to run for an initial five-year
    term followed by secondary terms of five years, subject to earlier termination
    by any party.  Article 5 reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b><u>ARTICLE 5
    – TERMS</u></b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>5.1       The Consultant’s appointment hereunder
    shall be for the Initial Term subject to earlier termination as herein provided
    and any extensions thereto.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>5.2       The Manager’s appointment hereunder shall
    be for the Secondary Term subject to earlier termination as herein provided
    and any extension thereto.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>5.3       This Agreement shall be deemed to be
    automatically extended without any formal amendment for <i><u>5 years</u></i> from
    the present or any future expiration date unless the Manager gives written
    notice to the Owner not less than ninety (90) days prior to any such expiration
    date notifying the Owner that a renewal will not be exercised or granted.  It
    is understood that if the Manager gives such written notice or if this Agreement
    is terminated pursuant to any provision herein, there shall be no further
    renewal options.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    are two additional factors that support the interpretation that the Initial
    Term of the Contract was a period of five years, to be followed by one or
    more Secondary Terms of the same duration.  The first is that this interpretation
    gives
    “term” its normal meaning of duration.  The second is that, on this interpretation,
    the word “term” is given a consistent meaning throughout.  Whether an “Initial”
    or “Secondary” term, each term of the Contract would run for five years.  On
    the trial judge’s interpretation, however,
    “term” means two different things.  He first interpreted the “term” of the
    Contract to be the period during which Seip provided consulting services.   Thereafter,
    he interpreted “term” to mean the five-year duration of the Contract.  On
    basic principles of contractual interpretation, unless the context dictates
    otherwise, words in a single document should be presumed to bear the same
    meaning throughout.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    remains only to quantify the damages.  Based on the interpretation that the
    initial term of the Contract was a period of five years, the initial term
    ran from January 1, 2002, to December 31, 2006.  Relying on the uncontradicted
    calculations of Seip’s expert, Brad Lund, damages for the period December
    1, 2004, (when the Contract was terminated) to December 31, 2006, (when the
    initial term ended) are assessed at $278,741.00.</p>
