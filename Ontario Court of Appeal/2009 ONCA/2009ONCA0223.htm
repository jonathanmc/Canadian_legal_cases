    a period of some four months in 2003, the appellant engaged in a series of
    sexually explicit conversations over the Internet with a male undercover
    police officer. These conversations began in an Internet “chat room” called “#0!!!!!!!!!!younggirlsex.” The
    undercover officer used the name “mandy13”.  They continued communicating
    with each other through the chat room, by e-mail and by MSN exchange. </p>

    his extensive and sexually explicit conversations with mandy13, the appellant
    suggested she masturbate, offered her advice on how to masturbate and on
    other sexual matters, suggested that she might like to touch him sexually,
    and ultimately, after a telephone conversation with a female police officer
    posing as mandy13, he arranged to meet her for a planned sexual encounter.  The
    appellant was arrested on November 8, 2003 as he approached the female officer
    at the pre-arranged spot on a subway platform. </p>

    central issue at trial was whether the appellant believed that he was communicating
    with an adult rather than a child under the age of 14 and whether he had
    taken reasonable steps to ascertain the age of the person.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant testified that he believed from the start that mandy13 was likely
    an adult male and that he considered their conversations to be a role-playing
    game where the object was to keep the game going as long as possible.  The
    appellant denied having any sexual interest in men or in young girls.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    explained that he was familiar with sexually explicit chat rooms and role-playing
    games and that there were a number of features of his conversations with
    mandy13 that led him to believe that she was in fact an adult.  Among these
    were:</p>

    he first conversed with mandy13 he could see that she was simultaneously

    that she was likely an adult;</p>

style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mandy13

    appellant eventually arranged to meet mandy13 for a sexual encounter after
    he spoke by telephone to a female police officer posing as mandy13.  The
    appellant testified that the officer’s voice sounded abnormally high, like
    someone on helium, and that the voice was not believable as that of a 13
    year old.  The conversation led him to believe that he may have been dealing
    with an adult female or perhaps an adult couple. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    telephone conversation was taped by the police but the tape recording was
    lost and not available at trial.  The record of an earlier MSN conversation
    between the appellant and mandy13 was also lost.  The appellant alleged that
    the MSN conversation contained exculpatory material. </p>

lang=EN-US>TRIAL JUDGE’S REASONS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    a six day trial, the trial judge convicted the appellant.  The trial judge
    found that in the first conversation, the appellant had asked mandy13 when
    she would be 14 and then proceeded immediately to explicit sexual talk.  He
    concluded that on a “plain and literal reading of the first chat”, the appellant
    had suggested to a 13 year old girl that she masturbate and provided her
    with explicit instructions on how to do so.  The trial judge found that the
    appellant’s evidence that he believed he was dealing with an adult “defie[d]
    logic and common sense” and that he had not taken reasonable steps to ascertain
    the age of the person he was dealing with before he invited her to masturbate. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge concluded as follows with respect to this first exchange:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I believe the evidence supports the position argued
    by the Crown in that at the very least that the accused has committed the
    offence in question on the first communication with
    “Mandy”. The presumption in s. 172.1 (3) comes into play and as well the
    accused did not take reasonable steps to ascertain the age of the person.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Having so concluded, how does this conclusion impact
    upon the balance of the evidence and the continued communication between
    the accused and “Mandy”?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>The accused’s credibility must be assessed bearing
      in mind that his explanation comes long after disclosure was available
      to him and having regard to the totality of the evidence. In the accused
      case [sic] I am not convinced that his evidence has not been influenced
      by his desire to extricate himself his situation [sic]. While any witness
      is presumed to tell the truth such a presumption can be displaced by inconsistencies,
      contradictions and the evidence as a whole.</i> </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The accused as a witness appeared well educated
    and well spoken. He obviously does not lack intelligence. His testimony was
    in my opinion appeared [sic] glib and well rehearsed. It lacked internal
    and external common sense. He was at times self-contradicting and evasive
    in cross-examination.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Did there come a time when it can be said the nature
    of the conversation caused the accused to believe he was dealing with an
    adult? He of course claims that this was so from the beginning, a claim I
    find ludicrous in the circumstances. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge then considered the balance of the evidence regarding the subsequent
    internet conversations, the telephone call and the arranged meeting, and
    the significance of the lost evidence.  The trial judge concluded that the
    lost evidence of the MSN chat was not significant, but that the loss of the
    recording of the telephone conversation was problematic.  He concluded that
    by the time the appellant had this telephone conversation, “he may well have
    had reason to believe that the person he was dealing with was an adult.”  However,
    the trial judge also concluded that he did not otherwise believe the appellant’s
    evidence regarding his belief of mandy13’s age, nor did it give rise to a
    reasonable doubt in his mind.  He concluded that the Crown had proved the
    appellant’s guilt “up to and including” the time of the telephone conversation
    beyond a reasonable doubt, but that the Crown had not proven the appellant’s
    guilt for the time following the telephone conversation.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    central issue on this appeal is whether the trial judge erred in law in relation
    to his assessment of the appellant’s credibility.  In particular, the appellant
    submits that the trial judge erred by stating that the appellant’s explanation
    had to be assessed in light of the fact that it came long after the appellant
    had received disclosure. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    ease of reference, I repeat here the impugned passage from the trial judge’s
    reasons: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The accused’s credibility must be assessed bearing
    in mind that his explanation comes long after disclosure was available to
    him and having regard to the totality of the evidence.  In the accused case
    [sic] I am not convinced that his evidence has not been influenced by his
    desire to extricate himself the situation [sic].  While any witnesses is

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my respectful view, each of the three sentences in this passage contains
    a significant legal error. </p>
  <h3><i><span
style='font-weight:normal'>(1) Disclosure</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is wrong to state as a general proposition that the credibility of an accused
    must be assessed “bearing in mind that his explanation comes long after disclosure
    was available to him”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    were not referred to, nor am I aware of, any case dealing with a trial judge’s
    comment on the accused’s review or use of disclosure when assessing the accused’s
    credibility.  The authorities on the relationship between disclosure and
    credibility deal with jury trials where in cross-examination or closing argument
    Crown counsel suggests that an accused has tailored or fabricated his or
    her evidence in light of disclosure of the Crown’s case.  In my view, the
    principles that emerge from those authorities are instructive and applicable
    to this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R.
      v. Peavoy</i> (1997), 34 O.R. (3d) 620 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), the Crown had argued in closing argument before the jury that the accused
    had concocted his evidence after receiving disclosure.  The Crown had led
    no evidence to support this allegation and the accused had been given no
    opportunity to rebut it.  Weiler J.A. held, at p. 625, that the comments
    by the Crown were “improper”, “unfair” and prejudicial: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>In my view, Crown counsel’s submissions
      were improper and unfair in that the Crown’s concoction theory was raised
      for the first time in his closing address.  The appellant had no opportunity
      to respond to the Crown’s improper suggestion that he had tailored his
      evidence after receiving disclosure and the Crown’s editorial comments
      as to when the defence of self-defence was put forward.  Moreover, the
      comments made a trap of the appellant’s constitutional right to disclosure
      and suggested that his evidence was inherently suspect because the defence
      was disclosed only in the course of the appellant’s testimony.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R.
      v. White</i> (1999), 42 O.R. (3d) 760 (C.A.), the Crown’s cross-examination
      was calculated to suggest to the jury that the appellant’s testimony was
      suspect because he had received disclosure, knew the Crown’s case and himself
      had not been asked to reveal his case until he testified at trial.  Doherty
      J.A. held that questions posed by Crown counsel were improper and potentially
      prejudicial and stated, at pp. 767-768:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>As a matter of common sense, there may be considerable
    force to the suggestion that a person who gets full advance notice of the
    other side’s evidence and testifies last is in a position to tailor his or
    her evidence to fit the disclosure.  That inference, no matter how logical,
    cannot be drawn without turning fundamental constitutional rights into a
    trap for accused persons. [Citation omitted.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the other hand, as <i>White</i> recognized at p. 768, while questions concerning
    disclosure are “always potentially dangerous”, they are not always improper.  Where,
    for example, the accused has suggested that records in the Crown disclosure
    confirm aspects of his testimony, it may be proper for the Crown to cross-examine
    on the fact that the accused received and reviewed the disclosure prior to
    trial so that his or her testimony can be viewed in that light: <i>White</i> at
    p. 768; see also <i>R. v. Cavan and Scott</i> (1999), 139 C.C.C. (3d) 449

    ); <i>R. v. Kokotailo</i>, (2008), 232 C.C.C. (3d) 279 (B.C.C.A.). Similarly,
    it has been held that the Crown may refer to the accused’s receipt of disclosure
    in order to undermine a defence of alibi – particularly an alibi with no
    particulars – to suggest that the accused has tailored his evidence to fit
    the disclosure: <i>R. v. Khan</i> (1998), 126 C.C.C. (3d) 523 (B.C.C.A.); <i>R.
    v. Marshall </i>(2005), 77 O.R. (3d) 81 (C.A.); <i>R. v. Simon</i> (2001),
    154 C.C.C. (3d) 562 (Que.

    ).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, in the circumstances here, the fact that the appellant received
    disclosure could not properly or fairly be said to bear upon the assessment
    of his credibility.  Moreover, at no point did the Crown suggest or put to
    the appellant that he had fabricated or concocted his evidence in the light
    of the Crown disclosure.  Indeed, Crown counsel expressly distanced himself
    from any suggestion that the appellant’s evidence was the product of recent
    fabrication.  When the appellant’s counsel attempted to lead a prior consistent
    statement in re-examination, Crown counsel objected and confirmed that he
    was not alleging recent fabrication. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his own evidence, the appellant referred to the disclosure, but only in the
    sense that he recognized that disclosure reflected the case the Crown would
    lead at trial.  Much of this evidence contained technical and jargon-laden
    language that had to be explained to the trial judge.  The appellant indicated
    at a few points that he had reviewed the disclosure prior to testifying when
    offering his explanation of what the computer logs and transcripts meant.  As
    I read his evidence, however, he did not attempt to bolster or support his
    version by reference to the disclosure in a manner that would open him to
    cross-examination by the Crown that he had done so. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the end, this was simply a case, like all others, where the Crown disclosed
    its case to the accused and where the accused knew, well before the trial,
    the nature of the evidence the Crown would rely on to prove its case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    suggestion that disclosure had a bearing on the appellant’s credibility did
    not surface until the trial judge delivered his reasons, long after the appellant
    could be confronted with the suggestion or be afforded an opportunity to
    refute it and long after the appellant’s counsel could be given the opportunity
    to address the point in argument.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the fact that the accused enjoyed his constitutional right to disclosure
    had no bearing on his credibility in this case and the trial judge erred
    in law by stating that it did.  Even if the disclosure might possibly have
    had a bearing on credibility, trial fairness demanded that the accused be
    confronted with the suggestion and afforded the opportunity to refute it
    or make submissions before being disbelieved on that account.</p>
  <h3><i><span style='font-weight:normal'>(2) Burden of proof</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    stating “I am not convinced that his evidence has not been influenced by
    his desire to extricate himself the situation”, the trial judge appears to
    me to have shifted the burden of proof from the Crown to the appellant.  The
    appellant was entitled to the presumption of innocence and to the benefit
    of reasonable doubt.  It was not for the appellant to
    “convince” the trial judge that his evidence was to be believed or that that
    he was not simply spinning a tale to extricate himself. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    are such well-established principles that one must assume they were known
    by the trial judge, yet we cannot ignore his use of explicit language indicating
    that he approached the case in a manner that flies in the face of those basic
    principles.</p>
  <h3><i><span style='font-weight:normal'>(3) Witnesses are not presumed to be
        truthful</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Witnesses
    are not “presumed to tell the truth”.  The evidence of each witness is to
    be assessed in the light of the totality of the evidence without any presumptions
    except the general and over-riding presumption of innocence.  Perhaps a generous
    reading of the final sentence in the impugned passage could be that, as it
    was applied to the evidence of the accused, it somehow resurrected the presumption
    of innocence apparently ignored in the preceding sentence.  However, as we
    are dealing here with basic and fundamental rights essential to a fair trial,
    I do not think it appropriate to salvage what appears to me to be a clear
    error with a strained and generous reading of this final sentence. </p>
  <h3><i><span style='font-weight:normal'>What is the effect of the errors?</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent submits that as the impugned passage is found at a point in the
    trial judge’s reasons where he has already concluded that the Crown had proved
    its case on the basis of the very words of appellant’s first conversation
    with “mandy13”, the passage does not infect that finding and applies only
    to what follows it.  The respondent also submits that, when read as a whole,
    the trial judge’s reasons provide ample explanation for his adverse credibility
    findings with respect to the first conversation and that those findings are
    sufficient to sustain the conviction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not agree that the appellant could be convicted in relation to the first
    conversation simply by looking at the words he exchanged with mandy13.  The
    appellant offered the explanation that he believed that he was engaged in
    a role-playing game with an adult right from the start, and he testified
    that this belief was fortified by six facts:</p>
  <p>1.    the chat-room was designated as adult-only;</p>
  <p>2.    his observation before saying anything to mandy13 that she was logged
    into a pornographic website unlikely to be frequented by a child;</p>
  <p>3.    when he asked her about her age, she stated that she was 13 but added “lol”,  slang
    for “laugh out loud”, suggesting a joke;</p>
  <p>4.    mandy13 used what he regarded as a joke e-mail address</p>
  <p>5.    mandy13 purported not to have a photo available;</p>
  <p>6.    mandy13 was familiar with a “blush” command, causing his screen to
    turn pink, despite claiming to be new to the chat room.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>The trial judge could not
    convict the appellant without rejecting his evidence and the explanation
    that he offered in relation to that first conversation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent’s argument places undue emphasis on the manner or order in which
    the trial judge constructed his reasons and I would not parse his reasons
    in the manner suggested by the respondent.  It would be unsafe to assume
    that the trial judge’s explanation of his approach to assessing the appellant’s
    evidence only applied to what followed it and dangerous to assume that his
    credibility findings can be neatly divided into discrete portions in order
    to immunize one portion from the errors contained in another.  I find it
    difficult to see how or why the trial judge would or could take one approach
    to the assessment of the appellant’s credibility in relation to what happened
    after the first incident but isolate the first incident and apply a different
    approach to it. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    was not, as the appellant’s counsel put it, “an all or nothing case” where
    the trial judge had to accept all or none of the appellant’s defence.  However,
    the appellant essentially told one consistent story, namely, that at all
    times, he believed “mandy13” to be an adult playing a role.  On their face,
    the trial judge’s reasons suggest that he disbelieved all or part  of the
    appellant’s explanation because of the fact that the appellant had obtained
    disclosure, or because the appellant had not “convinced” him that he was
    not attempting to extricate himself.  That negative assessment, based upon
    either or both errors of law, was bound to infect his assessment of the explanation
    that the appellant offered in relation to the first exchange as well. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    recognize that by virtue of 172.1(4), a belief that the person is 14 years
    or older must be supported by reasonable steps to ascertain the person’s
    age.  The trial judge made a finding that even if the appellant believed
    mandy13 to be 14 years or older, he had failed to take reasonable steps to
    ascertain her age on the first conversation.  I am not persuaded, however,
    that this finding can be isolated from the errors I have identified with
    respect to the assessment of the appellant’s credibility.  While no doubt
    s. 172.1(4) introduces an objective element, the reasonableness of the steps
    taken to ascertain the age of the person must be assessed in context – here
    the unusual context of internet chat-rooms.  The appellant pointed to six
    different facts which led him to believe that mandy13 was an adult which
    arose in relation to the first conversation.  He asserted that by ascertaining
    those facts, he did take reasonable steps.  These six reasons were peculiarly
    specific to the world of internet chat-rooms and could only be assessed in
    the light of the evidence as to how internet chat-rooms operate.  Much of
    that evidence came from the appellant and assessing the reasonableness of
    the steps necessarily involved the trial judge’s assessment of the appellant’s
    credibility.  Simply put, the trial judge’s negative credibility assessment,
    fuelled by his concern that the “explanation comes long after disclosure
    was available”<i> </i>to the appellant and that the appellant had not “convinced” him<i> </i>“that
    his evidence has not been influenced by his desire to extricate himself his
    situation” was bound to affect the trial judge’s assessment of the reasonableness
    of the steps the appellant claimed he took. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not agree with the respondent’s submission that this is a case for the
    application of the curative proviso, s. 686 (1)(b)(iii).
     The appellant was entitled to have his credibility fairly assessed without
    being trapped by the exercise of his constitutional rights and, in my respectful
    view, he was denied that right.  It is not certain that the trial judge would
    have still disbelieved the evidence of the appellant had he not committed
    the legal errors that he did in assessing the appellant’s credibility.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I would allow the appeal, set aside the conviction and order a new trial.  In
    view of this conclusion, it is unnecessary for me to deal with the sentence
    appeal. </p>
