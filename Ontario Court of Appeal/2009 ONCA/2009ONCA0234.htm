    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario.  He has been a tobacco farmer for his whole
    life.  The farm on which he lives has

    family since 1929.   Mr. Stetler has
    three daughters and a son, all of whom have played an active role in running
    the farm.  The production and sale of
    tobacco grown on the family farm is the only meaningful source of income for
    Mr. Stetler and his son, and has been a partial source of income for his other
    children and their families.  Mr. Stetler
    expected that after he retired, his son would run the farm and support him with
    proceeds from the farm, a common practice among farming families. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The farm is approximately 100 acres in size and
    previously provided jobs for many workers, including local people who counted
    on the farm for income.  On the farm
    there are two large barns that can store approximately 4,000 bales or 180,000
    pounds of tobacco.  </p>

    Ontario,
    to participate in the tobacco growing industry, a person must obtain a basic
    production quota from the Ontario Flue-Cured Tobacco Growers’ Marketing Board
    (the “Board”).  All tobacco must be sold
    through Board auction sales to buyers licensed by the Board.  Pursuant to the Board Regulations, recipients
    of a basic production quota are allotted a marketing quota, which is calculated
    as a percentage of the basic production quota and reflects the amount of
    tobacco a producer is entitled to sell at the Board auctions.  At the relevant time, Mr. Stetler and his
    corporate personality 934671 Ontario Limited<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a> together owned 232,604 pounds of basic production quota.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On March 12, 1999, Mr. Stetler was charged with
    unlawfully selling three shipments of tobacco outside of the quota system:
    September 13, 1998 – 70 bales; September 20, 1998 – 66 bales; and February 4,
    1999 – 90 bales. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On October 23, 2001, the Board found that Mr. Stetler
    had unlawfully sold tobacco on the three occasions in question, in breach of
    the <i>Farm Products Marketing Act, </i>R.S.O.
    1990, c. F.9.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Board cancelled Mr. Stetler’s entire basic
    production quota, although it allowed him to sell the tobacco he had already
    grown. The amount of tobacco that Mr. Stetler improperly sold represented a
    small fraction of his total basic production quota.  He had no criminal record and had never been
    charged with a regulatory offence.  In
    short, apart from these infractions, he had (and has) an unblemished record as
    a tobacco farmer and as a citizen of this country. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Stetler appealed to the Agriculture, Food and Rural
    Affairs Appeal Tribunal (the “Tribunal”).  The Tribunal found him guilty of two, rather than three, infractions.  He was found not guilty of the September 13,
    1998, sale of 70 bales of tobacco.  Thus,
    he had been found to have unlawfully sold 6040 pounds of tobacco or 2.6% of his
    total basic production quota.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite having found that Mr. Stetler had committed
    two, rather than three, unlawful acts, the Tribunal affirmed the penalty that
    the Board had imposed and cancelled Mr. Stetler’s basic production quota in
    full.  The Tribunal’s reasons for
    upholding the penalty are contained in a single paragraph.  It said that Mr. Stetler was an experienced
    grower in a highly regulated industry who knew his obligations and knew that
    the penalty for breaking the rules would be severe.       </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Stetler challenged the Tribunal’s decision by means
    of an application for judicial review.  The
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court
    quashed the Tribunal’s decision on the basis that liability had not been established
    to the requisite standard and because of a reasonable apprehension of bias.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As the Tribunal decision had been quashed, nothing
    prevented Mr. Stetler from growing tobacco so he planted and harvested an
    entire season of tobacco worth approximately $170,000.  The Board wrote to him to say that while his
    basic production quota had been reinstated, it was appealing the
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court
    order and Mr. Stetler would not be permitted to market the tobacco if the
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court
    decision was overturned. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On appeal, this court restored the Tribunal’s
    decision on liability but directed the Tribunal to reconsider the penalty and
    provide further reasons for whatever penalty was imposed: <i>Stetler v. Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs Appeal Tribunal </i>(2005),
    76 O.R. (3d) 321 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    )
    (“<i>Stetler No. 1</i>”).  Mr. Stetler’s application for leave to appeal
    to the Supreme Court of Canada was refused: <i>Stetler
    v. Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs Tribunal </i>(<span style='font-size:
12.0pt;font-family:Times;'>2006), 219 O.A.C. 400n.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the meantime, all Mr. Stetler’s attempts to purchase
    basic production quota had been rejected.  However, he had been allotted marketing quota for the 2005 growing
    season.  On October 5, 2005, following
    this court’s decision in <i>Stetler No. 1</i>,
    the Board rescinded Mr. Stetler’s tobacco marketing instructions, refused to
    provide its customary pre-payment and locked the tobacco in the barn.  The parties later agreed that the proceeds of
    sale of the 2005 crop would be held by the Board pending the outcome of the
    reconsideration hearing.  The Board
    continues to hold those funds, apart from a portion of the funds that has been
    paid to a sharegrower, Dennis Hare.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Tribunal conducted the reconsideration hearing in
    May and July 2006.  In a note to the Tribunal
    in which he explained that he was unable to attend the hearing due to ill
    health, Mr. Stetler stated that his health problems were attributable to these
    protracted legal proceedings.  There was
    no evidence to contradict that assertion or cast doubt on it.  A letter from Mr. Stetler’s treating
    physician confirmed that he has serious health problems including coronary
    artery disease, hypertension, anxiety and an abdominal aortic aneurysm.  The letter goes on to state that Mr. Stetler
    would require surgery in the near future and that for him to testify “would be
    a significant stress to him and would adversely affect his health.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the hearing, Mr. Stetler’s son gave evidence as to
    Mr. Stetler’s grim financial situation, his ill health and the financial
    consequences flowing from cancellation of his quota.  He has depleted his life savings, lost most
    if not all of his retirement funds, and now lives on a government old age
    pension.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Tribunal rendered its reconsideration
    decision on August 2, 2006 (the “reconsideration decision”).  It gave Mr. Stetler the same penalty as had
    been previously imposed – in other words, it cancelled 100% of his basic
    production quota.  In its reasons, the Tribunal
    repeatedly stated that in determining penalty, it could not consider matters
    arising after the first Tribunal’s decision in 2002.  It expressly declined to consider Mr.
    Stetler’s financial circumstances and health because its reconsideration of
    penalty was to be based solely on “actions of the appellant [Mr. Stetler] prior
    to the date of the decision of the first Tribunal”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In determining that a complete cancellation of Mr.
    Stetler’s basic production quota was the appropriate penalty, the Tribunal
    emphasized the need for general deterrence. It stated that the sale of tobacco
    outside the regulated system “is the worst offence that a tobacco grower... can
    undertake.” Such a “deliberate illegal act, by any grower, strikes at the heart
    of the whole regulated system.” The Tribunal stressed the importance of the
    Board retaining absolute control over production and marketing.  On a number of occasions in the reasons, the
    Tribunal reiterated that in determining penalty, it did not matter whether one
    bale or 100 bales of tobacco were unlawfully sold, nor did it matter on how
    many occasions the wrongful act took place because each such act is serious.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Tribunal also stated that it looked for
    mitigating factors in this case but “found none”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once again, Mr. Stetler returned to the
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court.  By judgment dated January 8, 2008 (the “Judgment”),
    a majority of the Divisional Court allowed his application for judicial review,
    set aside the reconsideration decision and ordered the Tribunal to reconsider
    penalty once again.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Board appeals.  It asks this court to set aside the Judgment and reinstate the reconsideration
    decision which cancels Mr. Stetler’s basic production quota in full.  Mr. Stetler asks that the appeal be dismissed
    and that this court vary the Judgment by substituting its own decision as to
    penalty, rather than remitting it to the Tribunal for a further reconsideration.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Shortly before the oral hearing of this appeal, Mr.
    Stetler moved to adduce fresh evidence relating to events in the tobacco
    industry that have recently taken place.  In summary, the fresh evidence is to this effect.  The tobacco quota system is being abolished
    and a new licensing system for tobacco growers introduced.  The federal government has created a buyout
    program for tobacco farmers who wish to sell their quota and exit the industry.  Details of the program were given at an
    information session on February 18, 2009.  The deadline for accepting the buyout is March 23, 2009.  Mr. Stetler is clear: he will sell his quota
    through the federal buy-out program, if he can, and use the proceeds for
    support in his retirement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Should the present appeal fail and, on further
    reconsideration, the Tribunal impose a penalty other than complete revocation, some
    of Mr. Stetler’s quota would be returned to him.  However, unless the quota is returned before
    March 23, 2009, Mr. Stetler will be unable to avail himself of the federal
    buyout.  It is obvious that
    reconsideration by the Tribunal cannot take place by March 23, 2009, as that is
    but a few days hence.  Thus, the fresh
    evidence makes the questions surrounding penalty of critical importance.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties agree that the

    erred in concluding that the reconsideration decision was unreasonable.  If not, the question of the appropriate

    this court decide the matter?   If the

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I will outline four specific errors in principle which
    cause the reconsideration decision to be unreasonable.  However, as those errors flow largely from
    the fact that the Tribunal fundamentally misconceived its role when engaged in
    a reconsideration of penalty, I begin with that.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From its reasons, it is apparent that the Tribunal understood
    that when reconsidering the penalty to be imposed, it was to stand in the shoes
    of the Tribunal in 2002 and review the record as it stood at that time – it was
    not to consider evidence of events that occurred following 2002.  In my view, in the circumstances of this
    case, that approach is unreasonable.      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is nothing in the governing legislation that
    speaks directly to the matter of reconsideration of penalty following a
    decision by the courts to quash the original penalty and remit it.  Thus, there were no legislative constraints preventing
    the Tribunal from considering evidence after 2002.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The word “reconsider” denotes a broader consideration
    than a mere review of the record as it stood when the penalty was initially
    imposed.  There are many cases in which courts
    or tribunals have interpreted a legislative provision allowing the tribunal to “reconsider”
    a decision as enabling it to re-evaluate the original decision in light of new
    evidence or facts: see, for example, <i>Re
    Commercial Union Assurance and Ontario Human Rights Commission </i>(1987), 59 O.R.
    (2d) 481 (Div. Ct), at p. 487, aff’d (1988), 63 O.R. (2d) 112 (C.A.); <i>Jamal v. Ontario Public Service Employees
    Union </i>(2005), 203 O.A.C. 119 (Div. Ct.), at para. 10; and <i>Minalu v. Sims</i>, [2006] O.J. No. 291
    (S.C.) (Q.L.), at para. 15.<i> </i> </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Further, the narrow
    approach taken by the Tribunal is not consistent with the order of this court in <i>Stetler No. 1</i>, which directed the
    Tribunal to undertake a full reconsideration of penalty.  Nor is it consistent with the reasons of the
    court in <i>Stetler No. 1</i>.  At para. 108 of those reasons, the court
    stated that where a person’s livelihood is at stake, the extremely serious consequences
    of the penalty require the Tribunal to properly consider all relevant factors
    when determining the appropriate penalty.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As a matter of logic and basic procedural fairness, it
    would seem that the circumstances of an offender are relevant until a penalty
    is confirmed and final.  Surely our
    system of justice, whether in the courts or before administrative tribunals, is
    not so rigid as to bar a consideration of the effects that the process has had
    on the offender.  I do not suggest that a
    tribunal is bound to give any particular weight to such evidence but, in the
    circumstances of this case, in my view the Tribunal was bound to receive the
    evidence and consider how it might impact on the appropriate penalty, if at all.  It is hard to conceive how information of the
    effects of the legal proceedings and decisions of the Board and Tribunal could
    not be relevant to the just and appropriate penalty at the time that sentence
    was being imposed.   It goes without
    saying that this approach to a reconsideration hearing allows for compassion in
    the sentencing process as it enables the decision-maker to take into
    consideration the personal circumstances of an offender after the initial
    penalty was imposed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for the Board suggests that a consideration of
    post-penalty circumstances will create a slippery slope in which parties will
    wait out the effects of a penalty in order to build support for an eventual
    claim for relief.  I do not accept this
    argument.  As this case makes abundantly
    clear, the legal process, whether judicial or quasi-judicial, is far from a “walk
    in the park”, especially where an individual’s livelihood is at stake.  It is unlikely that a person would choose to
    remain enmeshed in proceedings while enduring serious harm to their personal
    and professional lives for years on end, simply to
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    marshall a possible case for a reduced
    penalty.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is as a result of misconceiving its role that the
    Tribunal committed the first error in principle, namely, its refusal to
    consider evidence of matters occurring after 2002.  In so doing, the Tribunal failed to consider
    all relevant factors when determining penalty.  The significant adverse effects of these legal proceedings on Mr.
    Stetler’s health and financial affairs were relevant factors on reconsideration
    of penalty, as were the Board’s repeated refusals to permit him to buy fresh
    quota.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, it was unreasonable for the Tribunal to find that
    there were no mitigating factors in Mr. Stetler’s favour.  His age and health are mitigating factors.  So, too, is his unblemished record.  Apart from the incidents in question, he has
    never been charged with any regulatory or criminal offence.  For that matter, there is no evidence or
    suggestion that anyone in the Stetler family has ever been charged with any
    type of offence related to his farming business.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Stetler is 70 years old.  At the time of the reconsideration hearing,
    he was an elderly first-offender.  He had
    been a tobacco farmer for his entire life.  A total cancellation of his tobacco quota stripped Mr. Stetler of his
    vocation and his livelihood, and deprived him and his family of the way of life
    they have shared for the past 70 years.  While
    the prior Board and Tribunal decisions purported to permit Mr. Stetler to
    re-apply for new tobacco quota, each and every such application was denied.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, Mr. Stetler has complied with all regulatory and
    governmental dictates, before and after the incidents in question.  It cannot seriously be contended that, in
    light of his age, health and unblemished record, he was at any risk of
    re-offending if his quota, or some portion thereof, was returned to him.  Thus, specific deterrence was not an
    issue.  The mitigating factors speak also
    to the Tribunal’s concern for general deterrence, as I cannot imagine that the
    huge price Mr. Stetler has paid, both financially and in terms of his health,
    has gone unnoticed in the tobacco farming community.       </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, it was unreasonable for the Tribunal to give no consideration
    to the number of times in which a person has engaged in unlawful activity or to
    the quantities of tobacco which have been unlawfully sold.  There can be no quarrel with the Tribunal’s
    view that every unlawful sale of tobacco is serious.  However, just because each unlawful sale is
    serious, it does not mean that every such sale warrants the most serious of penalties,
    that is, cancellation of 100% of the tobacco grower’s basic production quota.  There must be some degree of proportionality
    between the wrongdoing and the penalty imposed.  The importance of proportionality is particularly significant where, as
    here, a person’s livelihood is at stake.  As the Divisional Court stated in <i>Carruthers
    v. College of Nurses of Ontario </i>(1996), 31 O.R. (3d) 377 at p. 404:a</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[N]ot every case is the worst case, nor every
    person adjudged guilty worthy of the most severe sanction.  There must be proportionality between the
    underlying findings and the penalty imposed.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>See
    also <i>Pavelic v. Royal College of Dental
    Surgeons of Ontario</i>, [1998] O.J. No. 2490 (
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Div. Ct.) (Q.L.), at paras. 5-6.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The penalty imposed in this case was for two
    infractions, occurring within a four-month period, following a farming career
    that spanned several decades without incident.  The amounts improperly sold amounted to approximately 2.6% of Mr.
    Stetler’s basic production quota.  The
    effect of total cancellation of Mr. Stetler’s basic production quota was
    crushing as, given his age and background, he had no real opportunity to
    rebuild his life in a different place and with a different vocation.  He was, in effect, given “capital punishment”
    for his transgressions. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This brings me to the fourth error in principle.  It does not appear that the Tribunal
    considered the full range of penalties available to it and then fashioned a
    remedy that appropriately reflected the seriousness of the offence and the
    situation of the offender.  In
    reconsidering the penalty, the Tribunal was exercising the powers of the
    Board.  The Board’s powers are contained
    in s. 21 of the Ontario Flue-Cured Tobacco Growers’ Marketing Board’s General
    Regulations, 2001-2002.  Section 21 reads
    as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The local <i>board
    may cancel or reduce or refuse to increase a basic production quota or a
    marketing quota</i> where the licensed producer to whom the said quota or
    quotas have been fixed and allotted has entered into a transaction or a series
    of transactions that has the effect of circumventing the provisions of these
    General Regulations or for any other reason that the local board deems proper.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It can be seen that the Tribunal had a large range of
    possible penalties at its disposal.  Again, in part because it appears that the Tribunal saw its role as
    reviewing the penalty previously imposed rather than reconsidering penalty
    afresh, the Tribunal meted out the most severe punishment available, without any
    apparent consideration of the range of possible penalties and whether something
    less than full cancellation of Mr. Stetler’s basic production quota could meet
    the appropriate sentencing objectives.     </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>WHAT RELIEF SHOULD BE IMPOSED? </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The parties agree that, pursuant to s. 134(1) of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.
    C.43, this court has the jurisdiction to impose the appropriate penalty in this
    matter.  In light of the history of this
    matter and the fresh evidence, I would exercise that power and impose the
    penalty, rather than remit it for a further reconsideration.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While “[a] court may not substitute its decision for
    that of an administrative decision-maker lightly or arbitrarily”, exceptional
    circumstances may warrant the court rendering a final decision on the merits.  Such circumstances include situations where
    remitting the case would be “pointless”, where the tribunal is no longer “fit
    to act”, and cases where, “in light of the circumstances and the evidence in the
    record, only one interpretation or solution is possible, that is, where any
    other interpretation or solution would be unreasonable”: <i>Giguère v. Chambre des notaires du Québec, </i>[2004] 1 S.C.R. 3, at
    para. 66.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Denby v.
    Agriculture, Food and Rural Affairs Appeal Tribunal </i>(2006), 216 O.A.C. 130,
    the Divisional Court varied the penalty imposed on a number of milk producers
    who had marketed milk outside the regulated quota system, contrary to the <i>Milk Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. M.12.  The Tribunal had reduced the producers’ milk
    quotas by a fraction of their total allotted quotas.  Further, it cancelled their production
    licences, thus terminating their participation in the industry.  While not interfering with the reduction in
    quota, the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court
    quashed that part of the order that cancelled the producers’ licences on the
    basis that cancellation was unjust, unnecessary and unreasonable:  <i>Denby </i>at
    para. 54.  It was disproportionate to the
    violations which, although serious, were brief in duration.  The producers had no previous records.  They had complied with the <i>Milk Act </i>and regulations during the time
    in which they had been permitted to keep their licences pending the application
    for judicial review.  The
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court
    noted that the significant financial penalties resulting from the loss of quota
    would serve as a sufficient deterrent to others in the industry. <i> </i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similar considerations exist in the present case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In determining the appropriate penalty, I will not repeat
    the sad history of these proceedings and the toll it has exacted on Mr. Stetler,
    which is set out above.  In my view, no
    matter what the appropriate penalty is, Mr. Stetler has more than served it.  Apart from some partial relief in 2005, Mr.
    Stetler has been deprived of his livelihood and way of life for the better part
    of a decade.  He has suffered enormously
    in these legal proceedings.  That
    suffering includes financial ruin, or something very close to it.  It extends to his health and the crushing
    impact on his family.  I agree with
    counsel for Mr. Stetler when he says that the process itself has been the
    punishment.  Mr. Stetler has suffered
    enough.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is a strong argument to be made that even absent
    the fresh evidence, this case cries out for the court to render a final
    decision on penalty, rather than remit it for yet a further
    reconsideration.  I am strongly attracted
    to that argument but decline to decide the matter solely on that basis for two
    reasons.  The first is simply that, in
    light of the fresh evidence, there is no need to do so.  The second is the importance of deference.  As this court so clearly stated in <i>Stetler No. 1</i>, the courts must respect
    the experience and expertise of regulatory bodies in fashioning appropriate
    penalties for infractions within a profession or industry.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, I end where I began.  In all but exceptional circumstances, if a
    regulatory body errs when imposing penalty, the matter should be remitted for
    reconsideration.  This is an exceptional
    case and the matter must end here.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>DISPOSITION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would grant the motion to admit fresh evidence.  In the circumstances of this case, the
    evidence sought to be admitted relating to the Tobacco Transition Program and
    deadlines for the program is necessary to deal fairly with the issues on appeal
    and declining to admit it could lead to a substantial injustice: see <i>Illidge (Trustee of) v.

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would dismiss the appeal and set aside para. 2 of the
    Judgment in which the matter of penalty is remitted to the Tribunal.  As a consequence of dismissing the appeal, the
    reconsideration decision cancelling Mr. Stetler’s basic production quota no
    longer exists and his basic production quota is reinstated.  For greater clarity, however, I would also declare
    that Mr. Stetler’s basic production quota is immediately reinstated and order
    the Board and Tribunal to forthwith take such steps as are necessary, if any,
    to achieve that reinstatement.  </p>
