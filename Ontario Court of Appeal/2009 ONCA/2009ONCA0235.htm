style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    case concerns the interpretation of a Separation Agreement, (the “Agreement”),
    signed by Albert DiDonato and his first wife, Dilia DiDonato, in 1995.  Under
    the Agreement, Mr. DiDonato was obligated to maintain a life insurance policy
    benefiting Ms. DiDonato in the amount of $100,000.00.  The question is whether
    this obligation was mere security for Mr. DiDonato’s companion obligation
    to pay spousal and child support, or whether it constituted an independent
    obligation.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Agreement specified that Mr. DiDonato was required to pay Ms. DiDonato spousal
    support until she reached 65 years of age.  The Agreement also required Mr.
    DiDonato to maintain a life insurance policy benefiting Ms. DiDonato in the
    amount of $100,000 until he was no longer obligated to contribute to her
    support.  When Mr. DiDonato died at the age of 58 in November 2004, he did
    have life insurance in place; however, the amount designated for Ms. DiDonato’s
    benefit was only $43,507.15.  As Ms. DiDonato was 56 years old at the time
    of Mr. DiDonato’s death, he was in breach of the terms of his insurance obligation
    under the Agreement.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms.
    DiDonato brought an application against Mr. DiDonato’s estate and against
    Mr. DiDonato’s second wife in her personal capacity, claiming entitlement
    to the shortfall in insurance proceeds.  Justice Sanderson held that under
    the Agreement, Ms. DiDonato was entitled to the full $100,000, and awarded
    the amount outstanding to be paid out of Mr. DiDonato’s estate.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    DiDonato’s second wife and trustee of his estate, Carol Turner, appeals.  She
    argues that the insurance policy was intended not as an independent benefit
    for Ms. DiDonato but as security for any outstanding support obligations
    at the time of Mr. DiDonato’s death.  Since it was agreed that the $43,507.15
    that Ms. DiDonato received under the policy was equal to or greater than
    the value of Mr. DiDonato’s outstanding obligation to pay spousal support
    at the date of his death, Ms. Turner contends that Ms. DiDonato should not
    be entitled to anything further from the estate.  Ms. Turner argues that
    the trial judge’s interpretation of the Agreement is incorrect and that Ms.
    DiDonato has consequently received a windfall beyond the bargain between
    the parties. </p>

    the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal.  In my view, the trial
    judge correctly interpreted the Agreement. </p>

    a 26-year marriage, the DiDonatos separated.  In July 1995, they signed the
    Agreement, which was expressly intended to constitute a full and final financial
    settlement.  Subsequently, they divorced and Mr. DiDonato married Ms. Turner.  He
    continued to maintain his contractual support obligations to Ms. DiDonato
    and to the children of the marriage.  However, he failed to maintain the

    a lump sum payment of $56,492.85, representing the difference between $100,000
    and the amount she received from the insurance company under the existing
    policy.
     She also sought an order for interim spousal support retroactive to December
    2004, pending resolution of this matter.  The interim support order was granted
    by Greer J. in October 2005 and specifically provided that the payments were

    a response to a request to admit, as to her understanding of the insurance
    obligation in the Agreement.  In her response, Ms. DiDonato had indicated
    that the contractual obligation in issue, under which Mr. DiDonato was required
    to maintain life insurance in her favour, was for the purpose of providing
    security for the spousal support payments due to her under the Agreement.  Further,
    Ms. DiDonato said that this understanding was based on information conveyed

    DiDonato also testified at trial as to her understanding of the reasoning
    behind Mr. DiDonato’s obligation to maintain the insurance policy and the
    circumstances in which she believed she would be entitled to the full $100,000.  She
    said that she had signed the Agreement based on her lawyer’s explanation
    that if her former husband died before she reached the age of 65, there would
    be $100,000 paid to her up front.  Ms. DiDonato added that she was advised
    that she would receive the $100,000 even if Mr. DiDonato died the day before
    she turned 65.  </p>

    to die before she reached 65, she understood that her spousal support payments
    would stop, and she would get the lump sum payment of $100,000.  When asked
    about her understanding of the meaning of paragraph 12(8), Ms. DiDonato said
    that if Mr. DiDonato died without the insurance in place as agreed, “the
    support for the wife and the children shall be the first that comes out of

    her reasons, the trial judge examined the provisions of paragraph 12 of the
    Agreement to determine whether Ms. DiDonato was entitled to judgment against
    Mr. DiDonato’s estate for his breach of paragraph 12(4). She started her
    analysis with the observation that by failing to maintain a life insurance
    policy designating Ms. DiDonato as the beneficiary of $100,000, Mr. DiDonato
    was in breach of the Agreement.  She went on to observe, at para. 15, that “[h]ad
    he done so, [Ms. DiDonato] would have received $100,000 of life insurance
    upon his death”.  Ms. Turner does not contest the accuracy of these statements.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge then identified the principle that where a contract has been
    breached, the aggrieved party is generally entitled to be put in the position
    in which he or she would have been had the contract been performed.  She
    further noted that an estate may be liable in damages for a deceased’s failure
    to maintain an insurance policy, citing <i>Adams (Next friend of) v.

    trial judge’s conclusion that Ms. DiDonato was entitled to judgment against
    the estate for the shortfall between what she received and the $100,000 Mr.
    DiDonato was obligated to maintain for her benefit, rested on her interpretation
    of paragraph 12(4).  However, since Ms. Turner relies heavily on the wording
    of paragraph 12(8) in support of her argument before this court, I will first
    discuss the trial judge’s reasoning in relation to that paragraph.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge interpreted paragraph 12(8) as providing Ms. DiDonato with security
    in the sense that any support obligations Mr. DiDonato had at the time of
    his death would constitute a first charge against the estate assets.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Significantly,
    the trial<span style='"Times New Roman";'> judge found that paragraph 12(8)
    did not derogate from Ms. DiDonato’s right to sue the estate for breach of
    contract based on her failure to receive $100,000 in life insurance. </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Pivotal
    to the trial judge’s conclusion that Ms. DiDonato was entitled to receive
    a total of $100,000 from the estate, was her interpretation of paragraph
    12(4) as a stand-alone provision whereby Mr. DiDonato agreed to maintain
    $100,000 of life insurance for the benefit of Ms. DiDonato until she turned
    65.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the basis of this reasoning, the trial judge awarded Ms. DiDonato $31,420.15:
    the difference between the $100,000 to which she was entitled under the Agreement
    and $43,507.15 that she had received from the insurance company, plus $25,071.91

    Turner argues that the trial judge erred in her interpretation of the Agreement
    by failing to consider the Agreement as a whole.  Specifically, it is alleged
    that she failed to interpret paragraph 12(4) in the light of paragraph 12(8).  Had
    the trial judge done so, she would have concluded that the “likely intention” of
    the DiDonatos when they entered into the Agreement was that the obligation
    to maintain a $100,000.00 life insurance benefit for Ms. DiDonato did not
    extend beyond the obligation to make support payments in the amounts specified
    under the Agreement.  In Ms. Turner’s submission, this intention is apparent
    in paragraph 12(8) of the Agreement, which sets out the remedy in the event
    that Mr. DiDonato died “without his insurance in effect contrary to the Agreement”.  This
    remedy is restricted to any claim for support being a first charge on the
    estate. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, paragraph 12(8) has little relevance to the central issue.   It
    is clear on its face that 12(8) is applicable only in the event that Mr.
    DiDonato did not maintain any insurance at all for Ms. DiDonato’s benefit.  This
    was not the case.  Mr. DiDonato did maintain insurance for the benefit of
    Ms. DiDonato; the insurance simply fell short of the agreed-upon amount.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, the wording of the Agreement does not support Ms. Turner’s position
    that paragraph 12(4) is linked to paragraph 12(8).  The fact that the commitment
    to maintain the insurance coverage came to an end at the same time as the
    support obligations, does not, in itself, connect that commitment to the
    support obligations in the manner Ms. Turner advances.  There is a conspicuous
    absence of express language to this effect.  Nowhere in paragraph 12 is it
    stated that the insurance was intended solely as security for outstanding
    support obligations should Mr. DiDonato die before Ms. DiDonato reached 65
    years of age.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms.
    Turner relies on the decision in <i>MacLean</i>, <i>supra</i>, for the proposition
    that where the obligation to maintain insurance is linked to the obligation
    to pay spousal or child support, damages are defined by the amount of support
    owing.  In my view <i>MacLean</i> does not assist Ms. Turner.   <i>MacLean</i> stands
    for the proposition that the failure of the deceased to maintain an insurance
    policy in breach of a domestic contract gives rise to a right of action against
    the estate “for an amount directly related to the loss resulting from the
    breach” (para. 27).  This is a proposition that supports Ms. DiDonato as
    opposed to Ms. Turner. That the remedy selected in <i><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New \(W1\)&quot;;
'>MacLean </span></i>was the payment of outstanding support, is not in itself
    sufficient to give rise to a principle of law; since no reasons for that
    aspect of the decision are provided, no principle is established.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover, <i>MacLean</i> is
    distinguishable on the facts. Unlike this case, the agreement in <i>MacLean</i> was
    expressly tethered to the obligation to maintain life insurance to the obligation
    to pay support. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    further note that the language of paragraph 12 is inconsistent with Ms. Turner’s
    contention that the life insurance policy was merely intended to be security
    for Mr. DiDonato’s diminishing spousal support obligations at the time of
    his death.  As is apparent from the various components of paragraph 12, the
    Agreement specifically precludes Mr. DiDonato from adjusting the amount of
    insurance designated in favour of Ms. DiDonato to account for diminishing
    future support obligations or for any other reason.  If the parties intended
    the insurance policy merely as security for the support payments, and nothing
    more, it would be unreasonable to preclude Mr. DiDonato from adjusting the
    face value of the policy as the total value of his outstanding support obligations
    declined.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    the interpretation advanced by Ms. Turner would lead to a result in conflict
    with the overall intention of the Agreement.  Before this court, counsel
    for Ms. Turner agreed that, had Mr. DiDonato been in compliance with his
    insurance obligation under the Agreement at the time of his death, Ms. DiDonato
    would have been entitled to receive the full $100,000 from the insurance
    company.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    significant concession undercuts Ms. Turner’s suggested interpretation of
    the Agreement.  I say this for two reasons.  First, it is counter-intuitive
    that the parties intended for Ms. DiDonato to receive less under the Agreement
    as a result of Mr. DiDonato’s breach than she would have received but for
    the breach.  Second, counsel for Ms. Turner suggested that, had Mr. DiDonato
    died in compliance with his insurance obligation, the estate may have considered
    an action against Ms. DiDonato claiming that she had been unjustly enriched
    by any life insurance proceeds advanced in excess of the outstanding spousal
    support obligations.  I cannot accept that the parties intended that litigation
    would be necessary in order to finally resolve their affairs if Mr. DiDonato
    happened to die at a time when he had maintained his insurance obligation
    in compliance with the Agreement and at a time when the value of the insurance
    proceeds designated for Ms. DiDonato’s benefit exceeded the amount of outstanding
    spousal support.  This result would be at odds with the parties’ express
    intention that the Agreement finally settle their respective rights and obligations.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is possible, indeed commonplace, for separation agreements to link the obligation
    to maintain life insurance to the obligation to pay support.  This Agreement
    did not do so.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    therefore agree with the trial judge’s conclusion that Ms. DiDonato was entitled
    to receive the full $100,000 if Mr. DiDonato died before she reached the
    age of 65 years, even if that amount exceeded the present value of the outstanding
    support obligations.    </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It

    Skrow conveyed the understanding to the First Wife that the portion of the
    Separation Agreement under which the Deceased was obliged to maintain life
    insurance in favour of the First Wife was for the purpose of providing security

    Agreement.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;'><span style='font-family:Symbol;

    all material times, the First Wife was of the understanding that the portion
    of the Separation Agreement under which the Deceased was obliged to maintain
    life insurance in favour of the First Wife was for the purpose of providing
    security to the First Wife for the spousal support payments due to her under
    the Separation Agreement. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms.
    Turner argues that a formal admission in civil proceedings is conclusive
    as to the matters admitted.  Ms. Turner contends that if the trial judge
    had considered Ms. DiDonato’s admissions, she would have concluded that the
    life insurance was nothing more than security for Ms. DiDonato’s support.  Upon
    payment of the debt for which the security was given, the security for the
    debt is discharged.  As Ms. DiDonato’s admissions were drafted by lawyers,
    the use of the word “security” should be interpreted in its technical legal
    sense. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    response, Ms. DiDonato argues that the trial judge did not err in failing
    to give effect to her admissions of understanding.  She submits that such
    extrinsic evidence is only admissible as an aid to contract interpretation
    where there is ambiguity in the written agreement at issue, such that it
    is not possible to determine the likely intention of the parties without

    such ambiguity in the provisions of paragraph 12.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, the trial judge did not err by failing to consider Ms. DiDonato’s
    admissions regarding her understanding of the insurance obligation in the
    Agreement.  In resolving disputes arising from the interpretation of contracts,
    the objective is to protect the reasonable expectations of the parties, as
    set out in the language of their agreement.  In the absence of ambiguity
    in the words of the contract, parole evidence of the subjective intention
    of the parties has no place in the interpretive exercise:  see <i>Eli Lilly &amp; Co.
    v. Novopharm Ltd.</i> [1998] 2 S.C.R. 129, at paras. 54-56. The trial judge
    found that the Agreement reflected the DiDonatos’ expectations in a clear
    and unambiguous manner – neither party has challenged that conclusion before
    this court.  On the contrary, in advancing her own interpretation of the
    Agreement, Ms. Turner maintains that it is not ambiguous.  She thereby implicitly
    acknowledges the irrelevance of extrinsic evidence in this case.  </p>

    paragraph 28 of the Agreement sets out what is commonly referred to as an “entire

    Turner submits that the trial judge erred in granting judgment to Ms. DiDonato
    on Ms. DiDonato’s own evidence regarding a matter occurring before the death
    of Mr. DiDonato in the absence of corroboration, contrary to s. 13 of the <i>Evidence
    Act</i>, which provides as follows:</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;page-break-after:avoid'><i><span
style='color:black;'>Actions by or against heirs, etc.</span></i></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify;'><span

      of the deceased person, unless such evidence is corroborated by some other

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view this section of the <i>Evidence Act</i> has no application.  The
    trial judge’s decision was based not on Ms. DiDonato’s evidence or admissions,
    but on the wording of the Agreement. </p>

    Turner also argues that the trial judge erred in deciding that Ms. DiDonato
    was entitled to a windfall extending beyond the bargain between the parties.  </p>

    disagree.  In my view, the trial judge’s decision did not result in a windfall
    benefit to Ms. DiDonato; the trial judge merely enforced the agreement into
    which Mr. and Ms. DiDonato had entered.</p>
