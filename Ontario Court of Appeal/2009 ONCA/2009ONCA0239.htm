line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent received a sentence of six months
    imprisonment plus probation for three years for failing to provide the
    necessaries of life. The Crown applies for leave to appeal and seeks to
    increase the sentence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This was a horrendous case of child neglect resulting
    in the tragic death of the respondent’s twenty-two month old son. At the time
    of the child’s death, he was badly injured and obviously in need of medical
    help. The post mortem examination revealed that the child had suffered multiple
    blunt force injuries to his head and neck resulting in internal injuries, as
    well as facial and neck contusions, facial abrasions and multiple scalp contusions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, the child suffered blunt force injuries to
    his extremities which resulted in three fractures, one to his left thighbone
    and two to his left forearm. The examination further disclosed lesions on the
    child’s body and physical ailments and abnormalities. While there was no proof that
    the respondent was responsible for inflicting any of the injuries to the child,
    many of the injuries were obvious and demanded immediate medical attention. And
    yet, for a period of ten or so days before the child’s death, when the child
    was apparently in pain and suffering from his injuries, the respondent did
    nothing. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the time of sentencing, although the respondent
    pleaded guilty and showed limited remorse, the trial judge expressed his
    concern on three occasions that she did not appreciate the seriousness of her
    failure to obtain medical assistance for her son. Her failure in this regard, as
    found by the trial judge, contributed to the child’s death. In the
    circumstances, taking into account that the respondent was essentially a first
    offender, the trial judge imposed a sentence of six months imprisonment to be
    followed by probation for three years.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, having regard to the enormity of the crime,
    which resulted in the death of an innocent child, the sentence imposed by the
    trial judge was manifestly unfit even accepting that the respondent was a first
    offender. A sentence of eighteen months imprisonment would have been fit under
    the old regime where the maximum penalty was two years. We make no comment on
    what the appropriate sentence would be under the present regime in which
    Parliament has seen fit to raise the maximum penalty to five years. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That said, the respondent has now served her sentence
    and is out of custody. Fresh evidence filed on her behalf answers to a
    considerable extent the trial judge’s concern about the respondent’s failure to
    appreciate the gravity and seriousness of her crime. The respondent has taken
    parenting and life skill courses while in custody and she has received
    counselling. She is required in accordance with the terms of her probation to
    participate in counselling as required by her probation officer. The probation
    order also contains terms that are designed to assist the respondent and ensure
    that she will never again engage in similar conduct. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In all of the circumstances, while we would grant leave
    to appeal, we would dismiss the appeal from sentence.</p>
