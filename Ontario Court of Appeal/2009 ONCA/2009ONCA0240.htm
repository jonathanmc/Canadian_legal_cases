    the objection of the other.  </p>

    appellant, Ms. Turcotte, and the respondent, Mr. Elliott, are the parents
    of two children: a son 9, and a daughter 7.   In 2003, after a 7-year marriage,
    the couple separated but continued to reside in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Peterborough where the family has always lived. Since separation, the children
    have resided in the former matrimonial home with their mother who works full
    time as a manager at the Peterborough Home Depot.  Mr. Elliott, a sergeant
    in the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Peterborough police force, lives close by with his new partner, Joanne Wilson.  </p>

    their primary home has been with their mother, the children spend a considerable
    amount of time with their father.  In addition to holiday access, every eight
    days the children are with Mr. Elliott and Ms. Wilson three full days and
    two nights.  Given Mr. Elliott’s work schedule, this access often falls during
    week days, allowing the children and their father to share the school day
    routine together.  Mr. Elliott also spends time, when he can, with the children
    at their various school functions and extracurricular activities.  </p>

    separation, Ms. Turcotte has wanted to move to Cobden, a city slightly north
    of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Ottawa, some 250 kms from
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Peterborough.  This is where Ms. Turcotte was born and raised and where a
    number of family members, including her parents, reside.  It is also a place
    where she has a job opportunity with Home Depot.  She very much wants to
    move there with the children and live there with her new partner, Mark Moss.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Concerned
    about Ms. Turcotte’s increasingly pressing desire to move, on June 16, 2004,
    Mr. Elliott obtained a “without notice” order preventing Ms. Turcotte from
    moving the children out of the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Peterborough area.   The parties then participated in mediation, which resulted
    in their entering into a parenting agreement.  The terms of this agreement
    were incorporated into minutes of settlement, which settled all issues between
    them except for mobility.  They agreed to arbitrate mobility.  The arbitration
    gave rise to an order dated August 26, 2005 that the children would stay
    in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Peterborough.  One of its terms provided that the issue of mobility could
    not be revisited for a period of 18 months.  The arbitration order was eventually
    incorporated into the terms of a final order dated December 12, 2005.  </p>

    the expiry of the 18-month period, Ms. Turcotte brought this application
    to vary the final order to enable her to move to Cobden with her children.  She
    argued that there had been a material change in circumstances and that it
    was in the children’s best interests that they move there with her.  Mr.
    Elliott opposed the application, maintaining that the best interests of the
    children would be served by maintaining the status quo.   </p>

    Turcotte appeals.  She submits that the application judge erred both in his
    apprehension of the facts and in his application of the law to the facts.  Specifically,
    Ms. Turcotte argues that the application judge:</p>

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>failed

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Gordon
      v. Goertz,</i> the Supreme Court of Canada set out a two-stage test for
      any application to vary a custody order.  At the first stage, the parent
      applying to vary must demonstrate a material change in the circumstances
      affecting the child that was not foreseen or reasonably foreseeable at
      the time of the original order.  If this threshold requirement is met,
      the second stage of the inquiry deals with the best interests of the child.  The
      court must conduct a full inquiry into all of the benefits and detriments
      of the proposed variation and determine whether it would be in the child’s
      best interests.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms.
    Turcotte submits that since the arbitration agreement stipulates that mobility
    cannot be revisited for a minimum of 18 months from the date of the arbitrator’s
    decision, the parties specifically contemplated a review.  Accordingly, a
    material change in circumstances need not be established.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    disagree.  Neither the circumstances surrounding the issue of mobility nor
    the wording of the agreement lead to the conclusion that this is one of those
    limited circumstances where a review was contemplated by the parties. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    takes us to the application of the two-stage test in <i>Gordon v. Goertz</i>. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    application judge correctly began his analysis by asking whether the circumstances
    since the final order in December 2005 had changed in a manner that materially
    affected the children’s best interests and that could not have been foreseen.  The
    circumstance that Ms. Turcotte emphasized was that her relationship with
    Mr. Moss had progressed to the point where they were planning to marry.  Ms.
    Turcotte further relied on a new job opportunity with Home Depot in Cobden.  Ms.
    Turcotte also pointed to her proposed plan to transport the children between
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Peterborough and Cobden to facilitate their relationship with their father. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    application judge found that the proposed move was foreseeable, indeed even
    contemplated, at the time the final order was made.  Referring to Ms. Turcotte’s
    relationship with Mr. Moss, the application judge found that at that time
    of the order, the two were involved in a serious relationship and had formed
    an intention to reside together.  He further found that at the time in question,
    a transfer by Home Depot to a managerial position in the Cobden area was
    available to Ms. Turcotte.  Simply put, nothing had changed. Ms. Turcotte
    was therefore unable to establish that the threshold requirement of material
    change had been met.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    see no error in the application judge’s analysis or conclusion on the issue
    of material change.  Accordingly, on that basis alone, we would dismiss the
    appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    for the following reasons, we agree with the application judge’s conclusion
    that the move from
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Peterborough to Cobden would not be in children’s best interests.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    application judge found that the children are very attached to both parents.  As
    he put it, “their whole world is their mom and dad”.  The evidence disclosed
    that when their parents first separated, the children went through a difficult
    period.  Fortunately, they are now thriving.  The application judge was further
    satisfied that a move that takes the children away from the familiarity and
    security of their friends, neighbourhood, school and activities would be
    disruptive.  Added to this would be the adverse effects of a significant
    change not only in the amount of time the children spend with their father
    but also in the nature of that time.  As counsel for Mr. Elliott suggested
    in argument, one cannot replace time at soccer games, sharing the joy of
    a win, with time spent on the highway.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    application judge’s order is a discretionary one.  It is therefore entitled
    to considerable deference from this court.  The application judge, who had
    the benefit of seeing and hearing all of the witnesses, made a number of
    findings of fact that assisted him in determining the children’s best interests.  The
    findings of fact relevant to this conclusion are well-supported by the record
    and we see no reason to interfere with the conclusion he reached.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Concerning
    the adequacy of reasons, the application judge’s reasons are thorough and
    comprehensive.  Indeed we consider them to be exemplary. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><b>Conclusion</b></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    the application judge found, the fact that Ms. Turcotte honestly believes
    that she would be happier living in Cobden with Mr. Moss and her children
    and that the children would benefit from this positive step in her life does
    not mean that the move would be in their best interests.  This is particularly
    so when the move would deprive the children of the close contact they enjoy
    with their father and the stability that is clearly beneficial to them.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly,
    the appeal is dismissed.  Mr. Elliott is entitled to his costs fixed at the
    agreed-upon amount of $10,000.</p>
