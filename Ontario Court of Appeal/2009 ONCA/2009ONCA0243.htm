      November 10, 2002, Martin Opoka was shot twice and was seriously injured
      in the parking lot of a plaza in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Markham,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario. His evidence was that the appellant, with whom he had been friends
    for ten years, telephoned him to arrange to meet at the plaza. When Opoka
    arrived, the appellant got into his car, pointed a gun at him and said that
    he was going to kill him. As Opoka began to flee, he was shot in the back
    by the appellant. Two other men, both unknown to Opaka, tried to cut him
    off, but he escaped.</span></p>

      defence position was that the appellant and two other men had met in the
      plaza to consummate a drug deal and that one of the two purchasers, Eion
      Rush, was the actual shooter. By the time of the trial, Rush was deceased,
      having been murdered in February, 2004. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      defence brought an <i>O’Connor</i> application to obtain the Peel Regional
      Police files and the Toronto Police Service files relating to Rush, particularly
      the investigation of  his murder. These files did not concern the investigation
      of the charge against the appellant. Rather, the defence argued that Rush’s
      background, including any propensity for violence, was relevant and necessary
      to make full answer and defence.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      only affidavit in support of the application was based on information from
      defence counsel that counsel was in a position to call evidence that Rush
      was the shooter. In arguing the application, counsel made the same submission.
      He acknowledged that there was no affidavit evidence saying that Rush was
      the shooter, or even that he was at the plaza that night. However, he argued
      that his own submission that he was in a position to call evidence that
      Rush was the shooter was enough, although he was careful not to undertake
      to call that evidence. Counsel argued that his submission about the evidence
      he was able to call meant that any information in the files sought that
      shows Rush’s propensity for violence met the “likely relevant” threshold
      required in an <i>O’Connor</i> application. </span></p>

      trial judge dismissed the application. He found that no sufficient evidentiary
      basis had been established that there existed a nexus between Rush, the
      victim, and the commission of the offence. He held that the submission
      by defence counsel amounted to no more than a bald assertion and was insufficient
      to establish the evidentiary foundation necessary to meet the likely relevance
      threshold that must be established in an <i>O’Connor</i> application.</span></p>

      appellant properly proceeded with an <i>O’Connor</i> application as the
      way to seek production of the police files. These were not files relating
      to the appellant’s case, nor were they in the possession or control of
      the prosecuting Crown, and do not therefore fall to be dealt with pursuant
      to the principles set out in <i>R. v. Stinchcombe</i>, [1991] 3 S.C.R.
      326. See <i>R. v. McNeil </i> 2009 S.C.C. 3.</span></p>

      first stage in an <i>O’Connor</i> application requires the applicant to
      show that the records sought are likely to be relevant in his or her trial.
      The appellant forcefully reminded the court that the burden is not onerous,
      as the majority made clear in <i>R. v. O’Connor</i>, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 411.
      In that case, the majority said that although not onerous, the burden is
      nonetheless significant, “to prevent the defence from engaging in ‘speculative,
      fanciful disruptive, unmeritorious, obstructive and time-consuming’ requests
      for production” (<i>O’Connor</i> at para. 24 quoting from <i>R. v. Chaplin</i>,
      [1995] 1 S.C.R. 727 at para. 32).</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      real debate here is whether the oral submission of counsel is enough to
      demonstrate the likely relevance of the records sought.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant argues that the records, given their nature, likely show Rush’s
      propensity for violence, and when this is coupled with counsel’s submission
      that he is in a position to call evidence that Rush was the shooter and
      therefore at the scene, the files meet the likely relevance test. The appellant
      relies particularly on the following passage from <i>O’Connor</i> at para.
      19:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The onus we place on the accused
      should not be interpreted as an evidential burden requiring evidence and
      a <i>voir dire</i> in every case. It is simply an initial threshold to
      provide a basis for production which can be satisfied by oral submissions
      of counsel. It is important to recognize that the accused will be in a
      very poor position to call evidence given that he has never had access
      to the records. <i>Viva voce </i>evidence and a <i>voir dire</i> may, however,
      be required in situations in which the presiding judge cannot resolve the
      matter on the basis of the submissions of counsel.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This
      passage clearly cannot be taken to mean that the accused can always satisfy
      the likely relevance requirement by means of the oral submissions of counsel. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There
      may, however, be cases where that can happen. The majority’s emphasis in
      this passage on the very poor position an accused will be in to call evidence,
      never having seen the records, suggests one example: since the accused
      has never had access to the records, oral submissions about their likely
      contents may be enough in some circumstances to meet the <i>O’Connor </i>threshold. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      this case, counsel’s oral submissions are not about the likely contents
      of the record sought. Rather, they are put forward to provide the nexus
      between Rush and the commission of the offence that is necessary to make
      the records relevant to the appellant’s trial, assuming that those records
      will demonstrate Rush’s propensity for violence. The appellant’s ability
      to show this nexus is not adversely affected by having no access to the
      records sought, since the records do not relate to this offence.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There
      can be cases where the oral submissions of counsel alone will be enough
      to meet the likely relevance threshold, even if those submissions do not
      address the likely contents of the records sought. However, I agree with
      the trial judge that this case is not one of them.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Assuming
      that the records demonstrate Rush’s propensity for violence, they become
      relevant in the appellant’s trial only if there is a sufficient connection
      between Rush and the crime. See <i>R. v. Grandinetti</i>, [2005] 1 S.C.R.
      27 at para. 27.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

      there is no affidavit evidence offered to supply that connection. There
      is nothing other than counsel’s submission that he was in a position to
      call evidence that Rush was the shooter. The Crown was not content with
      this, but viewed the submission as simply a bald assertion amounting to
      nothing more than speculation. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      these circumstances, it would have been quite proper for the trial judge
      to require the accused to lay a better foundation demonstrating a sufficient
      connection between Rush and the crime before permitting him to put the
      records in evidence, even if he had possessed them and assuming they were
      otherwise admissible to prove propensity. In that sense, what faced the
      trial judge was really a trial management issue that he could quite properly
      resolve as he did. Viewed in the context of this <i>O’Connor</i> application,
      it was equally proper for him to find that the oral submissions of counsel
      were not enough to make the records likely relevant in the appellant’s
      trial. I agree with his conclusion. This ground of appeal fails.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE PRIOR CONSISTENT STATEMENT
      ISSUE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      evidence was that Opoka initially lied to police officers about who shot
      him. However, some 48 hours later, after speaking with his parents, Opoka
      identified the appellant to the police as the shooter and has consistently
      maintained that position since then. In argument, the Crown urged that
      Opoka ought to be believed in part, because he repeatedly identified the
      appellant as his assailant. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      his reasons for judgment the trial judge recited both this evidence and
      the Crown’s argument based on it. From this, the appellant argues that
      the trial judge erred in using Opoka’s prior consistent statements to corroborate
      his trial testimony.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
      do not agree. The trial judge recited the evidence only as part of the
      narrative and referred to the Crown’s argument only in describing the Crown’s
      position. When he came to assess Opoka’s credibility he did so very carefully.
      He gave himself a clear warning in accordance with <i>R. v. Vetrovec</i>,
      [1982] 1 S.C.R. 811 and treated Opoka as an unsavoury witness. He exercised
      great caution in adopting Opoka’s evidence without confirmatory evidence.
      He rejected various aspects of his evidence. However he accepted Opoka’s
      evidence identifying the appellant as the shooter and clearly set out his
      reasons for doing so. They made clear that the trial judge did not rely
      in any measure on Opoka’s prior consistent statements identifying the appellant
      as the shooter to bolster his evidence at trial to the same effect.</span></p>
