  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>By The Court:</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
    appellant appeals his conviction and sentence by Ferguson J. on one count
    of sexual assault and one count of sexual interference.  At the conclusion
    of argument, the court entered a conditional stay of the conviction for sexual
    assault, but otherwise dismissed the appeal from conviction and sentence.  We
    indicated that the court would provide reasons for this disposition.  These
    are those reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
    appellant submitted that, in his reasons, the trial judge placed an onus
    on the appellant to disprove the Crown’s case, placed undue emphasis on certain
    factors in assessing the credibility of the complainant and took into account
    irrelevant factors in assessing the credibility of the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
    trial judge’s reasons are not reasonably capable of bearing the interpretation
    that he placed any onus on the appellant to disprove the Crown’s case.  Merely
    listing a series of factors, such as that the complainant gave a coherent
    and consistent account and that there was no suggestion that the account
    had changed since the first disclosure, does not reverse the burden of proof.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Counsel
    for the appellant concedes that the trial judge could properly rely upon
    such factors as a demonstrated lack of motive to fabricate and an absence
    of hallmarks of unreliability in assessing the complainant’s credibility.  He
    submits, however, that the trial judge placed undue weight on some of these
    factors.  We see no basis for this submission.  The trial judge listed fourteen
    factors that, in his view, supported a finding in favour of the complainant’s
    credibility.  We see nothing to show that the trial judge placed unreasonable
    emphasis on any one of them.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
    appellant submits that the trial judge improperly took into account certain
    factors in finding against the appellant’s credibility.  Again the trial
    judge provided a lengthy list of reasons for rejecting the appellant’s testimony.  Several
    of those factors depended upon the trial judge’s advantage of having seen
    and heard the appellant testify.  We are not persuaded that the trial judge
    placed undue emphasis on those factors or on the appellant’s demeanour generally.  See <i>R.
    v. M. (R.E.)</i> (2008), 235 C.C.C. (3d) 290 (S.C.C.) at paras. 48-50.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Counsel
    for the appellant singled out one portion of the trial judge’s reasons as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If [the appellant] were innocent, it seems unlikely
    that when [he] learned that the family was literally splitting up over the
    allegations, he would not make any enquiry as to what was alleged against
    him so he could try to mend the families’ previously close relationship;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As
    this court said in <i>R. v. Stark</i> (2004), 27 C.R. (6th) 190 at para.
    16:  “The manner in which an innocent person should react to an allegedly
    false allegation is an uncertain basis for drawing an adverse inference against
    an accused.”  However, the court went on to point out that in some circumstances
    there may be an evidentiary basis for drawing an inference against an accused
    because of his response to an accusation.  It may be that this is one of
    those cases where there was an evidentiary foundation based on the circumstances
    existing in this particular family.  In any event, this was but one of many
    factors the trial judge gave for rejecting the appellant’s evidence and we
    are not satisfied that the trial judge gave this factor undue emphasis as
    compared to the more compelling factors such as the appellant’s version of
    the Good Friday incident, which was contradicted by other evidence that the
    trial judge accepted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
    appellant submits that the trial judge erred in entering convictions for
    sexual assault and sexual interference.  This issue was not raised before
    the trial judge. The facts underlying both convictions are the same.  Thus,
    the factual nexus is clearly made out.  We are also satisfied that there
    is a sufficient legal nexus.  The legal nexus is similar to the legal nexus
    that the court found to exist in <i>Kienapple v. The Queen</i>, [1975] 1
    S.C.R. 729 itself.  See <i>R. v. Prince</i>, [1986] 2 S.C.R. 480 at 497.  The
    elements of the sexual interference offence are substantially the same or
    alternative to the elements of sexual assault either on the basis that one
    element is “a particularization of another element” or “there being more
    than one method, embodied in more than one offence, to prove a single delict”: <i>R.
    v. Prince</i> at pp. 500-2. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
    court has previously held that in those circumstances one of the convictions
    should be stayed in accordance with the rule against multiple convictions:  <i>R.
    v. M.&nbsp;(M.M.)</i> (1998), 122 C.C.C. (3d) 563 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  We were informed by counsel that in <i>R. v. Wing</i>, 2008 ONCA 618
    a somewhat different argument may have been made, not directly addressing
    the application of <i>Kienapple</i> to the charges of sexual assault and
    sexual interference. Thus, this court’s very brief endorsement in <i>Wing</i> should
    not be read to be inconsistent with the well established jurisprudence in <i>Kienapple</i>, <i>Prince</i> and<i> M.&nbsp;(M.M.)</i>.  We
    also note that courts in other provinces have applied the <i>Kienapple</i> doctrine
    to charges of sexual interference and sexual assault:  <i>R. v. Alyea</i> (1997),
    100 B.C.A.C. 241, and <i> R. v. C.G.F.</i>, 2003 NSCA 136.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly,
    the appeal from conviction for sexual assault is allowed and a conditional
    stay is entered.  The appeal from conviction for sexual interference is dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
    trial judge imposed a sentence of seven months imprisonment concurrent on
    both charges.  He carefully considered the possibility of a conditional sentence
    but rejected it as being inconsistent with the objectives of denunciation
    and deterrence.  We did not understand counsel to suggest that the trial
    judge erred in principle or that the sentence was unfit.  Counsel’s principal
    submission before this court was that a conditional sentence should be imposed
    because of the health issues now faced by his spouse.  We have considered
    this material but, in our view, the fresh evidence does not make out a case
    for a conditional sentence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This
    was a very serious offence involving sexual abuse of a boy over an extended
    period of time by his uncle.  The appellant was in a position of trust, the
    complainant having been left in his care when the incidents occurred.  The
    appellant’s spouse’s medical issues do not represent such exceptional circumstances
    as to justify imposing a conditional sentence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Accordingly,
    while leave to appeal sentence is granted, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
