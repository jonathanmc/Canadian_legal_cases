    order dated April 24, 2007, Cohen J. (the
    “application judge”) of the Ontario Court of Justice varied the terms of
    a child support agreement (the “agreement”) pursuant to provisions of the <i>Family
    Law Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3 (the
    “
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <i>FLA</i>”).  She ordered the father to pay retroactive support as well
    as increased ongoing payments based upon the
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    Ontario <i>Child Support Guidelines</i>, O. Reg. 391/97 (the “Guidelines”).</p>

    J. of the Superior Court of Justice (the
    “appeal judge”) allowed the father’s appeal.  He held that the Ontario Court
    of Justice did not have jurisdiction under the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <i>FLA</i> to vary the agreement because the agreement was interjurisdictional
    in nature. The father lived in the
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>
    and the appeal judge found the agreement was a “
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">U.S.</st1:country-region>
    contract”.  In addition, the appeal judge concluded that the <i>Interjurisdictional
    Support Orders Act, 2002</i>, S.O. 2002, c. 13 (“<i>ISOA</i>”) provided a “complete
    code for interjurisdictional support proceedings”
    and as a result, the Ontario Court of Justice did not have jurisdiction under

    mother appeals to this court with leave.  I would allow the appeal.  In my
    view, the agreement is a “domestic contract” as defined in the

    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <i>FLA</i><i> </i>and as such, the Ontario Court of Justice had the power

    proceedings, the <i>ISOA</i> does not displace jurisdiction under the

    the title of the agreement indicates, it deals with custody, visitation and
    child support.  The agreement provides that support payments are to be paid
    in American dollars and indexed according to American cost of living calculations.  It
    also provides that the payments are not tax deductible to the father and
    are not to be included in the mother’s taxable income. This provision was
    contrary to the <i>Income Tax Act</i>, S.C. 1970, c. 63 as it stood at the
    time the agreement was entered into.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

    did not have jurisdiction to vary the agreement.  He found that even if the
    father’s participation in the proceeding below was sufficient to constitute
    attornment, it could not confer jurisdiction where none existed.  The appeal
    judge took the view that the mother should bring her application under the <i>ISOA</i>,
    which in his view provided a “complete code for interjurisdictional support
    proceedings”.  Given his conclusion as to jurisdiction, the appeal judge
    did not address the father’s other grounds of appeal.</p>

    of the <i>Muscutt </i>factors support the conclusion that there was a real
    and substantial connection in this case.  There was a strong connection between
    the forum and the subject matter of the claim, which was an application to
    vary support for a child who had lived in
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario with his mother since birth.  As discussed above, the father attorned
    and submitted personally to the jurisdiction of the court.  There was no
    apparent unfairness to him in the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario court assuming jurisdiction.  While the mother would not necessarily
    be forced to litigate in another jurisdiction if the

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario court declined jurisdiction, she would have been compelled to start
    another proceeding under the <i>ISOA</i>.  Further, had analogous proceedings
    been initiated in a foreign jurisdiction, I am satisfied that
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario courts would recognize and enforce an order rendered on the same
    basis as the application judge rendered her decision.  Finally, while the
    case involves a resident of
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    New York
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    State, the application for variation of support for a child who has lived
    in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario since birth can hardly be described as having significant “international” elements.  In

    explained in <i>Muscutt</i> at para. 42, even if there is a real and substantial
    connection among the subject matter, the parties and the forum, the court
    retains a discretion to decline jurisdiction on the basis that there is a
    more convenient forum for the action.  In this case, the father did not argue <i>forum

    judge could have considered many of the factors now relied upon by the father

    ”
    contract and therefore not a “domestic contract” within the meaning of the <i>FLA</i>.  I
    do not accept this argument.  In my view, the father’s submission misconstrues
    the meaning of the word
    “domestic” in the term “domestic contract”.  The definition of a “domestic
    contract”, as well as other provisions of the Act, indicate that “domestic” refers
    to the subject matter of the agreement rather than to territorial or jurisdictional

    contract” to file the contract with an
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario court.  Section 35(2) provides that when a contract is filed under
    subsection (1), a provision for support or maintenance in the contract may
    be enforced or varied under s. 37 of the <i>FLA</i> as if it were an order
    of the court where it is filed.  </p>

    making his argument that the agreement is not a “domestic contract”, the
    father relies on a number of factors.  He points out that he did not attorn
    to the jurisdiction of the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario court when the mother first applied for support in 1993.  That application
    was dismissed with prejudice.  Further, the agreement was prepared by the
    father’s American attorney and uses language typically used in American family
    law agreements.  The father, the payor, lives in the
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      United States</st1:country-region>
    and the payments are to be made in American dollars and indexed according
    to American indicators.  The tax consequences of the agreement were inconsistent
    with Canadian tax law at the time the parties entered into the agreement.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appeal judge referred to some of these factors and said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>The evidence
    is consistent with a finding that the child support contract was a
    <st1:place

    contract.</p>

    respect, I do not agree that any of the factors relied upon by the father
    lead to a conclusion that the agreement was not a “domestic contract” within
    the meaning of the <i>FLA</i>.  A contract is a
    “domestic contract” if the subject matter is domestic in nature in that it
    relates to a family law issue or subject.  </p>

    51 defines the five types of contracts that are included in the definition
    of a domestic contract.  A “domestic contract” means “a marriage contract,
    separation agreement, co-habitation agreement, paternity agreement or a family
    law arbitration agreement”.  All of these agreements relate to matters that
    are “domestic” in the sense that they are family law related.  None of the
    definitions contain territorial or jurisdictional limitations. </p>

    addition, s. 58 of the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State

    <i>FLA</i> is informative.  Section 58 is a choice of law provision and is
    entitled “Contracts made outside

    Ontario”.  It provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The manner and

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    choice of law rules in s. 58 support the conclusion that the word “domestic” in
    the term “domestic contract” refers to the subject matter of the contract
    being of a family law nature, rather than to territorial or jurisdictional
    factors.  If a domestic contract were meant to be distinguished from a “foreign” contract,
    then the choice of law rules would not refer to a contract governed by a
    foreign law as a “domestic contract”. </p>

    father argues, however, that if a foreign contract such as the agreement
    in this case were a “domestic contract” capable of being filed and enforced
    or varied pursuant to s. 35, then parties would be able to circumvent the
    requirement of s. 58(a).  In the father’s submission, s. 58(a) requires that
    in order to be valid and enforceable in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario, a domestic contract must have been entered into in accordance with
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario’s internal law.  The father submits that allowing a party to file
    and enforce or vary a contract governed by foreign law without demonstrating
    compliance with s. 58(a) would lead to an absurdity.  The result would be
    that any foreign agreement, no matter how egregious its provisions, would
    be automatically enforceable or capable of variation simply because it has
    been filed under s. 35(1).  I do not accept this argument.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When
    a contract is filed under s. 35(1), it is open to a party who wishes to challenge
    enforcement or an application to vary to raise issues relating to the validity
    or enforceability of the contract before the court.  Where choice of law
    issues are involved, the validity or enforceability of the contract will
    be determined according to the law mandated by the choice of law rules in
    s. 58.  Contrary to the father’s submission, s. 35(2) does not provide that
    a domestic contract containing a provision for support is automatically deemed
    to be a court order in all circumstances, regardless of its terms.  Section
    35 simply provides a summary procedure which enables a party to file a contract
    with the court and to seek enforcement or variation of a provision <i>as
    if </i>that provision were an order of the court.  This procedure allows
    parties to take advantage of a variety of statutory processes designed to
    facilitate recovery of support and maintenance payments.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    is nothing in s. 35 that prevents a party responding to enforcement or an
    application to vary from raising arguments with the court that the contract
    filed under s. 35(1) is not valid or enforceable.  Indeed, it would not make
    sense that the mere filing of a contract that is invalid or unenforceable
    would have such an effect. </p>

    second possible interpretation of the reference in s. 51 to s. 59 is that
    it includes only those agreements which have been subject to the court process
    set out in s. 59.  Even if one accepts that interpretation, I do not think
    that it makes a difference in this case.  </p>

    the application in this case was not framed under s. 59, in effect, it engaged
    the same process.  The mother filed the agreement under s. 35(1) and sought
    to vary it under s. 35(2).  Significantly, both the process under s. 35(2)
    and s. 59 provide that a contract is to be treated as if it were a court
    order.  Under both processes, the provisions relating to varying a contract
    under Part III of the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State

    <i>FLA</i> apply.  The substance of what occurred on the application in this
    case was the same as if an application had been made under s. 59.  Moreover,
    throughout the proceedings, the father did not object to the court’s power
    to vary the agreement on the basis that it is not a “paternity agreement” because
    the mother failed to follow the s. 59 process.  </p>

    father submits that when the agreement was entered into, it was contrary
    to the <i>Income Tax Act</i> which, at the time, provided that child support

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The manner and

    are two possible interpretations of this provision.  The first, which was
    assumed by all of the parties to this appeal, is that s. 58(a) is a mandatory
    requirement for the validity or enforceability of a domestic contract governed
    by foreign law.  That is, regardless of whether the agreement is valid and
    enforceable under the proper law, in order to be valid and enforceable in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario, the agreement must have been “entered into in accordance with
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario’s internal law”.  Some cases have assumed the correctness of this
    interpretation, largely without discussion: see <i>Jahangiri-Mavaneh v. Taheri-Zengekani</i> (2003),
    66 O.R. (3d) 272 (S.C.), at paras. 34-35, rev’d on other grounds (2005),

    second interpretation of s. 58(a), which is arguably more consistent with
    the language and purpose of s. 58, is that it provides an alternative ground
    for upholding a domestic contract that is governed by foreign law.  On this
    view, resort to s. 58(a) is only necessary if the contract is invalid or
    unenforceable under the foreign law.  In that situation, a domestic contract
    is nonetheless valid and enforceable in Ontario if it is entered into in
    accordance with Ontario’s internal law: see <i>Mittler v. Mittler</i> (1987),
    17 R.F.L. (3d) 113 (Ont. H.C.), at pp. 129-131; <i>Ghavamshirazi v. Amirsadeghi</i>,

    is not necessary in this case to decide which interpretation is correct.  For
    the reasons that follow, I am satisfied that the agreement was “entered into
    in accordance with
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario’s internal law”.  That conclusion provides a complete answer to the

    <st1:place

    Ontario’s internal law” in s. 58(a) may well include matters going to the
    essential validity of the contract, such as consent and capacity.  It may
    also be that it includes various provisions of the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State

    <i>FLA</i> governing the validity and enforceability of certain terms in

    whatever the scope of s. 58(a), I am satisfied that the phrase “entered into
    in accordance with Ontario’s internal law” does not extend to substantive
    provisions in a domestic contract such as those relating to deductibility
    and taxability of support payments under the <i>Income Tax Act</i>.  That
    phrase must be interpreted in the context of s. 58(a) as a whole.  Section
    58(a) refers to the requirements for <i>entering into</i> a valid and enforceable
    domestic contract in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario and includes the types of matters I have just mentioned.  Further,
    the general rule in s. 58 is that, subject to limited exceptions set out
    in ss. 58(a)-(c), the validity and effect of a domestic contract will be
    governed by the proper law of the contract.  If a domestic contract had to
    comply with the entire body of substantive law of

w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    and
    <st1:State w:st="on">

    from his argument regarding the <i>Income Tax Act</i>, the father does not
    argue, nor is there any evidence, that the agreement is otherwise invalid
    or unenforceable.  The agreement is in writing.  No one has suggested it
    was not signed by both parties or that it was not witnessed.  Notably, at
    the time the agreement was negotiated and executed, the mother was represented
    by an

    straightforward requirements for entering into a domestic contract.  Moreover,

    domestic contract governed by foreign law, there is no power to do so.  I
    do not agree.  That argument ignores the scheme of s. 58.  As an exception
    to the general rule in s. 58, s. 58(b) prevents parties to a domestic contract
    from excluding the court’s discretion to override or set aside the provisions
    in domestic contracts referred to in ss. 33(4) and 56, notwithstanding that
    those provisions may be permitted under the proper law.  The fact that s.

    that jurisdiction is displaced by the <i>ISOA</i> which provides a scheme
    for the variation of support agreements.  The father argues that the <i>ISOA</i> provides
    the only means by which an applicant can apply to vary an agreement when
    the payor resides out of
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    respect, I conclude that in accepting the father’s argument, the appeal judge
    erred.  In my view, a resident of
    <st1:State w:st="on">

    under either the
    <st1:place

    <i>FLA</i> against a non-resident father are required to effect service <i>ex

    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario has a real and substantial connection to the subject matter of the
    application.  If the applicant is successful, the regime provided in the <i>ISOA</i> may
    be available to the applicant to enforce the resulting order in a reciprocating

    are three reasons why I conclude that the <i>ISOA</i> does not constitute
    a “complete code”.  First, the issue of whether a particular statute provides
    a “complete code” for the resolution of particular claims is ultimately a
    question of legislative intent: <i>Regina Police Assn. Inc. v. Regina (City)
    Board of Police Commissioners</i>, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 360, at para. 31.  There
    is nothing in the <i>ISOA</i> to suggest that it was intended to remove the
    right of applicants to proceed under the
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <i>FLA</i> by effecting service <i>ex juris</i> and demonstrating that the
    <st1:State w:st="on">

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    the <i>ISOA</i> expressly preserves the continued availability of remedies
    under other legislation.  Section 51<i> </i>of the <i>ISOA </i>reads:<u></u></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'><i>This Act does

    the broader interjurisdictional support regime contemplates that applicants
    will not be precluded from seeking remedies in their own domestic courts.  The
    statutes in reciprocating jurisdictions have provisions similar to s. 51
    of the <i>ISOA</i>.  The American <i>Uniform Interstate Family Support Act</i>,
    which was drafted by the National Conference of Commissioners of Uniform
    State Laws and adopted in reciprocating
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">U.S.</st1:country-region>
    states, explicitly acknowledges the continuing availability of remedies under
    laws such as the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <i>FLA</i> in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    arguing that the <i>ISOA </i>is a “complete code” for obtaining, varying
    and enforcing support orders against non-resident payors, the father relies
    on the decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in <i>Virani v. Virani </i>(2006),
    264 D.L.R. (4th) 524 and the decision of the New Brunswick Court of Appeal
    in <i>Booker v. Leonard </i>(2007), 321 N.B.R. (2d) 340.  In my view, both
    decisions are distinguishable and neither stands for the proposition that
    the <i>ISOA</i> is a complete code for interjurisdictional support proceedings
    in all cases.  To the extent that they can be taken to stand for this proposition,
    I would decline to follow them for the reasons stated above.</p>

    Act</i>, S.C. 1985, c. 3 (2nd Supp.).  She ordered retroactive support and
    payments under the federal Child Support Guidelines.</p>

    the order was entered, the father argued that the Court had no jurisdiction
    to make the order as the parties had been divorced by a foreign court.  The
    mother then moved to amend her notice of motion to include a claim for support
    under the <i>Family Relations Act</i>, R.S.B.C. 1996, c. 128.  The motion
    judge dismissed the father’s motion and allowed the mother’s motion to amend
    her pleading.  She also held that she had jurisdiction to make the corollary
    relief requested by the mother under the <i>Divorce Act</i>.  </p>

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>by enacting the [<i>ISOA</i>],
    the Legislature intended to make a code and did so for a very good reason;

    made the following comments regarding the application of the <i>ISOA </i>at
    paras. 8-9:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The [<i>ISOA</i>]
    has a precise mechanism by which a person resident in this jurisdiction may
    obtain a support order against a person not resident in this jurisdiction.  The
    mechanism engages public officers in both jurisdictions.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>The courts of
    this Province should not entertain any proceedings which might fairly be
    said to be wiggling out of the requirements of the scheme, at least in those
    cases in which one of the parties is a foreigner whose only tie to Canada,
    the habitual residence of his child, was imposed upon him by his former wife,
    the custodial parent. </p>

    J.A.’s decisions were referred to by the New Brunswick Court of Appeal in <i>Booker</i> at
    para. 25 for the proposition that the “the notion of comity and the existence
    of recourse through a provincial statute that enables foreign orders to be
    registered… favour adhering to the interjurisdictional support orders scheme.”  Larlee
    J.A. held that the court had no power under the <i>Divorce Act </i>to vary
    a foreign divorce decree granted in Bermuda – a reciprocating jurisdiction
    under the New Brunswick <i>ISOA </i>– with respect to child support and custody.  At
    para. 33, she concluded that jurisdiction to vary a foreign support order
    could only be derived from provincial legislation and noted that the <i>ISOA </i>was
    provincial legislation “to that effect”.<i> </i>At para. 35, she stated that
    a “foreign support order must be registered under the [<i>ISOA</i>] before
    it can be varied.”</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Despite
    the language used in these cases, I do not take either of them to stand for
    the proposition that the <i>ISOA </i>provides a complete code that excludes
    resort to provincial legislation in all cases where the payor is seeking
    support from an out-of-province father who resides in a reciprocating jurisdiction.  <i>Virani</i> and <i>Booker</i> primarily
    dealt with the power of a provincial superior court to vary a support order
    made by a foreign court as a corollary to a foreign divorce.  Generally speaking,
    the law in
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    British Columbia and
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    New Brunswick is no different than the law of
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario in this regard: see <i>Rothgiesser v. Rothgiesser </i>(1999), 46
    O.R. (3d) 577 (

    it is true that in <i>Virani</i>,<i> </i>Southin J.A. held that the court
    lacked jurisdiction to make an original order for support under the domestic
    legislation against an out-of-province father, the real concern in that case
    was the lack of connection among the subject matter of the proceedings, the
    parties and the British Columbia court: see <i>Kendregan v. Kendregan</i>,
    2009 BCSC 23, at para. 42.  In the circumstances of that particular case,
    allowing the mother to serve the father with what was, in effect, a motion
    to vary a foreign support order under the guise of a fresh application for
    support under the domestic legislation would have been contrary to the interests
    of comity.  Thus, Southin J.A.
    “could not have had in mind a situation where there was a real and substantial
    connection between the province and a non-resident father, nor was that issue
    before the court”: <i>Kendregan</i> at para. 58.</p>

    is no reason why an applicant may not pursue an out-of-province father for
    support or for variation of a support provision in a domestic contract where
    service <i>ex juris</i> has been properly effected and the real and substantial
    connection test has been met.  The real and substantial connection test was
    developed with the interests of comity in mind.  In <i>Society of Composers,
    Authors and Music Publishers of

    J. relied on the following comments by La Forest J. in <i>Tolofson v. Jensen</i>,
    [1994] 3 S.C.R. 1022, at pp. 1047-49.  At para. 60, he stated:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>From the outset,
    the real and substantial connection test has been viewed as an appropriate
    way to “prevent overreaching ... and [to restrict] the exercise of jurisdiction
    over extraterritorial and transnational transactions”....&nbsp; The test
    reflects the underlying reality of “the territorial limits of law under the
    international legal order” and respect for the legitimate actions of other
    states inherent in the principle of international comity. [Citations omitted.]</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    as a practical matter, I note that if the father’s argument that the only
    means for obtaining an original support order or varying a support agreement
    is under the <i>ISOA</i>, then issues of child access and custody would in
    some cases have to be dealt with in a different proceeding than child support
    where there is a non-resident payor.  That would be an unfortunate result
    and one that would run contrary to the principle that a multiplicity of legal
    proceedings should be avoided: see <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990,
    c. C.43, s. 138. </p>
