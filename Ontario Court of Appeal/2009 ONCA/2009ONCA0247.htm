  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    appellant appeals from his committal for surrender to the
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      United States</st1:country-region>
    by Wein J. for the offence of conspiracy to traffic in cannabis (marijuana).  He
    also applies for judicial review of the decision of the Minister of Justice
    ordering his surrender on the extradition request.  At the conclusion of
    argument the court dismissed the appeal from committal and the application
    for judicial review.  These are our reasons for those decisions.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE
      APPEAL FROM COMMITTAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    only ground of appeal argued on the appeal from committal is based on the
    appellant’s application to admit fresh evidence.  After the appellant’s committal,
    he came into possession of records of two interviews with one of the prosecution’s
    main witnesses, Gerald McPherson.  These records were disclosed as a result
    of parallel proceedings brought by the Attorney General of Ontario under
    the <i>Civil Remedies Act</i>, 2001, S.O. 2001 c. 28. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    first interview, which appears to be no more than a proffer of evidence by
    McPherson, closely matches the testimony McPherson was expected to provide
    as set out in the Record of the Case.  The second interview, which is a transcript
    of a recorded interview with McPherson, contains some details that are inconsistent
    with the proffer and hence the Record of the Case.  However, the core of
    McPherson’s story remains the same.  He explains the appellant’s role in
    the conspiracy to export marijuana to the
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      United States</st1:country-region>
    including his involvement in the shipment of the drugs and the payments to
    McPherson for transporting the drugs.  The inconsistencies in the details
    between the two versions are not such as to doubt the availability of the
    evidence for trial: 
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on"><i>United States of America</i></st1:country-region>
    <i> v. Ferras</i>, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 77, at para. 58.  Nor could it be said
    that McPherson’s proposed evidence has been shown to be manifestly unreliable
    despite the gaps or inconsistencies in the story as it is revealed in the
    second interview, especially as to how many times McPherson met with the
    appellant.  Even in the second interview, McPherson provides evidence that
    cogently implicates the appellant in a conspiracy to export large quantities
    of marijuana into the
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      United States</st1:country-region>
    .</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      In
    our view, the proposed fresh evidence would not have affected the disposition
    by the committing judge.  Accordingly, we would not admit that evidence.  The
    appeal from committal is dismissed.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE
      JUDICIAL REVIEW</span></h4>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Article
      17 <i>bis</i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    applicant is not a citizen of
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    and accordingly has no constitutional right to remain in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    under s. 6 of the <i>Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</i>  He thus has no
    right to a review in accordance with the factors set out in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      <i>United States of America</i></st1:country-region>
    <i> v. Cotroni</i>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1469. The applicant submits, however,
    that Article 17 <i>bis</i> of the <i>Treaty of Extradition between Canada
    and the United States of America</i>, Can. T.S. 1991 No. 37,  gives him a
    comparable right to have the Minister of Justice conduct a review to determine
    whether he should be prosecuted in Canada rather than the United States.  The
    applicant submits that it is apparent that the Minister did not conduct such
    a review.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      We
    would not give effect to this submission.  We have serious doubts that Article
    17 <i>bis</i> confers any rights on the accused.  However, we need not decide
    that issue since the applicant has not demonstrated that the Minister did
    not conduct the review.  The fact that the Minister authorized that the extradition
    proceed, and as the Attorney General did not launch a domestic prosecution,
    is itself some indication that the decision was made not to submit the case
    to Canadian authorities for the purpose of prosecution.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      Further,
    in his Reasons for Surrender, the Minister, while denying that the Article
    17 <i>bis</i> confers any rights on the applicant, went on to explain why
    he had decided to order the applicant’s extradition.  He identified some
    of the very factors listed in Article 17 <i>bis</i> such as the respective
    interests of the Contracting Parties and the availability of the evidence.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Failure
      to seek assurances</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    applicant submits that the Minister erred in ordering the applicant’s surrender
    without seeking assurances from the
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>
    that upon completion of any criminal proceedings the applicant would be able
    to return to
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    , rather than being deported to
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      India</st1:country-region>
    .  The Minister stated that such assurances are not necessary to protect
    the applicant’s right to fundamental justice.  The Minister also considered
    that an attempt to obtain such assurances would constitute an improper interference
    with the sovereignty of the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">United States</st1:country-region>
    .  The applicant has not shown that this was an unreasonable exercise of
    the Minister’s discretion.  In that respect we note that the applicant was
    already under a deportation order in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    and that his claim for refugee status had been rejected.</p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Refusal
      to delay surrender</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    applicant sought delay of his surrender until the forfeiture proceedings
    launched by the Attorney General of Ontario under the <i>Civil Remedies Act</i>,
    2001 had been disposed of.  The applicant points out that he has continuously
    asked the Attorney General to expedite those proceedings.  He submits that
    if he is deported to the
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      United States</st1:country-region>
    he will be unable to adequately defend against proceedings.  It is indeed
    unfortunate that the Attorney General of Ontario having launched these proceedings
    has been unable to speedily prosecute them.  However, whether to delay extradition
    is a matter of discretion, and we have not been persuaded that the Minister
    did not exercise his discretion reasonably.  The applicant has not provided
    any evidence as to how his ability to adequately defend those proceedings
    would be compromised.  In our view, mere assertions that he would not be
    able to instruct counsel or present relevant evidence without any explanation
    as to what evidence would be unavailable cannot demonstrate that the Minister’s
    decision was unreasonable.  In the circumstances, the Minister was entitled
    to give preference to the interest in an expeditious extradition process.</p>

    request for reconsideration turns on the availability of the fresh evidence
    dealt with in the appeal.  In view of our conclusion concerning the cogency
