  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>I.          OVERVIEW</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant was convicted of first degree murder.  He raises three grounds
    of appeal:</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Did
    the trial judge err in excluding evidence relevant to the deceased’s propensity
    for violence and his habit of carrying a gun?</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Did
    the trial judge err in failing to instruct the jury on the defence of self-defence
    as defined in s. 34(2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>?</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Did
    the trial judge err in failing to instruct the jury on the defence of provocation?</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    would dismiss the appeal.  On the first ground, the jury heard a great deal
    of evidence about the deceased’s criminal lifestyle, his propensity for violence
    and the many threats he had made against the appellant.  The jury also heard
    evidence that the deceased loved guns, habitually carried guns and owned
    literally hundreds of guns.  I think it was open to the trial judge, in the
    context of this evidence and the positions taken by the parties, to conclude
    that the excluded evidence would not materially assist the jury in deciding
    whether the deceased was armed when shot by the appellant, and that it could
    prejudice the jury in its effort to arrive at a true verdict based exclusively
    on the evidence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>With
    respect to the second and third grounds of appeal, the trial judge applied
    the air of reality analysis in deciding that neither self-defence, as defined
    in s. 34(2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, nor provocation should be left with
    the jury.  In doing so, the trial judge identified the constituent elements
    of both defences, considered the totality of the evidence and gave that evidence
    the interpretation most favourable to the appellant that it could reasonably
    bear.  I agree with her conclusion that neither defence should go to the
    jury.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    grounds of appeal do not involve any disagreement as to the applicable legal
    principles.  The dispute arises out of the application of those settled legal
    principles to the combination of circumstances presented in this case.  Given
    the nature of the arguments advanced on appeal, I will refer to the evidence
    in some detail.  In doing so, I will not rehearse all of the variations and
    contradictions in the evidence, but will attempt to present a summary that
    permits a proper understanding of the issues raised on appeal and my analysis
    of those issues.</p>
  <h2>II.        FACTS</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant and the deceased, Marshall McKinnon, had been friends and business
    partners at one time.  Both were part of the biker gang criminal sub-culture
    in the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ottawa area.  Neither was a stranger to the criminal activities, threats
    and intimidation associated with that lifestyle.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    friendship between the appellant and McKinnon soured in the early 1990s.  The
    reasons do not matter.  Over the next ten to fifteen years, each confronted
    the other from time to time.  Threats and altercations were not uncommon.  There
    was evidence that McKinnon threatened the appellant with a gun on more than
    one occasion, and twice tried to hire someone to kill the appellant.  The
    appellant testified that in about 1999, he started carrying a loaded shotgun
    in his vehicle both because of McKinnon’s ongoing threats and an attempt
    on his life in 1999 that had nothing to do with McKinnon.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    relationship between the appellant and McKinnon became particularly acrimonious
    late in 2003.  The appellant believed that McKinnon was spreading a lie among
    their mutual associates that the appellant was a “rat”
    for the police.  This made the appellant angry and afraid.  In his world,
    gaining a reputation as a police informant could be fatal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    February 5, 2004, the day of the homicide, the appellant attended a wake
    at Cagney’s restaurant for a friend’s children who had died in a fire.  Cagney’s
    is located in a small strip mall at
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    2953 Carling Avenue in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ottawa.  Cagney’s occupies the most westerly part of the mall.  A
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Harvey’s restaurant occupies the easterly part of the mall.  There is a small
    store between Harvey’s and Cagney’s. 
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Scrivens Street runs north and south immediately to the west of the mall.  Carling
    Avenue runs east and west to the south of the mall.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>McKinnon
    arrived at the wake some time after the appellant.  Shortly after McKinnon’s
    arrival, the two men argued.  Each insulted the other, the appellant threw
    food at McKinnon and some pushing and shoving followed.  Roger Nairne, a
    friend of both the appellant and McKinnon, with some help from others, separated
    the two men.  McKinnon was ushered out of Cagney’s.  Both the appellant and
    McKinnon were angry after the altercation.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>McKinnon
    went to
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Harvey’s.  Over the next two hours, he sat and drank coffee.  Nairne visited
    McKinnon in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Harvey’s at least twice.  Nairne testified that McKinnon was armed with a
    handgun while sitting in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Harvey’s and seemed determined to gain revenge for the humiliation inflicted
    on him by the appellant in Cagney’s.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant remained in Cagney’s at the wake.  According to his testimony,
    he was not aware that McKinnon was sitting in the adjacent
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Harvey’s or that Nairne had visited McKinnon.  There was, however, evidence
    that Nairne spoke with the appellant at least three times while, to Nairne’s
    knowledge, McKinnon was sitting in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Harvey’s.  It was part of the Crown’s theory that Nairne was keeping the
    appellant advised of McKinnon’s whereabouts.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant left Cagney’s about two hours after his altercation with McKinnon.  He
    walked toward his truck parked in the lot behind
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Harvey’s.  The appellant kept a careful lookout as he was very concerned
    that McKinnon could be hiding somewhere nearby waiting to attack him.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant got into his truck.  He had a loaded shotgun under the front seat.  He
    testified that he could not exit the parking lot along the laneway because
    a large truck had blocked his path.  The appellant backed his truck up until
    it was beside the ramp walkway leading down to the parking area from
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Harvey’s.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant saw McKinnon coming down the ramp shouting that he wanted to talk
    to the appellant.  The appellant got out of his truck and then realized that
    McKinnon was brandishing a gun.  As McKinnon moved down the ramp toward the
    appellant, the appellant backed up, slipped and fell to the ground.  Despite
    losing his footing, the appellant was able to reach into his truck and pull
    out his loaded shotgun from underneath the front seat.  The appellant fired
    two blasts in the direction of McKinnon.  McKinnon was not hit.  The appellant
    testified that he intentionally fired over McKinnon’s head to frighten him.  Forensic
    evidence confirmed that at least one shot struck the building above McKinnon’s
    head.  McKinnon disappeared momentarily but then reappeared on the ramp.  The
    appellant fired a third shot again intending to warn McKinnon.  After the
    third shot, McKinnon moved back into
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Harvey’s.  If, as the appellant contended, McKinnon had a weapon, he did
    not fire it during this encounter.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    firing three shots and seeing McKinnon head back to
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Harvey’s, the appellant returned to his truck and drove westbound along the
    lane running behind the strip mall.  When the appellant reached
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Scrivens Street, he turned southbound and headed toward
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Carling Avenue.  This route took the appellant immediately west of the part
    of the strip mall where Cagney’s was located.  The appellant could have turned
    right on Scrivens and driven northbound away from the strip mall.  For some
    reason, he chose to drive back toward the building into which McKinnon had
    fled only seconds earlier.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant testified that he drove southbound on Scrivens a short distance
    toward
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Carling Avenue.  He was stopped at the red light on the corner of Scrivens
    and Carling waiting for that light to change when he saw McKinnon standing
    in front of the extreme west end of Cagney’s.  McKinnon was yelling toward
    the appellant and pointing a gun at him.  The appellant testified that he
    thought that McKinnon could be firing the weapon at him.  McKinnon was standing
    about 50 feet away from the appellant’s vehicle.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the appellant’s evidence, he chose to jump from his truck, leaving it idling
    on the street, and run toward McKinnon carrying his loaded shotgun.  McKinnon
    turned around and ran back into Cagney’s.  The appellant continued the chase
    still carrying his loaded shotgun.  As McKinnon ran into Cagney’s, he yelled, “Somebody’s
    gonna shoot me”.  The appellant, in very close pursuit, ran into Cagney’s
    and yelled for everyone to get down.  There was a spent shell in the chamber
    of the shotgun and it could not be fired until the appellant cleared the
    chamber.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant testified that as he chased McKinnon through Cagney’s, McKinnon
    grabbed a bystander and seemed to be using that person as a shield.  McKinnon
    appeared to be trying to aim his gun at the appellant while holding the bystander.  The
    appellant ejected the spent shell from the chamber of his shotgun.  The bystander
    dropped to the floor and the appellant opened fire on McKinnon.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant insisted that he was not trying to kill McKinnon but only wanted
    to disable him because he feared McKinnon would kill him.  The appellant
    shot McKinnon at least twice.  The post-mortem revealed a significant gunshot
    wound to McKinnon’s lower right back, six smaller gunshot wounds to the right
    side and back parts of McKinnon’s right leg, and a gunshot wound on the inside
    of the left leg closer to the front than the back of the leg.  </p>

    into the police the next day.  </p>

    Scotty Killeen.

    Karam, the third witness who testified she saw McKinnon with a gun after

    trial, the Crown argued that the ongoing animosity between the appellant
    and McKinnon, fuelled by the false rumours McKinnon spread in late 2003,
    finally boiled over after the initial confrontation in Cagney’s.  The Crown
    submitted that the appellant had decided to kill McKinnon before the appellant
    left Cagney’s.  In furtherance of that plan, he left Cagney’s and waited
    at the bottom of the exit from
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place

    Harvey’s in his vehicle.  When McKinnon came out of
    <st1:City w:st="on">

    appellant testified that he had acted in self-defence throughout.  Counsel
    for the appellant could not advance that position before the jury as the
    trial judge held there was no air of reality to the defence of self-defence.  Before
    the jury, counsel argued that the appellant did not intend to kill McKinnon,
    much less plan to kill him.  Counsel argued that the appellant had left the
    wake, intending to drive away, when he had a sudden unexpected encounter
    with McKinnon, who was armed.  As counsel put it:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>This was a classic
    case of things arising suddenly.  And just unfortunately getting way out

    respective positions of the parties at trial confirm that McKinnon’s possession
    of a gun during the confrontation was an important factual issue at trial.  If
    McKinnon was not armed outside of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Harvey’s or during the fatal encounter that ended in Cagney’s, the appellant’s
    conviction on a charge of at least second degree murder was almost inevitable.  I
    also agree with Ms. Henein’s contention that the Crown’s position that the
    murder was planned and deliberate was stronger if the jury were to find that
    McKinnon was not armed.  If he was not armed, the defence could not successfully
    argue that the appellant decided to kill McKinnon only after his unexpected
    encounter with the armed McKinnon either outside of

    <st1:place

    Harvey’s or the fatal confrontation moments later.  The Crown argued that
    McKinnon was no stranger to the use of weapons, and was known to be a violent
    person.  The Crown contended that McKinnon had every opportunity to use a
    gun against the appellant if he had one and that his failure to use a weapon
    demonstrated that he did not have a weapon.  Alternatively, the Crown argued
    that even if McKinnon had possession of a gun, there was no evidence, apart
    from the appellant’s incredible version of events, that McKinnon ever used
    the weapon or threatened the appellant with it.  </p>

    for the Crown did not suggest at trial or on appeal that the evidence of
    McKinnon’s violent disposition and his habit of carrying a gun was irrelevant
    to whether he was in possession of a gun at the relevant time.  Nor did the
    trial judge find that the evidence was irrelevant.  In fact, she admitted
    a considerable body of evidence going to the appellant’s violent disposition
    and his habit of carrying a gun.  She also told the jury that the evidence
    of disposition and habit was relevant to their determination of whether McKinnon
    had a gun during the confrontation.</p>

    trial judge did, however, exclude some of the evidence offered for the purpose
    of establishing McKinnon’s violent disposition and his habit of carrying

    argues that the excluded evidence, which came from three police officers,
    was potentially powerful evidence going both to McKinnon’s propensity for
    violence and his habit of carrying a gun.  Most significantly, counsel contends
    this evidence did not suffer from the significant credibility problems associated
    with the evidence of McKinnon’s propensity for violence and habit of carrying
    a gun that the trial judge did admit.  Counsel submits that the evidence
    of three reputable police officers was far more probative than the evidence

    trial judge considered the admissibility of evidence of McKinnon’s propensity
    for violence and his habit of carrying a gun on more than one occasion during
    the trial.  The first ruling occurred at the end of the Crown’s case after
    a <i>voir dire</i> in which counsel for the appellant had led evidence from
    three police officers as well as Nairne.  The three police officers had been
    involved in an undercover operation that targeted McKinnon, along with others,
    between 1994 and 1996.  They gave evidence about McKinnon’s violent disposition
    and habit of carrying a gun based on their involvement in that investigation.  Nairne’s
    evidence about McKinnon’s propensity and his habit of carrying a gun was
    based on his long-time criminal association with McKinnon.  </p>

    her initial ruling, the trial judge excluded all of the evidence.  While
    she accepted that evidence of McKinnon’s propensity for violence and habit
    of carrying a gun had some probative value on the question of whether the
    murder was planned and deliberate, the trial judge held that the prejudicial
    effect significantly outweighed that potential probative value.<a

    the initial ruling, the defence called evidence.  The appellant testified
    as did Nairne.  After hearing that evidence, the trial judge decided to allow
    Nairne to give evidence concerning McKinnon’s habit of carrying a gun.  Nairne
    was recalled and testified that he had known McKinnon for about ten years
    and had worked for him as a drug debt enforcer for six or seven years.  He
    was asked how often McKinnon carried a gun.  Nairne answered: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>Pretty well every
    day.  I would say every day.  The only time he didn’t carry one was if we
    couldn’t carry them because we’d just used them.</p>

    further testified that McKinnon would sometimes carry automatic weapons “depending
    on the situation” as well as handguns.  In cross-examination, Nairne agreed
    with the Crown’s suggestion that McKinnon “carried a firearm for every occasion”.  The
    Crown then asked: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>Q.        … [N]o
    matter what it is that you or he or together would be doing in a day, whether

    also agreed with the Crown that McKinnon loved guns, especially unusual or
    rare ones.  The Crown then suggested that McKinnon “wore a firearm the way
    some women wear jewellery”.  Nairne responded:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>I would say yes,
    he loved to carry things, whatever.  But he didn’t love it the way that was.  He
    carried them because he had to, because of his profession.</p>

    Killeen, who testified for the defence after Nairne, indicated that he had
    worked for many years as a drug debt collector for McKinnon.  He offered
    this insight into McKinnon’s interest in guns:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>Mr. McKinnon

    McKinnon in general terms.  He testified that he had worked for many years

    did not allow Nairne to refer to specific acts of violence perpetrated by
    him in the course of that business relationship.  </p>

    addition to the evidence about McKinnon’s violent lifestyle, his fascination
    with guns and his habit of carrying guns, the jury heard a great deal of
    evidence about the specific animosity between McKinnon and the appellant.
    The jury heard that McKinnon had threatened the appellant with guns, had
    attempted to have him killed, and was spreading false and dangerous rumours
    about the appellant. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

    summarized the evidence the jury heard, I turn to the evidence excluded by
    the trial judge.  The police engaged in an undercover operation between August
    1994 and March 1996, designed to infiltrate the drug distribution network
    operating in the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName

    Ottawa
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Valley.  The police considered McKinnon a primary target.  Inspector Sullivan,
    the officer in charge of the operation, testified that McKinnon was a known
    drug dealer who was regarded within that milieu as a violent person.  Sullivan
    was present when McKinnon was arrested.  One hundred and twenty-nine weapons
    were found in his possession, ranging from handguns to shotguns to sub-machine
    guns.  Some of the guns were loaded.  There were also other weapons found
    at the time of McKinnon’s arrest.  Sullivan believed that McKinnon was heavily
    involved in the buying and selling of firearms.  McKinnon eventually pled
    guilty to one count of possession of a prohibited weapon, one count of possession
    of an unregistered weapon and other non-weapon related charges.  </p>

    Mills worked as an undercover officer in the operation.  He befriended McKinnon
    and spent time with him.  Sergeant Mills testified that McKinnon often spoke
    of using violence to collect drug debts and bragged about his ability to
    have someone killed if he so wished.  Sergeant Mills testified that McKinnon
    was in possession of firearms on many occasions when they were together.  On
    the day McKinnon was arrested, Mills saw six shotguns sitting on a table
    in McKinnon’s residence.  </p>

    Tanguay was the third officer to testify on the <i>voir dire</i>.  He was
    involved in McKinnon’s arrest.  Tanguay testified that when McKinnon was

    trial judge gave detailed and careful reasons for excluding the evidence
    of the officers.  After determining that the evidence of McKinnon’s violent
    disposition and his habit of carrying guns was relevant to planning and deliberation,
    the trial judge identified the relevant exclusionary rule at para. 42 of
    her reasons:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>I must consider
    the probative value of the evidence when compared to its prejudicial effect
    and only rule the evidence inadmissible if the risks of prejudice substantially
    outweigh its probative value.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge first addressed the significance of evidence that McKinnon was
    armed during the confrontation to the issues of planning and deliberation.  Based
    on the evidence as it stood at the end of the Crown’s case, the trial judge
    concluded that evidence that McKinnon was armed was “of ambiguous probative
    value” (para. 45) on the question of planning and deliberation.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge next examined the probative value of the evidence given by the
    officers on the question of whether McKinnon had a gun during the encounter
    with the appellant that resulted in McKinnon’s death on February 5, 2004.  The
    trial judge found the evidence had limited probative value for four reasons.  First,
    the officers’ evidence referred to a timeframe that preceded the homicide
    by eight years.  Second, the officers’ evidence referred to McKinnon’s disposition
    and habit in the context of carrying out his drug distribution business.  There
    was no suggestion that the encounter between McKinnon and the appellant had
    anything to do with McKinnon’s drug dealing.  Third, the evidence of the
    officers relied to a significant extent on information provided to them from
    untested third parties.  Fourth, the officers’ evidence concerning McKinnon’s
    possession of a very large number of firearms at the time of his arrest was
    contradicted by the outcome of the criminal proceedings that flowed from
    that arrest.  In the trial judge’s view, the disconnect between the convictions
    actually entered and the evidence concerning the number of weapons possessed
    by McKinnon undermined the reliability of the evidence as an indicator of
    McKinnon’s disposition or habit.  </p>

    trial judge then turned to the prejudice side of the equation.  In her assessment,
    there was a real risk that the evidence would lead the jury to conclude “that
    the deceased got what he justly deserved” (para. 53).  The trial judge was
    also satisfied that permitting the evidence would introduce peripheral matters
    into the trial which could confuse the jury and prolong the trial.  For example,
    the trial judge noted that the proposed evidence could put in issue the details
    of the two-year undercover investigation conducted between 1994 and 1996.  The
    trial judge ultimately concluded that the potential prejudice flowing from
    the admission of the evidence significantly outweighed any probative value
    the evidence could have.  </p>

    applied the wrong legal test or materially misapprehended the evidence.  She
    contends that the trial judge erred in failing to appreciate that the evidence

    a weapon carried a much stronger probative force than did evidence directed

    be inappropriate to review the product of that exercise against any standard
    other than reasonableness.  Deference is due to the trial judge’s weighing

    trial judge made her decision to exclude the officers’ evidence at the end
    of the Crown’s case.  She declined, however, to change that decision when
    she did permit the defence to lead certain evidence of McKinnon’s habits
    from Nairne.  The trial judge’s decision to exclude the officers’ evidence
    is properly reviewed on appeal against the entirety of the evidentiary record
    at trial, including the defence evidence.  The core of her analysis remains
    unaffected by the defence evidence.  Her observations concerning the limited
    probative value of the officers’
    evidence on the issue of whether McKinnon had a gun at the time of the confrontation
    remain valid.  Similarly, her finding of the strong potential prejudice to
    the trial process should the jury hear the evidence of the officers is unaffected
    by the defence evidence.  </p>

    things did, however, change between the trial judge’s ruling and the end
    of the evidence.  First, assuming the trial judge was correct in describing
    evidence that McKinnon was armed as “of ambiguous probative value” on the
    issue of planning and deliberation, any ambiguity had disappeared by the
    end of the evidence.  A jury could well have convicted the appellant of first
    degree murder even if satisfied that McKinnon was armed.  However, if a jury
    found that McKinnon was not armed, I think that jury, even on the appellant’s
    description of the relevant events, would be hard pressed not to accept the
    Crown’s contention that the appellant had decided to kill McKinnon before
    he left the wake at Cagney’s.  That conclusion opened the door to findings
    of planning and deliberation.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>My
    conclusion that the trial judge’s characterization understated the potential
    significance of whether McKinnon was armed to the issues of planning and
    deliberation lends support to the appellant’s contention that the excluded
    evidence should have been admitted.  The second change in the circumstances
    between the trial judge’s ruling and the end of the evidence, however, points
    strongly toward exclusion of the evidence.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>By
    the time all of the evidence had been heard and counsel had made their closing
    arguments, it was crystal clear that both the Crown and the defence accepted
    that McKinnon had a violent disposition and that he habitually carried guns.  The
    extracts from the Crown’s cross-examination of Nairne referred to above (paras.
    41-43) demonstrate that the Crown accepted and indeed relied on the evidence
    of McKinnon’s disposition and habit.  </p>

    the Crown and defence agreed that McKinnon had a violent disposition and
    a habit of carrying a gun, they disagreed as to the inference that should
    be drawn from that evidence.  The defence contended that McKinnon’s propensity
    and habit supported the inference that, consistent with that propensity and
    habit, he was carrying a gun at the time of the confrontation with the appellant.  The
    Crown argued, given McKinnon’s violent disposition and habit of carrying
    a gun, that if he was, consistent with that habit, carrying a gun during
    the confrontation, he would have used it against the appellant.  Since he
    did not use his weapon, the Crown argued that it followed that he did not
    have a weapon.</p>

    summary, McKinnon’s disposition and his habit of carrying a gun, the factual
    issues to which the excluded evidence was directed, were no longer in dispute
    by the end of the evidence.  The dispute was over what to make of that evidence
    in the context of the events of February 5, 2004.  The evidence of the police
    officers would not have assisted the jury in determining what inference should
    be drawn.  The evidence was properly excluded.</p>

    on a murder case, has three elements.  First, the accused must have been
    subjected to an unlawful assault, or reasonably believed that he had been
    assaulted.  Second, the accused must, when he inflicts the fatal injury,
    be under a reasonable apprehension of the risk of death or grievous bodily
    harm.  Third, the accused, when he inflicts the fatal injury, must reasonably
    believe that he cannot otherwise preserve himself from death or grievous
    bodily harm:  <i>R. v. Pétel</i>, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 3, at p. 12; <i>R. v. LaKing</i> (2004),

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Each
    of the three elements of the defence has a subjective and objective component.  The
    trial judge found that there was no air of reality to the objective components
    of the second and third elements of the defence.  In her view, a reasonable
    jury could not be left with a reasonable doubt either as to the reasonableness
    of the appellant’s apprehension of risk of death or grievous bodily harm
    at the time he killed McKinnon, or the reasonableness of the appellant’s
    belief at the time he killed McKinnon that he could not otherwise preserve
    himself from death or grievous bodily harm.  For example, in concluding that
    there was no basis upon which the jury could have a doubt as to whether the
    appellant reasonably apprehended death or grievous bodily harm at the time
    of the shooting, the trial judge said, at para. 42:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>There was no
    direct evidence that, once Mr. Pilon grabbed his shotgun, got out of the
    truck and started to chase Mr. McKinnon, Mr. Pilon had an apprehension of
    death or grievous bodily harm.  <u>The circumstantial evidence does not reasonably
    support the inference that Mr. Pilon did have this fear.  It is unreasonable
    to infer that he would have gotten out of his truck, approached Mr. McKinnon,
    and then run after Mr. McKinnon with his gun not being ready to shoot, if
    he had an apprehension of death or grievous bodily harm by Mr. McKinnon.</u>  [Emphasis

    trial judge properly instructed herself that s. 34(2) could only be left
    with the jury if, on the totality of the evidence, there was an air of reality
    to that defence:  <i>R. v. Cinous</i>, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 3; <i>R. v. Fontaine</i>,
    [2004] 1 S.C.R. 702, at paras. 70-74.  She identified and applied the air
    of reality analysis (paras. 33-55) holding that the defence could go to the
    jury only if there was evidence upon which a properly instructed jury, acting
    reasonably, could have a reasonable doubt with respect to each of the constituent
    elements of s. 34(2).  The trial judge reminded herself that she was not
    to weigh the evidence in any ultimate sense, but to engage only in a limited
    weighing of the evidence to determine what inferences were reasonably available
    from the evidence, and whether any of those inferences could lead a properly
    instructed jury to acquit on the basis of self-defence as defined in s. 34(2).  This
    function excluded the drawing of inferences from primary facts or the assessing
    of credibility.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel’s
    first and primary argument is that the trial judge improperly dissected the
    ongoing confrontation between McKinnon and the appellant into segments and
    examined the fatal final confrontation in isolation from the earlier events
    and without regard to the history between the parties and McKinnon’s reputation
    for violence.  The trial judge was alive to all of the evidence.  She specifically
    referred to the evidence of McKinnon’s habit of carrying a gun, his animosity
    toward the appellant, and his anger following the confrontation at the wake
    (para. 55).  The trial judge also reviewed the history between the appellant
    and McKinnon from the appellant’s perspective (paras. 7-13), and carefully
    outlined the events beginning with the altercation at the wake and ending
    with the shooting (paras. 16-32).  The trial judge had a firm grasp of the
    evidentiary record.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    the trial judge properly considered the entirety of the record, she correctly
    focused on the evidence concerning the appellant’s state of mind when the
    fatal shots were fired.  The defence of self-defence is only available if
    on the evidence there is a basis to conclude (or at least have a reasonable
    doubt) that the appellant had the required reasonable apprehension and reasonable
    belief when he fired the fatal shots.  The events leading up to the shooting,
    the prior history between the parties, McKinnon’s habit of carrying a gun,
    and his violent disposition provide important context.  However, the justification
    for killing as defined in s. 34(2) must exist when the fatal shot is fired.  It
    is irrelevant to the availability of the defence that on the evidence the
    defence may have been available at some earlier point in the confrontation:  see <i>R.
    v. Lavallee</i>, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 852, at pp. 884, 889; <i>R. v. Pintar</i> (1996),

    second submission arises out of the trial judge’s description of the appellant
    as the “attacker” when he shot and killed McKinnon.  Counsel submits that
    the trial judge erred in law in holding that the appellant forfeited any
    claim to self-defence because he was the “attacker” when he fired the fatal
    shot.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    see no error in this part of the trial judge’s analysis.  Self-defence is
    a justification based on the necessity of self-preservation.  The rationale
    underlying that self-preservation is fundamentally at odds with the motivation
    of one who attacks and kills another.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    any event, the correctness of the trial judge’s analysis does not turn on
    her use of the word “attacker”.  A person may be an attacker in the sense
    that he or she was the initial aggressor in a confrontation that results
    in a homicide.  That person may still be able to claim self-defence under
    s. 34(2):  see <i>R. v. McIntosh</i>, [1995] 1 S.C.R. 686, at para. 30.  The
    trial judge’s reference to the appellant as the attacker was not a reference
    to which of the two individuals was the initial aggressor in the confrontation.  When
    the trial judge used the word “attacker”
    she was focusing on the evidence pertaining to the appellant’s state of mind
    when he leapt from the vehicle and ran toward Cagney’s in pursuit of McKinnon.  In
    describing the appellant as the “attacker” the trial judge was indicating
    that his conduct could not reasonably be seen as defensive in any sense of
    the word much less motivated by a reasonable apprehension of death or grievous
    bodily harm at the hands of McKinnon and a reasonable belief that he could
    not otherwise preserve himself from that fate except by killing McKinnon.  </p>

    next argues that the trial judge unfairly limited the subjective component
    of the s. 34(2) defence when, at para. 53, she declined to factor into her
    assessment the attitudes and beliefs of the criminal sub-culture in which
    the appellant lived.  The trial judge described the submission in this way
    at para. 53:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>[T]he proposition
    put forward by the Defence was that someone in Mr. Pilon’s shoes, namely
    someone with a criminal record and with friends and associates in the criminal
    subculture, should not be expected to call on the police for assistance if
    his life has been or is being threatened, or if he is assaulted.  The court
    is being asked to accept as being reasonable that such a person does whatever
    he considers appropriate – even if contrary to law – to protect himself and
    react to any such threats or assaults.  In this case, the proposition put
    forward by the Defence was that it was reasonable for Mr. Pilon to carry
    a loaded shotgun with him in his truck so that he would be ready to repel
    any attack by Marshall McKinnon or anyone hired as a hit-man by Marshall
    McKinnon, and it should be considered reasonable for him to use it to ensure
    his future safety.  The proposition was that, in the culture in which Mr.
    Pilon lived, this was an appropriate and reasonable response, and therefore
    this is the standard that the jury should apply.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    rejecting the submission, the trial judge echoed the words of Binnie J. in
    his concurring reasons in <i>Cinous</i> at para. 130 where in respect of
    a similar argument, he said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>[T]he only way
    the defence <i>could</i> succeed is if the jury climbed into the skin of
    the respondent and accepted as reasonable a sociopathic view of appropriate
    dispute resolution.  There is otherwise no air of reality, however broadly
    or narrowly defined, to the assertion [of self-defence].  [Emphasis in original.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    test for self-defence created by s. 34(2) is
    “simultaneously subjective and objective”:  <i>R. v. Charlebois</i>, [2000]
    2 S.C.R. 674, at para. 13.  The defence turns in part on the accused’s apprehension
    of death or grievous bodily harm and the accused’s belief that he cannot
    otherwise preserve himself.  Both elements of the defence look to the accused’s
    state of mind, a necessarily subjective inquiry.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section
    34(2) provides, however, that both the apprehension and belief must be reasonable.  Reasonableness
    connotes a community standard against which the actions of individuals within
    the community can be measured.  Self-defence justifies what would otherwise
    be murder.  By its very nature, the defence is a measure of last resort.  The
    reasonableness standard ensures that the self-defence justification will
    not extend to killings committed in circumstances that the community, as
    represented by the jury, regards as unreasonable and beyond the pale of any
    acceptable justification.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    reasonableness inquiry is not, however, purely objective.  In deciding whether
    an accused’s apprehension of death or grievous bodily harm was reasonable
    and whether his belief that he could not otherwise save himself was reasonable,
    the jury must consider the relevant circumstances as the accused perceived
    those circumstances.  The jury then tests that perception against the community
    standard of reasonableness:  <i>Reilly </i>at pp. 404-405; <i>Lavallee</i> at
    pp. 873-74.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='"Times New Roman"'>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    see a world of difference, however, between testing the reasonableness of
    an accused’s apprehension and belief in the circumstances as the accused
    perceived them and testing the reasonableness of that apprehension and belief
    in light of the appellant’s personal moral code or world view.  It may well
    be, given the criminal sub-culture in which the appellant operated, that
    he lived by the motto “kill now or be killed later”.  In assessing the reasonableness
    of the appellant’s conduct, however, the jury cannot accept that motto.  To
    do so would be to effectively eliminate the “reasonableness” requirement
    from the defence of self-defence.  Instead of reflecting community values
    and the community perception of when a killing is justified, the validity
    of the self-defence justification would lay entirely in the eye of the killer.  A
    law of self-defence that justified what would otherwise be murder entirely
    on the basis of the accused’s personal belief as to the need to kill to save
    himself would constitute a stunning devaluation of the rights to life and
    security of the person to which all members of the community are entitled.</p>

    the reasons set out above, I am satisfied that the trial judge correctly
    declined to leave s. 34(2) with the jury.  Even if the defence should have
    been left, however, I would apply the <i>curative proviso</i> and dismiss
    the appeal.  An appellate court, when considering the effect of a legal error,
    should consider any findings of fact clearly made by the jury as long as
    those findings are not tainted by legal error:  <i>R. v. Haughton</i>, [1994]

    Crown argued that the planning and deliberation occurred before the appellant
    left the wake at Cagney’s.  The trial judge left that position with the jury.  She
    also told the jury that it could find that the planning and deliberation
    occurred between the first encounter at the steps of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Harvey’s and the final fatal encounter in Cagney’s.  While this possibility
    was available on the evidence, I think the jury’s finding of planning and
    deliberation is much more likely an indication that the jury accepted the
    Crown’s position that the appellant had decided to kill McKinnon before he
    left the wake and went to his truck.  In any event, on either scenario, the
    jury was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant had planned
    and deliberated upon the murder of McKinnon before the appellant jumped out
    of his car on the street and chased McKinnon into Cagney’s.  </p>

    appellant’s self-defence claim rested on the assertion that he shot McKinnon
    in response to McKinnon pointing a gun at him while standing behind a bystander
    whom he was using as a shield.  Counsel put it this way in her factum:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>When McKinnon
    grabbed a human shield and turned towards the Appellant, reaching for his
    gun, it was available for the jury to draw the inference that the Appellant
    reasonably believed that he could not otherwise preserve himself and therefore
    fired his weapon in self-defence.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Even
    if this view of the evidence gave rise to a self-defence claim (and I agree
    with the trial judge that it did not), it must be considered in light of
    the jury’s findings of planning and deliberation.  On those findings, the
    appellant had planned and deliberated upon the murder by the time he left
    his vehicle in pursuit of McKinnon and well before, on the defence theory
    of self-defence, McKinnon reached for his gun and created the need for the
    appellant to defend himself.  The jury’s findings of planning and deliberation
    preclude the self-defence theory advanced on behalf of the appellant.  </p>

    trial judge correctly identified the elements of the defence of provocation
    and subjected each of those elements to the air of reality inquiry dictated
    by <i>Cinous</i> (paras. 56-70).  I agree with her analysis and do not propose
    to repeat it. </p>

    reaching her conclusion, the trial judge reviewed the evidence, including
    the appellant’s own evidence in which he testified that he fully expected
    an attack by McKinnon and never actually intended to kill McKinnon.  The
    air of reality inquiry does not require that an accused’s testimony support
    a particular defence.  There may be an evidentiary basis upon which to leave
    a defence with the jury even where an accused’s own testimony disavows that
    defence:  <i>R. v. Gill</i>, 2009 ONCA 124, at paras. 18-21.  That said,
    it cannot be denied that an accused’s own evidence is an important consideration
    in the air of reality inquiry.  The appellant’s evidence offered no support
    for a provocation defence.  Nor was there any other evidence that gave the
    defence an air of reality.  The trial judge properly refused to leave the
    defence with the jury.  </p>

    I concluded that the trial judge should have left provocation with the jury,
    I would apply the <i>curative proviso</i> to that non-direction for the same
    reasons outlined in respect of the self-defence claim.  The jury’s unimpeachable
    finding that the murder was planned and deliberate renders any possible provocation
    defence fanciful. </p>

    need consider the trial judge’s ruling only as it relates to the issue of
    planning and deliberation.  As the excluded evidence was offered to support
    the claim that McKinnon was armed during the confrontation with the appellant,
    the exclusion of that evidence could not affect the determination that there
    was no air of reality to the defences of self-defence and provocation.  I
    say that because the trial judge assumed, for the purpose of considering
    the availability of those defences, that McKinnon was in fact armed as claimed
    by the appellant.  She held, correctly in my view,  that even on that assumption,
    there was no air of reality to either defence.</p>

    her factum, counsel also referred to s. 37.  It does not appear that s. 37
    was relied on at trial and counsel did not contend in oral submissions in
    this court that s. 37 should have been left with the jury.  In my view, there
    is no need to consider s. 37.  If the appellant does not have a tenable self-defence
    claim under s. 34(2), he does not have one under s. 37 in the circumstances
    of this case.</p>
