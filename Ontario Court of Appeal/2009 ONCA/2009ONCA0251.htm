style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    application judge appreciated the principles controlling a motion to compel
    solicitors to pay costs personally under Rule 57.07.  He understood that
    such orders must be given with “extreme caution”.  The application judge
    made several findings of fact against the appellant.  He relied on these
    findings to justify the order he made under Rule 57.07 requiring the appellant’s
    solicitors to pay part of the costs incurred by the respondents in the proceeding.  The
    findings of fact made by the trial judge are summarized at para. 18 of his
    reasons and need not be repeated here.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    proceedings before the application judge went on for almost three years.  There
    were numerous attendances and numerous proceedings within the broader scope
    of the application.  The application judge who managed the proceedings was
    in a much better position than this court to make the necessary assessments
    underlying the findings of fact he eventually made.  Those findings are,
    by their nature, somewhat subjective and the cold paper record cannot, in
    our view, capture all of the considerations that would be relevant to those
    findings.  We defer to the trial judge’s findings unless they are clearly
    in error and clearly material to his ultimate determination.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for the appellant took aim at one of the findings of fact made by the application
    judge.  The application judge determined that the counter-application brought
    by the appellant was totally without merit and he inferred from that that
    it was part of a delaying strategy.  Counsel submitted to us that the two
    points advanced on the counter-application were arguable.  He has convinced
    us that the application judge’s evaluation of those arguments was unduly
    harsh.  The arguments were not specious.  The application judge’s characterization
    of the merits of the counter-application was, however, only one of several
    factors relied on by him.  Even if we accept that there was some possible
    merit to those arguments, we do not think that this small adjustment to the
    factual backdrop would or should change the result arrived at by the application
    judge.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Slaght also submits that while a trial judge may have jurisdiction under
    Rule 57.07 to go back after litigation is finished and revisit costs orders
    made against a party with a view to imposing additional costs obligation
    on solicitors personally, there is a real danger in taking that path.  He
    submits that trial judges who revisit costs orders run the risk of unfairly
    judging the conduct of the solicitors through the lens of hindsight.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    accept that hindsight has no place in the evaluation required by Rule 57.07.  We,
    however, distinguish hindsight from the process of examining the entire course
    of litigation that went on before the application judge so that the application
    judge can put in proper context the specific actions and conduct of counsel.  In
    our view, this holistic after-the-fact examination of the solicitors’ conduct
    can have advantages.  First, it is more likely to produce an accurate tempered
    assessment and, second, it could provide a less intimidating method of approaching
    this kind of problem.  In our view, it could be more intimidating if solicitors
    were met at each step in a piece of litigation with claims for costs and
    the kinds of assessments that those claims can necessitate.  The timing of
    the Rule 57.07 application will depend on the circumstances of the particular
    case.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    have reviewed the other findings of fact challenged in the appellant’s factum.  We
    would not interfere with those findings.  We think there was ample basis
    to find that the conduct of the solicitors caused inordinate and unnecessary
    delay in these proceedings, particularly in the painfully protracted enforcement
    stage.  We also think there was ample basis for a finding that the conduct
    of the solicitors resulted in wasting of court time.  That conduct as referred
    to by the application judge included non-appearance on more than one occasion,
    disregarding court orders and being unprepared for various motions.  We would
    not interfere with these findings and they justify the conclusion arrived
    at by the application judge. The appeal is dismissed.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    our view, an appropriate order for costs on a partial indemnity basis for
    the appeal and the leave to appeal is fixed at $10,000, inclusive of disbursements
    and GST.  In arriving at this amount, we have regard to the history of this
    matter as outlined to us by counsel.</p>
