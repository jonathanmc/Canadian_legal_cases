  <h2>The Conviction Appeal</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge approached this case on the basis that the appellant had acted
    alone.  On the evidence, the appellant was not at the gas station at the
    time some of the credit card information ultimately used in the frauds was
    misappropriated from the credit card holders.  The trial judge found that
    the appellant had misappropriated that information when he was not physically
    present at the gas station by using a pinhole camera to capture the “PIN” information
    from the customers and by a surreptitious modification of the point of sale
    equipment to capture the encrypted information on the credit cards.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is unclear from the trial judge’s reasons whether the trial judge appreciated
    that both a pinhole camera (or video recording device) and the modification
    of the point of sale equipment were necessary in order to capture the required
    information.  It is certainly arguable that he proceeded on the basis that
    the camera could capture all the needed information.  If he proceeded on
    that basis, he misapprehended a significant part of the evidence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    do not have to decide whether in fact the trial judge misapprehended the
    evidence.  We are satisfied that on this record it was unreasonable to conclude
    that any of the data was misappropriated by modifying the point of sale equipment.  In
    our view, that conclusion is speculation.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    rest of the trial judge’s analysis of the evidence is not open to successful
    challenge on appeal.  Our conclusion that one of his findings was unreasonable
    affects only the verdicts on the counts relating to the Royal Bank as the
    appellant was not present on the only day when the Royal Bank credit card
    was used at the gas station.  With respect to the frauds on the other financial
    institutions, our finding of unreasonableness would reduce the amount of
    those frauds on some counts but would not justify quashing the convictions.  Consequently,
    the conviction on count 5 and the related possession of credit card data
    conviction in count 10 must be quashed.  The remaining counts stand.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant also raises a legal argument in connection with his convictions
    on three of the counts (counts 14, 15 and 16).  These counts relate to the
    possession of credit card data at the time of his arrest.  Counsel submits
    that these convictions should be quashed because the evidence established
    that these cards had been “blocked” by the relevant financial institutions
    and, therefore, could not be used to successfully defraud those financial
    institutions.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section
    342(3) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> does not require that the Crown prove
    that the issuer of the credit card could be successfully defrauded by its
    use before the Crown can obtain a conviction under that section.  In our
    view, the question of whether the cards could be successfully used would
    be relevant to a charge of defrauding the financial institutions who issued
    the cards, but is not relevant to the offence created by s. 342(3).  Those
    convictions stand.</p>
  <h2>The Proposed Fresh Evidence</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant proffered “fresh” evidence on the conviction appeal.  The evidence
    related to an investigation in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Brampton,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario into charges involving a similar <i>modus operandi</i> to these charges.  The
    appellant was found in possession of credit card data from customers at a
    Brampton Shell station but was not the employee who obtained the data.  Those
    events were subsequent to the events giving rise to these charges.  The appellant
    submits that the police investigation of the subsequent charges lends credence
    to the claim advanced by the appellant at this trial that he was the victim
    of a mistaken identification.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    fresh evidence does not support that contention.  If anything, the police
    investigation of the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Brampton charges strongly connects the appellant to participation in very
    similar charges to those he faced in this case.  That connection would not
    be helpful to the appellant.  The fresh evidence could not reasonably have
    affected the result at trial and cannot be received.</p>
  <h2>The Sentence Appeal</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant also appeals sentence.  The trial judge imposed sentences totalling
    3½ years.  He also gave the appellant credit for 18 months pre-sentence incarceration
    using the accepted 2 for 1 multiplier.  The net effective sentence was 5
    years.  The Crown accepts, and we agree with this concession, that the sentence
    was excessive when imposed.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    determining the appropriate sentence, we must also take into account the
    convictions that have been quashed in this court and that the fraud as proved
    is for a somewhat smaller amount than found by the trial judge.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    is also some readjustment needed of the credit given for pre-trial incarceration.  The
    trial judge made a slight arithmetic error and gave the appellant a little
    more credit than he deserved.  In our view, the appellant spent 7 months
    in pre-trial incarceration and deserved a 14 month credit.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Having
    regard to the 14 month credit for pre-trial incarceration, the circumstances
    of the offences, the offender’s background and the modifications in the convictions
    that we have made, we think an appropriate sentence would be 2 years.  We
    would reduce the sentences of 3½ years imposed on several of the counts to
    2 years with all sentences to run concurrently.  In the result, the appellant
    has a total sentence of 2 years beginning on the day the sentence was imposed
    by the trial judge.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    conviction appeal is allowed with respect to counts 5 and 10, the convictions
    are quashed and acquittals entered.  The remaining convictions are affirmed.  The
    3½ year sentence is varied to 2 years.</p>
