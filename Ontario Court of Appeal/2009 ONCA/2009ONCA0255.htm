  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    core issue on appeal is whether a miscarriage of justice occurred in this
    case due to the ineffective representation of the appellant at trial by his
    counsel.  The appellant argues that his trial counsel failed to advise him
    of the potential consequences of pleading guilty on June 9, 2008 to various
    charges including, in particular, the charge of breaching the terms of his
    conditional sentence, imposed on March 28, 2008.  Indeed, the appellant goes
    further and contends that his lawyers actively misled him by indicating that
    he would not be sentenced to any further term of incarceration if he pled
    guilty and had all his outstanding charges dealt with together.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    our view, the appellant’s contention is simply unsustainable on this record.   The
    appellant was no stranger to the criminal justice system.  On the contrary,
    he had a lengthy criminal record.  The transcript amply demonstrates that
    he understood the proceedings in which he was involved, was an active participant
    in the proceedings involving his guilty pleas both on March 7, 2008 in respect
    of his original set of offences, and again on June 9, 2008 in respect of
    the breach by him of his conditional sentence and associated charges.  Given
    his background and experience, it simply strains credulity to suggest that
    this offender did not fully appreciate that he risked a custodial sentence
    on conviction for breach of his conditional sentence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    on March 7, 2008, the Crown acceded to a conditional sentence although the
    offences then in question clearly supported a jail term.  In so doing, the
    Crown made it abundantly clear on the record that if the appellant breached
    the conditional sentence imposed, the Crown would seek a significant jail
    term.  The appellant in fact breached the conditional sentence less than
    three weeks later.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    addition, in response to the allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel,
    the appellant’s junior trial counsel produced a memorandum to file dated
    May 2, 2008 – that is, dating from well before the date on which the appellant
    entered his guilty plea to the breach charges on June 9, 2008 – which confirmed
    that the appellant was clearly told on that date that “jail time was likely
    going to be involved” and that the Crown was “going to ask [that] he be thrown
    back in jail” on sentencing for his fresh offences.  There is absolutely
    no evidence to support the appellant’s late-breaking assertion on cross-examination
    in this proceeding that this memorandum was an after-the-fact fabrication
    by counsel.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    accept that trial counsels’ practice and file management measures in this
    case may well have been deficient.  Indeed, counsel failed to attend a potentially
    important judicial pre-trial conference.  We also agree that trial counsels’
    communications with the appellant may have been less frequent and less comprehensive
    than was prudent in the circumstances.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    we are simply not persuaded that there is any justification for the appellant’s
    claim that when deciding to enter guilty pleas on June 9, 2008, he did not
    appreciate that he ran the risk of receiving a custodial sentence.  On the
    contrary, we are satisfied that the appellant appreciated that he bore this
    risk for the breach of his conditional sentence.  The evidence falls far
    short of supporting the appellant’s bald assertion that he was misled by
    his lawyers in this regard.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly,
    we would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant also argues that the facts relied on by the Crown at trial did
    not support a conviction on the charge of possession of property knowing
    that it was obtained by the commission of crime.  On this record, there is
    no basis on which to find that the appellant converted the cheques at issue
    from one use to another.  The authority relied on by the Crown does not apply
    and accordingly, the conviction on this charge cannot stand.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    note that during the course of oral argument before this court, the appellant’s
    counsel wisely abandoned the appellant’s sentence appeal given that the Crown
    had served a ‘<i>Hill</i>’ notice that it would seek to change the custodial
    portion of the appellant’s sentence by including in it the community service
    portion of the conditional sentence.  The ‘<i>Hill</i>’ notice became ineffective
    when the appellant abandoned his sentence appeal.  This decision by counsel
    had the practical effect of saving the appellant an additional five and one-half
    months in custody as we would have given effect to the Crown’s request.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly,
    the appeal is allowed in part by setting aside the possession of property
    obtained by crime conviction, above described.  In all other respects, the
    conviction appeal is dismissed.</p>
