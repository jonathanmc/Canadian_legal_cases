style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This dispute has its genesis in the failed redevelopment
    of a resort property in northern
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario
    known as Minaki Lodge.  The appellant,
    Parkland Plumbing &amp; Heating Ltd. (“Parkland”), is one of 14 construction
    lien claimants who registered liens totalling approximately $875,000 under the <i>Construction Lien Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.30
    (the “Act”) in respect of services or materials provided to the improvement of
    the property during the redevelopment project.  The sole issue on this appeal is whether the liens have priority under
    the Act over a $5 million mortgage on the property held by the respondent, Celestine
    Mortgage Corporation (“Celestine”).  To
    resolve this priority competition, we are required to consider whether
    Celestine was an owner of the property within the meaning of that term under s.
    1(1) and for the purpose of the priorities scheme established by s. 78 of the
    Act.  If Celestine was an owner of the
    mortgaged property, and no statutory exception otherwise applies, the liens
    rank in priority ahead of Celestine’s mortgage by operation of the general
    priorities rule set out under s. 78(1) of the Act.</p>

    is the president and sole shareholder and director of Celestine.  He is also the sole owner and director of Land
    Development Corporation (“LDC”) and the Archer Group of Companies (the “Archer
    Group”).  In early 2002, Archer caused
    the respondent, Minaki Lodge Resort 2002 Inc. (“Minaki Inc.”), to be
    incorporated for the purpose of acquiring and redeveloping Minaki Lodge.  Archer became the president, chief operating
    officer and a director, and his wife became the sole shareholder and a director,
    of Minaki Inc.</p>

    Lodge for the sum of $1.95 million.  On
    April 13, 2002 – the day of closing – a $1 million first mortgage in favour of
    Celestine was registered against title to Minaki Lodge (the “First Mortgage”).  Two days later, Minaki Inc. acquired several adjoining
    lots (the “Adjoining Lots”) for $250,000.<span class=MsoFootnoteReference> <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>By its terms, the First Mortgage: (i) provided
    for its syndication to investors; (ii) permitted the substitution of a new
    mortgage for the First Mortgage; and (iii) required Minaki Inc. to obtain fire
    insurance on Minaki Lodge and authorized Celestine to obtain the requisite fire
    insurance if Minaki Inc. failed to do so.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On the findings of the trial judge, the acquisition
    of the Mortgaged Premises was financed by Celestine with funds provided by LDC
    in exchange for a syndicated interest in the First Mortgage.  None of the purchase monies was furnished
    directly by Celestine or Minaki Inc.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As the redevelopment project proceeded, various
    trades became involved and additional financing was made available to Minaki
    Inc. by Celestine, LDC, the Archer Group and third parties.  The first lien concerning improvements to the
    Mortgaged Premises arose on April 26, 2002, when the first services and
    materials were supplied for the redevelopment project.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

    been advanced to Minaki Inc., most of which was provided by LDC (approximately $2.58
    million).  Celestine’s direct
    contributions totalled $680,000, while the Archer Group advanced $40,000.    </p>

    discharged and replaced by a new $5 million mortgage in favour of Celestine (the
    “Second Mortgage”).  Like the First Mortgage,
    it required Minaki Inc. to obtain fire insurance on the Mortgaged Premises and
    authorized Celestine, on Minaki Inc.’s default of this obligation, to obtain
    the necessary insurance itself and to add the cost thereof to the indebtedness
    secured by the Second Mortgage.</p>

    issued a series of promissory notes payable to LDC, Celestine, Archer and the
    Archer Group in respect of past advances.  After the issuance of the promissory notes, LDC, Celestine, Archer and
    the Archer Group continued to advance further funds to Minaki Inc.</p>

    to have been in considerable financial difficulty.  The first lien was formally registered on May
    8, 2003.  The registration of numerous
    additional liens soon followed.

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Archer closed Minaki Lodge on Labour Day weekend
    in September 2003.  About five weeks later,
    on October 13, 2003, the main building at Minaki Lodge was destroyed by
    fire.  On the record before this court,
    the cause of the fire is unclear.  </p>

    by the fire, and (c) Celestine’s power of sale proceedings, Celestine and the
    Archer Group continued to advance funds to Minaki Inc. and to make payments
    directly to Minaki Inc.’s creditors (other than the lien claimants) throughout
    late 2003.  In the case of the Archer
    Group, these payments continued until the end of February 2004.     </p>

    various lienholders’ actions against Minaki Inc. and Celestine were
    consolidated and
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Parkland was granted carriage
    of the consolidated action.  The trial
    proceeded before Jarvis J. in Kenora in August 2005.  At trial, the parties agreed that the
    priority dispute was the preliminary question to be determined and that the
    adjudication of other issues would proceed separately.  As a result, for the purpose of the trial, the
    respondents did not challenge the validity of the liens.  Instead, the central issue was whether
    Celestine was an “owner” of the Mortgaged Premises within the meaning of s.
    1(1) and the s. 78 priorities scheme of the Act.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge made the following key findings
    of fact: (i) Archer was the directing mind of and had complete control over the
    redevelopment of the Mortgaged Premises; (ii) Archer’s dealings and those of
    his companies (including Celestine) with the redevelopment project were not at
    arm’s length but, rather, “were entirely under the control and whim of Archer”;
    (iii) Celestine and Minaki Inc. were indistinguishable; (iv) the Second Mortgage
    “subsumed” the First Mortgage; (v) the advances to Minaki Inc. by Archer and
    his companies “were done from time to time as participants in the mortgage and
    not formalized as a matter of convenience”; and (vi) the advances “were, in
    effect, from Celestine”.   </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At an early point in his reasons, the trial

style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";'>nd</span> ed.
    (Toronto: Carswell, 1997), at para. 1.8, suggests: “[The Act] was intended to
    correct a perceived deficiency in the protection afforded by the common law to
    construction suppliers by creating a scheme of rights in favour of those
    suppliers, and it provides a method for the assertion and enforcement of those
    rights.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Under s. 14(1) of the Act, a person who supplies
    services or materials to an improvement for an “owner” has a lien upon the
    “interest of the owner” in the premises improved for the price of the supplied
    services or materials.  The lien arises
    and takes effect when the person first supplies services or materials to the
    improvement (s. 15(1)).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section 78(1) of the Act establishes a general
    priority in favour of lien claimants, as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><b>78</b>.
    (1)  Except as provided in this section, the
    liens arising from an improvement have priority over all conveyances, mortgages
    or other agreements affecting the owner’s interest in the premises. </p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>Thus, under s. 78(1) and subject to
    any exception in s. 78, if Celestine was an owner of the Mortgaged Premises,
    the liens have priority over the Second Mortgage.</p>

    is integral to the statutory lien created under s. 14(1) and the priority right
    afforded to lien claimants under s. 78(1) of the Act.  To be deemed an owner for the purpose of the
    Act, it is necessary that the person in question fit within the wording of the
    definition of “owner” under s. 1(1) of the Act:</p>

    Divisional Court held that the trial

    Celestine became an owner for the purpose of the Act when it failed to insist
    that Minaki Inc. place fire insurance on the Mortgaged Premises; (ii) by
    ‘lifting’ Celestine’s ‘corporate veil’ to hold that Celestine and Minaki Inc.

    <st1:address

    Divisional Court.  On the contrary, I conclude that the majority
    erred in its appreciation of the trial judge’s reasons and by failing to
    examine the substance of the overall arrangements among Archer, his companies
    and Minaki Inc. in light of the trial judge’s factual findings.  I reach this conclusion for the following
    reasons.</p>
  <h2>(a)       <u>Failure
    to obtain fire insurance</u></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The majority of the Divisional Court accepted
    the respondents’ claim, repeated before this court, that the trial judge’s
    reasons reveal that his finding of ‘ownership’ by Celestine was based on Celestine’s
    failure “to insist that Minaki [Inc.] place insurance on the buildings as
    required by the mortgage”.  The majority
    held that this was an error, reasoning that the question of insurance was “a
    matter between Celestine and Minaki [Inc.]” and that the covenant to insure was
    personal to Celestine and subject to a waiver of compliance by it.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I agree that Celestine’s failure to compel
    Minaki Inc. to honour its contractual obligation to purchase fire insurance and
    Celestine’s own failure to obtain such coverage did not render Celestine an owner
    of the Mortgaged Premises for the purpose of the Act.  No provision of the Act requires a secured
    creditor or an owner to insure premises that are the subject of construction
    improvements.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However, I do not agree that the trial judge’s finding
    of Celestine’s ownership of the Mortgaged Premises rested solely or even
    primarily on this deficiency.  In my
    view, properly read, the trial judge’s reasons indicate that his ownership finding
    was anchored on a constellation of factors including, but not limited to, the
    commercial unreasonableness of the failure to obtain fire insurance.  Several factors support this interpretation
    of the trial judge’s reasons.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First, the majority of the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court emphasized paragraph 17
    of the trial judge’s reasons in concluding that the absence of fire insurance
    was regarded by the trial judge as dispositive of the question of Celestine’s
    ownership.  In my view, paragraph 17 does
    not support this conclusion.  For
    convenience, I again reproduce paragraph 17, with the relevant passages
    highlighted:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[17] Archer has <i>failed
    to act in a reasonable commercial fashion</i> and in so doing, he has <i>willingly compromised the interests of the
    plaintiffs.  These acts and omissions</i> clearly indicate that Celestine and Minaki [Inc.] were indistinguish-able.  It is my finding and conclusion that <i>Celestine’s failure in this regard</i> was a
    decision of an “owner” and for that reason it has no priority over the lien
    claimants.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although these comments might have been
    expressed more clearly, paragraph 17 as a whole reveals that the trial judge’s finding
    of Celestine’s ownership was linked to the commercial unreasonableness of the
    overall course of conduct by Archer, Celestine and Minaki Inc. in respect of the
    redevelopment project.  Celestine’s and
    Minaki Inc.’s failure to obtain fire insurance was only one aspect of the
    conduct scrutinized by the trial judge.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second, the trial judge’s comments regarding the
    absence of fire insurance must be understood in context and in light of the
    entirety of his reasons.  Immediately
    before the impugned comments at paragraph 17 of his reasons, the trial judge
    stated:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[14]     I
    accept the evidence of Herb LeGrange, who said that he had taken part in a
    discussion with Archer and an investor at the Lodge on Labour Day weekend,
    2003.  Archer said that the possibility
    of lien claimants was of no concern to him.  The interests of lien claimants could easily be defeated by way of
    foreclosure by Celestine.  Mr. LeGrange
    testified in a direct responsive manner.  There is no doubt that he has his own issues with Archer but I found his
    evidence to be reasonable and consistent with Archer’s striking lack of concern
    for the lien claimants demonstrated in his own evidence.  Mr. LeGrange was not cross-examined.  In summary, I find that Archer cared nothing
    for the lien claimants and decided that they should bear the risk of fire loss
    by failing to have Celestine insist on the placement of insurance.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[15]     Archer
    is a sophisticated businessman.  He took
    a calculated risk regarding the fire insurance and can only have done so to
    avoid the cost.  He believed his own
    interests were adequately protected by the value of the land.  His own decision was a strategic one.  When necessary he tried to place the
    insurance and had already done on leased equipment at the insistence of the
    lessors.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[16]     No
    commercial lender would have advanced funds continuously to an owner who made
    no payments, principal or interest, nor would such a lender have advanced funds
    without having fire insurance in place.  It is also important to note that Celestine made no subsearches of the
    title of Minaki [Inc.] before making advances.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It is true that the trial judge mentioned the
    absence of fire insurance several times.  However, read in combination with paragraph 17, the above-quoted
    passages from his reasons confirm that he considered the following factors in
    determining whether the evidence established that Celestine was an owner of the
    Mortgaged Premises:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(i)        the evidence of Archer’s “acts and
    omissions” as a commercial lender – acting through Celestine – and as the directing
    mind of the redevelopment project, including: </p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="DoubleIndentQuote">(a)       his motivation in refraining from ensuring
      that fire insurance was obtained, </p>
    <p class="DoubleIndentQuote">(b)       the continued advance of funds – through
      Archer’s various companies – to Minaki Inc. although no payments had been made
      on either the First or Second Mortgages, and</p>
    <p class="DoubleIndentQuote">(c)       Celestine’s failure to protect the
      priority of the advances by determining – prior to each advance – whether liens
      had been registered on title against the Mortgaged Premises; </p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(ii)
          Mr. LeGrange’s evidence of Archer’s
    cavalier dis-regard for the interests of the lienholders; </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(iii)
        Archer’s own testimony regarding the
    liens and the redevelopment project; and </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(iv)
         the evidence establishing that
    Celestine and Minaki Inc. were “indistinguishable”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge’s comments about the absence of
    fire insurance must also be understood in the context of his earlier factual
    findings that: (i) Archer was the directing mind of and had complete control
    over the redevelopment project; and (ii) Archer’s dealings and those of his
    companies with the redevelopment project were not at arm’s length but, rather,
    “were entirely under the control and whim of Archer”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, the trial judge’s holding of
    Celestine’s ownership was also grounded in his assessment of Archer’s
    credibility.  The trial judge indicated
    that Archer’s failure to fulfill a trial undertaking concerning the financial
    circumstances of his companies and his inconsistent trial testimony regarding
    the existence of financial statements for those companies, “greatly
    undermine[d] Archer’s credibility as a witness”.  The trial judge also regarded Archer’s
    testimony as establishing an intent to arrange the corporate structure for the
    redevelopment project in his own self-interest, so as to defeat the interests
    of the lienholders.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I conclude, therefore, that the majority of the
    <st1:Street

    Divisional Court
    misapprehended the basis for the trial judge’s finding that Celestine was an

    veil of Celestine so as to find it to be an ‘owner’ under the [Act]”.  Relying on <i>Phoenix, supra</i>, and <i>Big Creek

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Minaki [Inc.] was in no way interposing the
    corporate body of Celestine between it and any subsequent lien holders.  Its mortgage was first in place and later
    subsumed into the [Second Mortgage], before any lien holder was
    registered.  Celestine was a lender, and
    the funds used by Celestine to fund the project came from a group of syndicated
    mortgagees who invested their own personal or corporate funds in the syndicated
    mortgage given to Minaki [Inc.].  How can
    this set-up not be at arm’s length?</p>

    the lien claimant’s repeated representations that it was the “owner”, “joint
    owner” or “agent” of the owner established such a close identification between
    the lien claimant and the actual owner of the property as to warrant the
    discharge of the liens on the basis that they contravened the principle that an

    it was unnecessary to lift the corporate veil to establish the lien claimant’s

    entirely consistent with piercing the corporate veil of a corporation to
    resolve a priorities dispute under the Act where – as here – the necessary evidential
    foundation is established and the interests of justice will be furthered by so
    doing.  Indeed, the jurisprudence of the

    “request[ed]” an improvement to the premises; and (iii) the improvement to the

    defined under s. 1(1) of the Act as follows: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>“interest in the premises” means an estate or
    interest of any nature, and includes a statutory right given or reserved to the
    Crown to enter any lands or premises belonging to any person or public

    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional
    Court was of the opinion that none of the work at
    Minaki Lodge was done at Celestine’s request and that “Celestine never had any
    dealings with any lien claimant nor does its name appear on any document.”  The majority also held that the trial judge
    erred by relying on <i>Muzzo</i>, stating that <i>Muzzo</i> is “quite a different case from
    Celestine, in that [Celestine] had no negotiations with any lienholder, nor did
    it have any say in any of the building that was taking place.” </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>These comments suggest that the majority

style='"Times New Roman"'>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The absence of direct dealings between the
    person said to be an owner under the Act and construction suppliers is only one
    factor to consider in examining the relation-ship between the parties.  It is not determinative.  Were it otherwise, a developer could easily
    escape its obligations to suppliers by the simple device of arranging for an
    associated or related company to directly engage suppliers for the provision of
    services or materials.  This would defeat
    the intended protection provided to lienholders under the Act.  For this reason, the courts have recognized
    that a “request” for work to be done may be inferred from the totality of the
    circumstances, viewed in light of the substance of the relationship between the
    parties:

    meaning of “owner” under s. 1(1)(d) of the <i>Mechanics’
    Lien Act</i>, R.S.O. 1970, c. 267, a predecessor statute to the current
    Act.  The court considered
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <i>Phoenix</i>, <i>Northern Electric</i> and <i>Cipriani</i> and, consistent with these
    authorities, concluded that a request by a person to have work performed could
    be inferred from all the circumstances of the case.  Thus, in <i>Muzzo</i>,
    a vendor of subdivision land was held to be an owner for the purpose of a lien claim
    where, following the sale transaction, the vendor remained the registered owner
    of the land and retained the rights to approve building plans and to repurchase
    the land on certain events.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When adverting to <i>Muzzo</i>, the trial judge in this case recognized, correctly, that
    cases in which the meaning of “owner” under the Act or its predecessor statutes
    has been considered are highly fact-specific.  Moreover, care must be exercised when examining cases – like <i>Muzzo</i> – that involve ownership inquiries
    under legislation that differs from the Act.  No doubt with these considerations in mind, in respect of <i>Muzzo</i> the trial judge said merely that
    the question of ownership by a mortgagee was considered in that case “in <i>somewhat</i> similar circumstances”
    (emphasis added).  He also accurately
    observed: “There is no question, however, that mortgagees have been found to
    have committed the acts of an owner and have lost their priority.” </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The claim that Celestine did not request any of
    the work undertaken at Minaki Lodge rests on the proposition that Celestine
    operated independently from Archer, Archer’s other companies, and Minaki Inc.  This flies in the face of the trial judge’s
    finding that Celestine and Minaki Inc. were indistinguishable, a finding that I
    have concluded was open to the trial judge on the evidence.  It follows that requests by Minaki Inc. or by
    Archer on behalf of Minaki Inc. for the provision of services or materials from
    suppliers constituted requests by Celestine.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I note one additional factor.  As in <i>Muzzo</i> with respect to the arrangements involving the developer and the vendor, Minaki
    Inc. was obliged under the First and Second Mortgages to construct the
    redevelopment in accordance with plans and specifications approved by Celestine
    or its designate if any part of the secured indebtedness was occasioned “in
    development of the Land”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In other words, to the extent that the funds
    advanced constituted a construction loan, Celestine’s involvement with the
    plans and design of the Mortgaged Premises was required.  The record indicates that as Celestine did
    not require Minaki Inc. to prepare the necessary plans and specifications, it
    did not participate in the approval of these documents.  Nonetheless, some of the funds advanced under
    the Second Mortgage were utilized to finance the construction of the
    redevelopment of Minaki Lodge.  As in <i>Muzzo</i>, therefore, Celestine was
    contractually entitled to become directly involved in the building project.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I turn now to the third and final prerequisite
    for ownership under the Act, which requires that the improvement must have been
    made under at least <i>one</i> of the
    following conditions: (i) upon the credit of, (ii) on behalf of, (iii) with the
    privity or consent of, or (iv) for the direct benefit of, the alleged owner:
    see <i>Phoenix</i>, at p. 218.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although the trial judge did not expressly
    mention this part of the statutory ownership test, his reasons reveal that it
    too was satisfied in this case.  It is
    inherent in the trial judge’s findings, which I have previously described, that
    Minaki Inc. and Celestine constituted inseparable parts of a joint enterprise
    with Archer, LDC and the Archer Group for the purpose of the redevelopment
    project.  As a result, improvements to
    the premises carried out on behalf of Minaki Inc. and for its benefit were also
    undertaken on Celestine’s behalf and for its direct benefit.  Thus, the final requirement of the statutory
    definition of “owner” was also met in this case.   </p>
  <h2>            (2)       Other Issues</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In light of my conclusion that Celestine was an
    owner of the Mortgaged Premises, it is unnecessary to address Parkland’s
    alternative submission that even if Celestine was not an owner, the Divisional
    Court erred by holding that the Second Mortgage has priority over the liens to
    the extent of the funds advanced to Minaki Inc. to acquire the Mortgaged
    Premises.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However, the effect of the conclusion that
    Celestine was an owner of the Mortgaged Premises on the priorities dispute
    between the parties remains to be considered.  This issue involves two related questions.  First, given that Celestine was an owner, what
    are the priorities of the liens and the Second Mortgage under the s. 78
    priorities scheme of the Act?  Second,
    does s. 78(3) of the Act create a special “owner’s priority” exception to the
    s. 78(1) general priorities rule, as asserted by the respondents?</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>These questions may be dealt with
    summarily.  As I have indicated, s. 78(1)
    of the Act establishes the general rule that all liens arising from an
    improvement have priority over all mortgages affecting the owner’s interest in
    the premises.  This rule is subject to
    any applicable exception otherwise provided under s. 78.  The issue, therefore, is whether any of the
    s. 78 exceptions are triggered in this case so as to deprive
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Parkland
    of the priority status otherwise attaching to its lien under s. 78(1).  In my opinion, none of the s.&nbsp;78
    exceptions, including the s. 78(3) exception, applies to displace the priority
    con-ferred on
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Parkland’s lien by s.&nbsp;78(1)
    of the Act.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To begin, the controlling principle of s. 78 of
    the Act is that “the value of improve-ments to real property is to be preserved
    for the benefit of the persons who made them”: see Charles G.T. Wiebe and
    Markus Rotterdam in <i>Construction
    Remedies: Beyond the Lien, Mortgagees and Lien Claimants</i> (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Toronto: Ontario Bar Association, 2008), at
    p. 2.  The s. 78 exceptions to this
    principle are concerned with priority conflicts between lien claims and
    transfers or dispositions of an owner’s interest in the premises.  See McGuinness, <i>supra</i>, at paras. 5.55, 5.127 and 5.130.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In other words, the s. 78 statutory exceptions
    to the s. 78(1) priorities rule are directed at conflicts between lienholders
    and persons who acquire derivative interests, i.e. the interest of the owner in
    the premises, or some interest derived from the owner’s interest.  The exceptions are not concerned with the
    owner’s interest <i>per se</i>.  As a result, a mortgagee will lose its
    priority over lien claimants where – as here – the mortgagee is held to be an
    owner for the purpose of the Act.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Nor does s. 78(3) assist the respondents.  That provision states: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Subject to subsection (2),
    and without limiting the effect of subsection (4), <i>all</i> conveyances, <i>mortgages</i> or other agree-ments <i>affecting the
    owner’s interest in the premises</i> that were registered prior to the time
    when the first lien arose in respect of an improvement have priority over the
    liens arising from the improvement to the extent of the lesser of, </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>(a) the actual value of the premises at the time
    when the first lien arose; and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>(b) the total of all amounts that prior to that
    time were,</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>(i)   advanced in the case of a mortgage, and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>(ii) advanced or
    secured in the case of a conveyance or other agreement.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondents argue that s. 78(3) creates an
    “owner’s priority” such that, to the extent that the Second Mortgage is a
    ‘purchase money’ charge, it enjoys priority over the liens in respect of the funds
    advanced by Celestine to Minaki Inc. to acquire the Mortgaged Premises ($2.2
    million).  In the circumstances of this
    case, this argument must be rejected.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section 78(3) deals with the priority of a
    derivative interest (like a security interest created by a mortgage) that is
    registered prior to the time when the first lien arose, in particular, advances
    made prior to the time when the making of the improvement commences:
    McGuinness, at para. 5.132.  It does not
    apply where the interest in the premises in respect of which priority is
    claimed is that of an owner.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Put somewhat differently, the language of s.
    78(3) confirms that it is concerned with conveyances, mortgages or other
    agreements that <i>affect</i> an existing
    interest of an owner in the premises, as distinct from those that <i>create</i> an owner’s interest in the
    premises.  The priorities contemplated by
    s. 78(3) assume that an owner’s interest in the premises already exists.  None of the cases relied on by the
    respondents to advance their s. 78(3) claim involved a purchase money mortgage
    where the mortgagee was held to be an owner under the Act.  </p>
