    liability policies are deemed to provide for the statutory accident benefits (the
    “benefits”) set out in the <i>Statutory
    Accident Benefits Schedule – Accidents on or after November 1, 1996</i> (O.
    Reg. 403/96).  Section 268(2)(1) of the Act
    sets out a series of rules for determining against which insurer an injured occupant
    of a vehicle has recourse for the payment of the benefits.  Section 268(3) provides that an insurer
    against whom an occupant has recourse is liable to pay those benefits.  Section 268(2)(1)(iv) makes the Motor Vehicle
    Accident Claims Fund (the “Fund”) responsible for payment of the benefits if
    none of the insurers listed in ss. 268(2)(1)(i), (ii) or (iii) are liable to
    pay the benefits.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ontario Regulation 283/95, entitled “Disputes Between Insurers”
    (the “Dispute Regulation”), directs that disputes as to which insurer is
    required to pay the benefits under s. 268 shall be settled in accordance with
    the Regulation.  The Dispute Regulation
    does two things.  First, it requires that
    the first insurer to receive a completed application for benefits pay those
    benefits pending resolution of any dispute among the insurers as to the
    obligation to pay the benefits:  s. 2.  Second, the Dispute Regulation provides for the
    resolution by way of arbitration under the <i>Arbitration
    Act, 1991</i>, S.O. 1991, c. 17, of disputes among insurers over which of those
    insurers bears the ultimate burden of paying the benefits:  s. 7(1).</p>

line-height:normal;'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A dispute arose between the appellant, Progressive
    Casualty Insurance Company of
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    (“Progressive”), and the Fund over who bore the responsibility for paying benefits
    to an occupant of a motor vehicle who had been seriously injured in an
    accident.  The Fund paid the benefits
    pending resolution of that dispute.  The
    Fund eventually sued Progressive seeking a declaration that Progressive was
    liable to pay the benefits, and claiming restitution from Progressive in the
    amount of the benefits the Fund had paid to the occupant.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Did the Superior Court have jurisdiction to

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Was the Progressive automobile policy in effect

  </blockquote>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge held:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left" style="text-align:left;
"><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Symbol;'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Fund could sue Progressive for a declaration
      and restitution, and was not obliged to proceed by way of arbitration under the
      Dispute Regulation.</p>
    <p align="left" style="text-align:left;
"><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Symbol;'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Fund was not bound by the notice
      requirements in the Dispute Regulation and, in any event, had substantially
      complied with those requirements.  Furthermore, Progressive was not prejudiced by any non-compliance.  Finally, Progressive could not rely on any
      non-compliance with the Dispute Regulation by the Fund because Progressive had
      improperly deflected the claim to the Fund when it should have been paying the
      benefits to the occupant of the vehicle pending resolution of the dispute.</p>
    <p align="left" style="text-align:left;
"><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Symbol;'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Progressive’s purported cancellation of its
      policy was ineffective.  The policy-holder
      had sufficient funds in his bank account to pay the premium had Progressive
      withdrawn the premium on the day provided for in the contract of insurance.  Unfortunately, Progressive delayed the
      withdrawal by one day, by which time there were insufficient funds in the
      account.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge concluded that as Progressive’s policy
    was in place at the time of the accident, it was obliged under the terms of s.
    268(2) of the Act to pay the benefits due to the occupant.  The trial judge granted a declaration that
    Progressive was responsible for those payments and held that the Fund was
    entitled to recover from Progressive the amounts that the Fund had paid by way
    of benefits to the occupant.  That
    recovery was subject to a determination of whether the payments made by the
    Fund were reasonable.  The Fund and
    Progressive had agreed prior to trial that the issue of the reasonableness of
    the payments would be referred to arbitration.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On appeal, Progressive submits that the Fund was
    obligated to proceed by way of arbitration under the Dispute Regulation rather
    than by way of a restitution claim in the Superior Court.  Progressive further submits that even if an
    action for restitution could be brought in the Superior Court, the notice
    provisions in the Dispute Regulation applied, and the Fund had failed to comply
    with those provisions.  Progressive submits
    that the trial judge erred in excusing the Fund from compliance with the notice
    provisions and erred in holding that Progressive, and not the Fund, should have
    been paying the benefits pending resolution of the dispute.  Progressive seeks an order setting aside the
    trial judgment and declaring that, by virtue of its non-compliance with the
    Dispute Regulation, the Fund is barred from proceeding against Progressive for
    recovery of the amount paid by way of benefits.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Progressive does not appeal from the trial judge’s
    finding that the Progressive policy had not been cancelled as of the day of the
    accident and was in full force and effect as of that date.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

    the Act, Progressive, as the insurer of the automobile in which the occupant
    was riding, was responsible for the payment of benefits to the occupant in
    priority over the Fund.  As Progressive
    no longer contends that its policy was not in place, it cannot claim that the
    Fund was responsible for paying the benefits under s. 268.  Rather, it claims that because the Fund took its
    case to the wrong forum, and failed to comply with the notice requirements of
    the Dispute Regulation, it cannot recover from Progressive the benefits it has
    paid.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Cuong Ngo was seriously injured when a vehicle in
    which he was a passenger left the road and struck a tree.  The accident happened on August 11,
    1997.  Progressive had issued an
    automobile liability policy to the driver of the automobile in which Mr. Ngo
    was a passenger.  That policy was
    effective April 22, 1997.  Progressive had
    purported to cancel that policy for non-payment of the premiums effective June
    18, 1997.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A claims adjuster from Progressive attended at the
    scene of the accident and investigated.  Three days later, Progressive advised Mr. Ngo’s social worker that its policy
    issued to the driver of the automobile had been cancelled prior to the accident.  The social worker contacted the Fund about
    applying for benefits on behalf of Mr. Ngo.  The Fund contacted Mr. Ngo’s lawyer to discuss making a proper
    application for benefits and the possibility that the benefits could be payable
    through the driver’s insurer, Progressive.  The Fund was aware that Progressive was taking the position that its
    policy had been cancelled.  Mr. Ngo, who
    had been seriously injured, had immediate and ongoing medical needs.  Some of these needs were covered by the
    benefits provided for under the Act and regulations.  The Fund agreed to pay these benefits to Mr.
    Ngo on a without prejudice basis while making further inquiries as to the
    Fund’s ultimate responsibility for the payment of those benefits.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On August 26, 1997, about two weeks after the accident,
    Progressive sent a letter to its insured, the driver of the motor vehicle, with
    a copy to Mr. Ngo, advising that Progressive’s policy had been cancelled prior
    to the accident and that there was no coverage at the time of the
    accident.  In early September, the Fund
    wrote Mr. Ngo’s counsel indicating that it appeared that there was insurance
    through the Progressive policy.  The Fund
    continued its attempts to determine whether Progressive was on coverage.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On September 19, 1997, Mr. Ngo’s lawyer sent a
    completed application for benefits on Mr. Ngo’s behalf to both the Fund and
    Progressive.  By chance, the lawyer faxed
    the completed application first to the Fund and moments later to Progressive.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In October and November 1997, the Fund continued to
    request more information from Progressive concerning the cancellation of the
    driver’s policy.  Although the Fund took
    no firm position as to Progressive’s responsibility to pay Mr. Ngo’s benefits,
    it did, on October 9, 1997, advise Progressive that the Fund’s position was
    that Progressive was responsible for the payment of benefits due to another
    occupant of the same vehicle.  That
    occupant had been killed in the accident.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On January 16, 1998, the Fund wrote Progressive seeking
    confirmation that Progressive would take over payment of the benefits on the
    basis that the Progressive policy was in place at the time of the accident.  Discussions continued intermittently among
    the Fund, Progressive and Mr. Ngo’s lawyer.  Progressive held to its position that the driver’s policy had been
    cancelled prior to the accident and that Progressive was not responsible for
    paying Mr. Ngo’s benefits.  The Fund continued
    to pay the benefits.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Fund commenced this action in August 2002.  In the statement of claim, the Fund contended
    that Progressive’s purported cancellation of the driver’s policy was
    ineffective.  The Fund alleged that the
    benefits it had paid to or on behalf of Mr. Ngo ($776,724.51) should properly
    be paid by Progressive as the insurer of the automobile in which Mr. Ngo was an
    occupant at the time of the accident.</p>

line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In its statement of defence, Progressive argued that it
    had properly cancelled the policy with the driver and was, therefore, not
    responsible for the payment of any benefits to Mr. Ngo.  Progressive argued that under the Dispute Regulation,
    the Fund was obliged to pay Mr. Ngo’s benefits pending resolution of the
    dispute.  Progressive further alleged
    that the Fund had failed to comply with the notice provisions in the Dispute Regulation
    and failed to commence arbitration proceedings as required under the Dispute Regulation,
    and was, therefore, estopped from advancing the restitution claims set out in the
    Fund’s statement of claim.</p>

    the Superior Court would clearly have jurisdiction to entertain the Fund’s
    claim for restitution and declaratory relief:  see <i>Minister of Consumer and Commercial
    Relations v. Employers Mutual Liability Insurance Company of Wisconsin</i> (1980), 28 O.R. (2d) 397 (C.A.).  Progressive contends that the mandatory language of the Dispute Regulation
    signals the Legislature’s intent to move jurisdiction over s. 268 priority
    disputes exclusively to an arbitrator.  Progressive submits that the Fund is an insurer for the purpose of s.
    268 and is subject to the mandatory arbitration procedure described in the Regulation.</p>

    appendix to these reasons.  The
    provisions of the Regulation material to the jurisdictional issue are set out
    below:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;
'>1. All disputes as to which insurer is required to pay benefits under section 268
    of the Act shall be settled in accordance with this Regulation.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;
'>2. The first insurer that receives a completed application for benefits is
    responsible for paying benefits to an insured person pending the resolution of
    any dispute as to which insurer is required to pay benefits under section 268
    of the Act.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>7. (1) If the
    insurers cannot agree as to who is required to pay benefits … the dispute shall
    be resolved through an arbitration under the <i>Arbitration Act, 1991</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>(2) The insurer
    paying benefits under section 2, any other insurer against whom obligations to
    pay benefits is claimed … may initiate the arbitration but no arbitration may
    be initiated after one year from the time the insurer paying benefits under section
    2, first gives notice under section 3.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>8. (1) Except as
    provided in this Regulation, the <i>Arbitration
    Act, 1991</i> applies to an arbitration under this Regulation.  </p>

line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Dispute Regulation does not define the word
    “insurer”.  Until the 2007 decision of
    this court in <i>Allstate</i> holding that the
    Fund is an insurer, the Fund had always taken the position that it was not an
    insurer for the purpose of the Dispute Regulation but could, if it saw fit,
    avail itself of the arbitration process set out in the Dispute Regulation.  Consequently, when the Fund disputed its
    obligation to pay s. 268 benefits, it sometimes proceeded by way of arbitration
    and sometimes made a restitution claim in the Superior Court.  Various trial level decisions supported the
    Fund’s position that it was not an insurer and could, if it chose to do so, proceed
    by way of a restitution claim:  see, for
    example, <i>Ontario (Minister of Finance) v.
    Allstate Insurance Co.</i> (2001), 14 M.V.R. (4th) 72 (S.C.); <i>Ontario (Minister of Finance) v. ING Halifax</i> (2003), 15 C.C.L.I. (4th) 281 (S.C.).</p>

line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I cannot agree that the Fund relied on the
    jurisprudence in proceeding as it did in 1997.  This court did not pronounce on whether the Fund was an insurer for the
    purpose of the Dispute Regulation until 2004.  Nor, in my view, is there anything to suggest that the Fund relied on trial
    decisions in making the decisions it did in 1997 and 2002.  It is, however, fair to say that those responsible
    for making the necessary decisions on behalf of the Fund reasonably interpreted
    the word “insurer” in the Dispute Regulation as not including the Fund:  see <i>Ontario
    Insurance Commission Bulletin No. A-05/95</i>, May 29, 1995.</p>

    17 C.C.L.I. (4th) 2 (C.A.), decided some two and a half years after this
    lawsuit was commenced, this court addressed the argument that the Fund was an
    insurer for the purpose of the Dispute Regulation, was obliged to proceed by
    way of arbitration under that Regulation, and could not proceed by way of a
    restitution claim in the Superior Court.  In rejecting that argument, the court held that the Fund was not an
    insurer for the purpose of the Dispute Regulation.  The court also held, presumably on the
    assumption that the process set out in the Dispute Regulation was available to
    the Fund, that the Dispute Regulation did not remove the Fund’s right to
    proceed by way of an action for restitution “in a proper case”.</p>

    the Superior Court’s jurisdiction to adjudicate the Fund’s claim for a

    held that the Fund was an insurer for the purpose of the Dispute
    Regulation.  In <i>Allstate</i>, the Fund had chosen to proceed by way of
    arbitration.  The arbitrator ruled in the
    Fund’s favour.  Allstate appealed,
    relying on <i>Kalinkine</i>.  The Superior Court judge reluctantly allowed
    the appeal and held that in light of <i>Kalinkine</i>,<i> </i>the arbitrator did not have
    jurisdiction to consider the Fund’s claim.  Laskin J.A., speaking for a five-person court, began by rejecting the
    Fund’s argument that it could, at its option, either arbitrate under the
    Dispute Regulation or sue for restitution.  He said at para. 34:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[E]ither the
    Fund is an insurer under the Regulation and bound by all its provisions, or it
    is not an insurer and cannot take advantage of any of the provisions of the
    Regulation.  <u>If it is an insurer, it
    must arbitrate, not litigate, any dispute.</u>  If it is not an insurer, absent any agreement to arbitrate, it must
    litigate disputes with licensed insurers over the payment of accident benefits.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After a cogent analysis of the context and the language
    of the Dispute Regulation, Laskin J.A. concluded at para. 47:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The Fund is an
    insurer under Regulation 283 and, where it disputes its obligation to pay
    benefits, <u>it must resolve that dispute, not in the court, but in accordance
    with the arbitration process under the Regulation.</u>  [Emphasis added.]  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the reasoning in <i>Allstate</i> stopped with the unequivocal pronouncement quoted above, Progressive’s argument
    that the Superior Court had no jurisdiction would carry the day.  However, my colleague, Laskin J.A., went on
    at para. 48 to indicate:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In <i>Kalinkine</i>, <u>this court said that
    Regulation 283 did not preclude the Fund from seeking restitution in the courts
    “in a proper case”.  I agree.</u>  <i>Kalinkine</i> itself was a proper case because there was nothing to arbitrate.  Whether there are any other “proper cases”
    need not be decided on these appeals.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for Progressive does not claim that the Dispute
    Regulation completely removes the jurisdiction of the court in disputes over
    the liability to pay s. 268 benefits.  Counsel accepts the existence of the “proper case” exception to the
    jurisdiction of the arbitrator identified in <i>Allstate</i>.  Those cases which
    have interpreted other statutory provisions as entirely ousting the
    jurisdiction of the court and granting exclusive jurisdiction to an arbitrator
    have no application here.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Progressive’s jurisdictional argument turns on whether
    the circumstances of this case bring it within the “proper case” exception so
    as to permit the Fund to proceed by way of a restitution claim.  I approach this submission by recognizing that
    while <i>Allstate</i> borrows the phrase
    “proper case” from <i>Kalinkine</i>, the
    phrase is used differently in <i>Allstate</i> than it was in <i>Kalinkine</i>.  In <i>Kalinkine</i>,
    the court found that the Fund was not bound by the Dispute Regulation.  The phrase “proper case” in that context
    referred to any case in which a common law action for restitution could be
    brought by the Fund.  In <i>Allstate</i>, having found that the Fund was
    bound by the Dispute Regulation and was required to arbitrate disputes, the
    court then recognized that an action for restitution was appropriate in the “proper
    case”.  The phrase is used in <i>Allstate</i> to carve out an exception to
    the generally applicable requirement that s. 268 disputes must be arbitrated in
    accordance with the Dispute Regulation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are strong indications that the “proper case”
    exception should be narrowly construed.  In <i>Allstate</i>, at para. 35, the
    court, without attempting an exhaustive definition of the “proper case”
    exception, acknowledged that only the “rare case” would fall within that
    exception.  The Dispute Regulation is
    made pursuant to s. 121(1)(10.4) of the Act and is sheltered under the strong privative
    language of s. 20 of the Act.  The clear
    language of the Dispute Regulation itself speaks to a strong preference for
    dispute resolution through the process established by that Regulation.  The “proper case” exception must also be
    carefully confined to avoid defeating the obvious purpose of the Regulation
    which is to bring about a timely, cost-efficient resolution of s. 268 disputes
    by arbitrators experienced in such matters:  <i>Allstate </i>at para. 39.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As narrow as the “proper case” exception is, however,
    it is an exception to the general rule that the Dispute Regulation governs s.
    268 disputes among insurers, including the Fund.  As it is an exception to the rule that the
    Dispute Regulation applies, the “proper case” exception must reach cases that
    are otherwise within the ambit of the Dispute Regulation.  There is no need to speak of a “proper case”
    exception permitting restitution actions in cases that are not subject to the
    Dispute Regulation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel for Progressive argues for a very narrow
    reading of the “proper case” exception.  He submits that cases like <i>Kalinkine</i>,
    where the insurer did not dispute its obligation under s. 268 but only disputed
    the forum in which the claim was brought, constitute the only kind of “proper
    case” in which it is appropriate to proceed by way of a restitution claim.  For reasons I will explain, I do not read the
    “proper case” exception that narrowly.  However,
    even if I did, it is not clear to me that Progressive would succeed on this
    appeal.  There is a strong argument that
    Progressive’s position on this appeal is exactly the same as the position of
    the insurer in <i>Kalinkine</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As I read the trial judgment in <i>Kalinkine</i>, the insurer did not concede at trial its obligation to
    pay the benefits under s. 268 of the Act.  The insurer raised factual issues (e.g. the identity of the driver) that
    were material to its obligation to pay those benefits.  The trial judge decided those factual issues
    against the insurer.  When the matter
    came to this court, the insurer conceded its primary responsibility to pay the
    s. 268 benefits and argued that the Fund could not recover the benefits the
    Fund had paid because the Fund failed to proceed by way of arbitration as it
    was required to do.  In <i>Allstate</i>, Laskin J.A., at para. 35, relied
    on the concession made on appeal when he referred to <i>Kalinkine</i> as a case “where there is no dispute to be arbitrated”
    and, therefore, a “proper case” to sue for restitution.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Progressive argued at trial that it did not have any
    responsibility under s. 268 to pay the benefits because its policy had been
    cancelled before the accident.  However,
    on appeal, Progressive, just like the insurer in <i>Kalinkine</i>, has abandoned the argument that it was not obliged to
    pay the benefits.  Having chosen not to
    dispute the trial judge’s finding that the Progressive policy was in force at
    the time of the accident, Progressive has effectively admitted that under the s.
    268 scheme, its obligation to pay the benefits to the injured occupant of the
    automobile trumps any obligation the Fund might have to pay benefits under that
    section.  Given the position now taken by
    Progressive, it could be said, just as in <i>Kalinkine</i>,
    that the dispute is no longer over which insurer is obliged to pay the benefits
    under s. 268, but is instead a dispute over the propriety of the Fund’s choice
    of forum in which to assert its claim, and the Fund’s failure to comply with
    the procedural requirements of the Dispute Regulation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am tempted to dispose of Progressive’s claim on the
    basis that it is indistinguishable from <i>Kalinkine</i>.  There is, however, a problem in doing so.  The finding that Progressive’s policy was in force
    and that it was, therefore, responsible for the benefits under s. 268, was made
    in a proceeding in which Progressive alleges the trial judge had no
    jurisdiction.  Even though Progressive
    does not take issue with that finding on appeal, I do not think that
    Progressive’s jurisdictional argument can be defeated by relying on a finding
    of fact made in the very proceeding which is the subject of the jurisdictional challenge.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I move now to an attempt to describe the reach of the
    “proper case” exception.  It is
    impossible to provide an exhaustive description of the cases that could fall
    within the exception.  No formulation
    could contemplate the variety and combination of circumstances that may arise
    for consideration.  As the phrase “proper
    case” suggests, a measure of judicial discretion must, of necessity, be
    involved in determining whether a particular case falls within that category.  I will, however, identify those criteria that
    should guide the exercise of that discretion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In drawing the boundaries of the “proper case”
    exception, it is appropriate to have regard to the purpose of s. 268 of the Act
    and the Dispute Regulation, the nature of the disputes involved, and the
    relationship of the parties involved in those disputes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The purpose of s. 268 and the Dispute Regulation is
    twofold.  They are intended to ensure
    that benefits are paid expeditiously to those who need and are entitled to receive
    them.  At the same time, these provisions
    seek to ensure that the ultimate cost of the benefits will be distributed among
    insurers and the Fund according to the priorities fixed by s. 268.  Those priorities make it clear that the Fund
    is the payor of last resort.  The process
    set out in the Dispute Regulation is designed to achieve this purpose by
    facilitating the expeditious imposition of the burden of the benefits on the
    insurer who, according to the priority system set up in s. 268, should bear
    that burden.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Dispute Regulation targets a very specific kind of
    dispute that arises where insurers or the Fund have competing views as to who
    should bear the responsibility of paying those benefits.  The injured person’s entitlement to the
    benefits is not in issue in these disputes.  The insurers and the Fund, the usual participants in a s. 268 dispute,
    are members of a small community of well-informed, sophisticated entities.  These entities routinely interact on a
    variety of automobile insurance matters and regularly address the kinds of
    problems that give rise to s. 268 disputes.  When a s. 268 dispute arises, the insurers and the Fund are not parties
    engaged in a one-off piece of litigation.  Rather, they are stakeholders in the ongoing operation of the multi-million
    dollar automobile insurance industry.  That industry is carefully regulated.  Insurers and the Fund play a significant and ongoing role in formulating
    those regulations.  The interest of the
    Fund and the insurers goes well beyond success or failure in a specific dispute.  Their interest is in maintaining the ongoing
    effective operation of the regulatory scheme which they have played a
    significant role in organizing.  That
    scheme includes the resolution of priority disputes under s. 268.  As described above, the ultimate goal of s.
    268 and the Dispute Regulation is to distribute the cost of paying the benefits
    among insurers and the Fund according to the priorities established in s. 268
    and elsewhere in the Act:  see, for
    example, s. 275.  The Fund and the
    insurers have a common interest in seeing that goal achieved.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having regard to the purpose of the provisions, the
    nature of s. 268 disputes, and the ongoing relationship of the parties to those
    disputes, the “proper case” exception exists for those cases where the merits
    of the dispute cannot be reached through the Dispute Regulation and there is no
    prejudice caused to the defending party by addressing those merits in the
    context of a restitution claim.  Without
    laying down any hard and fast rules, I suggest that the answer to the two
    questions posed below will assist in identifying those cases that constitute a
    “proper case” to permit a party to proceed by way of a restitution claim:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p align="left" style="text-align:left;
"><span
style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Symbol;'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Were the ultimate parties to the s. 268 dispute
      engaged in a dispute over payment of benefits within the time limits set out in
      s. 3 of the Dispute Regulation and did the parties, either expressly or by
      implication from their conduct, choose not to proceed under the Dispute
      Regulation?</p>
    <p align="left" style="text-align:left;

style='font-size:11.0pt;font-family:Symbol;'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Was arbitration in accordance with the process
      set out in the Dispute Regulation no longer possible when objection was first taken
      to a party proceeding by way of a restitution claim?</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If the answer to both questions is yes, a common law
    action for restitution provides the only way that the dispute can be resolved
    according to the priority scheme established in the Act.  The choice is between permitting a
    restitution action in which the merits of the claim can be addressed, and potentially
    sanctioning the imposition of the burden of the s. 268 benefits on a party
    other than the party who should bear that burden under the terms of the
    Act.  If the first choice can be made without
    irreparable prejudice to the defending party, the interests of justice warrant
    treating the case as an exception to the general rule requiring arbitration
    pursuant to the Dispute Regulation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would add this caveat.  The above analysis proceeds on the premise
    established in <i>Allstate</i>, that the
    Dispute Regulation does not give the arbitrator exclusive jurisdiction.  The “proper case” exception acknowledges the
    continued jurisdiction of the court albeit a jurisdiction that is to be
    exercised in limited circumstances.  Consequently, nothing said in these reasons is intended to suggest that
    parties can, by their mutual consent, give a court jurisdiction it does not
    have.  Nor is anything in these reasons
    intended to address the nature and scope of the jurisdiction granted to
    arbitrators and others in other parts of the Act or in other statutes.  My analysis of the reach of the “proper case”
    exception depends very much on the nature of the interests at stake in s. 268
    disputes.<b>  </b></p>

line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I will now apply these criteria to the present
    appeal.  The Fund and Progressive both
    received completed applications for benefits from the injured occupant.  Both knew early on that they disagreed as to which
    was obliged to pay those benefits.  Under
    s. 3(1) of the Dispute Regulation, either Progressive or the Fund, or both, could
    have served a written notice of dispute on the other party.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

    that notice, there will be no arbitration of the dispute under the Dispute
    Regulation.</p>

line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Instead of triggering the arbitration process, the Fund
    and Progressive chose to continue informal discussions over responsibility for payment
    of the benefits.  These discussions ran
    well beyond 90 days after Progressive and the Fund had received the completed
    applications for benefits from the occupant.  Under s. 3 of the Dispute Regulation, Progressive and the Fund had 90
    days to initiate the arbitration process by serving their notice of their dispute.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    of their dispute and their respective positions within a short time after the
    accident.  Neither suggests that it was
    unaware of the Dispute Regulation and the steps that could have been taken to
    trigger the arbitration process had it chosen to do so.  By their conduct, Progressive and the Fund effectively
    chose not to access the arbitration process to resolve their dispute.  When, many months later, it apparently became
    clear that the dispute would not be resolved, compliance with the notice
    provisions of the Dispute Regulation was no longer possible.  A lawsuit for restitution and declaratory
    relief provided the only means by which the dispute could be determined on its
    merits and the obligation to pay the benefits placed on the party who, under the
    terms of s. 268 of the Act, should bear that burden.  Absent irreparable prejudice to Progressive, I
    see no interest that would be served by closing the courtroom door on the Fund
    in these circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    restitution claim on the basis that its policy was not in place at the time of
    the accident is not compromised by allowing the Fund to proceed in Superior
    Court rather than by way of arbitration.  The only advantage Progressive loses is the ability to rely on the
    Fund’s failure to comply with the procedures set out in the Dispute Regulation,
    particularly the notice requirements in s. 3.  I would not classify this as prejudice in the relevant sense.  Indeed, Progressive itself declined to follow
    those procedures to resolve the dispute between it and the Fund.</p>

    provided the only means by which the merits of the dispute could be

    proceed by way of a restitution claim.</p>

line-height:normal;'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge, after concluding that this was a
    “proper case” to allow the Fund to proceed by way of a restitution claim, moved
    on to consider the procedural requirements of the Dispute Regulation.  The trial judge assumed, subject to a
    fairness argument based on the change in the law brought about by <i>Allstate</i>, that the procedural requirements
    in the Dispute Regulation applied to a restitution claim brought by way of
    action in the Superior Court.  I do not
    think that the procedural requirements in the Dispute Regulation have any
    application to a restitution claim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Dispute Regulation, and particularly the notice
    requirements in ss. 3 and 7, applies to disputes conducted under the
    Regulation.  Section 3 triggers the dispute
    process described in the Dispute Regulation by providing for a notice of
    dispute to be filed within the 90-day time limit described in s. 3.  Section 7 speaks of commencing an arbitration
    within a year of giving notice under s. 3.  The timeline described in these sections assumes that the dispute will
    be determined under the arbitration process set out in the Dispute
    Regulation.  In my view, the timeline
    fixed by the Dispute Regulation does not control a restitution claim brought in
    the Superior Court.  To interpret the
    Regulation otherwise would be to read it as imposing a limitation period on common
    law restitution claims brought in respect of s. 268 benefits disputes.</p>

    that this was an appropriate case in which to allow the Fund to proceed by way
    of a restitution claim, the procedural provisions in the Dispute Regulation,
    including the notice requirements, became irrelevant.  The Fund’s action was subject to the
    procedures and time limits applicable to claims for restitution brought by way
    of statement of claim in the Superior Court.  There is no suggestion that the Fund failed to comply with any of those
    requirements.</p>

    appeal and affirm the result reached at trial.  I will, however, address one further aspect of the trial judge’s
    reasons.  He held that the <i>ratio</i> in <i>Allstate</i> should not apply to this case.  He reasoned that as <i>Allstate</i> had changed the law and made the Fund subject to the
    Dispute Regulation, that change should not be applied to cases where the
    relevant events occurred before the decision in <i>Allstate</i>.  In other words,
    the trial judge held that the ruling in <i>Allstate</i> should have a prospective effect only.  He said at para. 43:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Progressive
    submitted that in <i>Allstate</i> the Court
    of Appeal intended for its decision to apply retroactively to other cases
    currently before the courts.  I do not
    think the matter is so clear.  Courts
    usually proceed cautiously when faced with an argument that a statute has
    retroactive effect – they apply the presumption that a legislature does not
    intend legislation to apply retroactively unless express provision is made for
    such an effect.  <u>Similar caution, in
    my opinion, needs to be taken when assessing the impact on outstanding cases of
    an appellate decision that has reversed the prevailing interpretation about
    procedural provisions in a statute or regulation.</u>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge went on at para. 48 to observe that the
    Fund had relied on the law “as it was understood at that time [1997]” and that
    it would be unfair to subject the Fund to the requirements “newly set down” in <i>Allstate</i> in 2007.  The trial judge ultimately concluded at para.
    50 that absent an express direction in <i>Allstate</i> making the decision applicable to cases that arose before <i>Allstate</i> was decided, the trial judge would not apply the <i>ratio</i> of <i>Allstate</i> to this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the trial judge, whose careful reasons

line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the application of the “new” law as pronounced
    in <i>Allstate</i> to this case is a
    retrospective, and not a retroactive, application of the judgment.  It would involve applying the new rule
    announced in <i>Allstate</i> to a case that,
    although involving events that occurred in 1997 and 1998, arose for judgment
    after <i>Allstate</i> was decided.  It would not involve undoing decided cases or
    changing the law as of some date prior to the release of <i>Allstate</i> – that would be a retroactive application of the law:  see Ruth Sullivan, <i>Sullivan on the Construction of Statutes</i>, 5th ed. (

    prospective only, judge-made law is by its very nature inherently retrospective
    in that it attributes legal consequences as announced in the particular case to
    the prior events that are at issue in the litigation:  see, for example, <i>Cousson v. Quan</i> (2007), 87 O.R. (3d) 241 (C.A.), at paras. 145-49,

    various forms of prospective lawmaking in constitutional cases such as <i>Canada (Attorney General) v. Hislop</i>,
    [2007] 1 S.C.R. 429, the case relied on by the trial judge, that court, as
    recently as 2000, rejected prospective judicial lawmaking in the private law
    context.  In <i>Friedmann Equity Developments Inc. v. Final Note Ltd.</i>, [2000] 1
    S.C.R. 842, the appellants argued that the court should abolish the common law
    sealed contract rule.  The respondents
    argued that the rule should be maintained in part because it had been relied on
    by persons in the ordering of their affairs and abolition of the rule would
    prejudice persons who had relied on it.  Bastarache
    J., for a unanimous five-person court, accepted the reliance argument,
    declaring at para. 51:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The abolition of
    the sealed contract rule would have the unfair result of creating uncertainty
    for those who had relied on the rule in executing their contracts.  <u>To avoid uncertainty and any unfairness to
    those parties who have structured their commercial relationships in accordance
    with the sealed contract rule, any change to the law should operate
    prospectively.  Only the legislature has
    the power to create a prospective change in the law.</u>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Bastarache J.
    implicitly rejected prospective overruling as a means of avoiding the
    unfairness and uncertainty that would be created by the judicial abolition of
    the common law sealed contract rule.  This aspect of the decision in <i>Friedmann Equity</i>, although the
    subject of criticism,<a href="#_ftn5"

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[5]</span></span></span></a> is
    consistent with a strong body of judicial authority that has rejected
    prospective judicial lawmaking as inimical to the role of the judiciary:  see, for example, <i>Re Edward and Edward</i> (1987), 39 D.L.R. (4th) 654 (Sask. C.A.), at pp. 661-64; <i>Kleinwort Benson
    Ltd. v. Lincoln City Council</i>, [1999] 2 A.C. 349 (H.L.), per Lord Goff at pp.
    378-79, 381; <i>Ha v.
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth, even
    those who advocate for prospective judicial lawmaking see it as very much the
    exception to the general rule that judge-made law is retrospective.  The argument for prospective overruling is
    made all the more difficult where the issue is one of statutory interpretation
    and not common law:  <i>National
    Westminster Bank plc</i>, per Lord Nicholls at paras. 38-41, per Lord Scott at
    para. 125.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If available
    at all, the possibility of a prospective overruling of a prior decision should
    be considered only if the party seeking that ruling demonstrates a clear and detrimental
    reliance on the prior authority.  The
    Fund made the decisions relevant to this issue in 1997 and 1998.  There is nothing in the record to suggest
    that the Fund relied on any judicial decisions in deciding not to comply with
    the Dispute Regulation.  Clearly, the
    Fund cannot argue that it relied on <i>Kalinkine</i> decided some six years
    later.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Fund
    proceeded as it did because it did not regard itself as an “insurer” for the
    purpose of the Dispute Regulation.  This
    was a reasonable, although ultimately wrong, interpretation of the Dispute Regulation.  I do not think that an erroneous, albeit
    reasonable, interpretation of a statute or a regulation justifies giving a
    judicial decision prospective effect only.  Most debates about statutory interpretation that reach an appellate
    court pit two reasonable but conflicting interpretations against each
    other.  The unsuccessful party could
    almost always argue that it proceeded on a reasonable interpretation of the
    statute and should, therefore, despite losing the statutory interpretation
    battle, not suffer the consequences of an adverse ruling.  To accept this argument would be to
    fundamentally alter the nature of judging in the common law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the trial judge erred in concluding that it
    was for him to determine the temporal scope of the new rule pronounced in <i>Allstate</i>.  If an appellate ruling is to have something
    less than its normal retrospective impact, it is for the appellate court making
    that ruling to specifically announce the limitation.  Absent the placing of any limit on the new
    rule by the appellate court announcing that rule, trial judges must apply that
    rule to subsequent cases.</p>
