style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The action arose as the result of the sale of an
    operating gravel pit by the respondents to the appellant numbered company and
    that company’<span lang=EN-US>s failure to pay
    amounts it contracted to pay under the terms of the agreements. The judgment
    against the personal appellant was on his personal guarantee.</span></p>

    central issue between the parties was whether the respondent company and its
    principals, Roger and Ken Kieswetter had given various oral warranties and
    agreements which induced the appellants to enter into the agreements pursuant
    to which they acquired this business.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The

  <blockquote>

"><span style='"Times New Roman"'>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>–
      a promise by the respondents to help the appellants make additional sales of
      product by acquiring the other 50% of the pit’s output themselves or by
      directing other business (including customers of their own) to the appellants</span></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It was the appellant’s evidence that they
    expected their pre-cast operation to use about 50% of the pit’s expected
    output.</p>
  <blockquote>

  </blockquote>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In addition it was alleged that the respondents
    warranted a profit of $2 per tonne of materials processed and that
    approximately 120,000 tonnes were to be processed each year. The evidence of
    the respondents was that no such warranties or oral agreements were made.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondents offered to provide assistance to
    the appellants as they started up and learned the business and did so. But they
    made no oral representations, warranties or promises to do so. Their only
    agreements are those reflected in the written documentation prepared in
    connection with the sale of the business and nowhere in those documents is
    there any mention of any agreements of the nature suggested by the appellants.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellants argue that the language of the
    personal guarantee:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>… in consideration of Kieswetter Resource Recovery
    Group Inc. (herein called the <span lang=EN-US>“Lender”)
    agreeing to deal with or to continue to deal with 1313192 Ontario Limited
    (herein called the “Borrower”) the undersigned hereby unconditionally
    guarantees …</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'>is evidence of and references the oral representation and
    promises made by the respondents. We disagree. Clearly this language relates to
    the fact that the respondents agreed to contract with the numbered company,
    newly incorporated for this transaction, a company without a work history,
    experience and most importantly, assets and hence the need for a personal
    guarantee from Mr. Syrier.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge made important factual findings
    which, absent palpable error, are entitled to deference in this court. He found
    that the appellant, Peter Syrier, was a very successful businessman, that he
    was represented by experienced commercial counsel throughout the transaction
    and that he engaged his own independent engineering firm to advise him in
    respect of the sale.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>He remarked that he could not understand if the
    undertakings and warranties alleged, were so important why they were not included
    in the final documents.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>He concluded that the respondents did not make
    the oral undertakings or warranties alleged and accepted the evidence of the
    respondents over that of the appellants in this respect. In addition he noted
    that there was no reference made to any alleged oral undertakings or warranties
    by the appellants until two years after the contract had been signed when they
    stopped all payments to the respondents and received a demand letter from the
    respondent’s solicitors. Indeed even in the appellants’ solicitors response to
    that demand letter there was no mention made of breach of any oral warranties
    or undertakings.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In our view the evidence overwhelmingly
    supported the trial judge’s conclusion and we would not interfere with his
    finding in this respect.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellants further argue that the trial
    judge erred in refusing to allow them to call a Mr. Thomson to give evidence
    about a purported conversation Thomson had with one of the Kieswetters in the
    spring of 2006. In our view the trial judge’s ruling was proper. The proposed
    evidence would not have assisted in determining the issues before the trial
    judge. Those issues were concerned with the formation of the contract and the
    two years following the signing of the contract in October, 1998 up until the
    time the appellants stopped making payments to the respondents.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The purported conversation took place in the
    spring of 2006 long after the signing of the contract, the stopping of payments
    due under the contract and after litigation among the parties had been ongoing
    for several years.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Having found the oral undertakings and
    warranties were not given was conclusive of the appellants’ case as it is of
    this appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We note that at trial there were two actions
    before the trial judge. In this court the appeal related to only one of the two
    actions. No appeal was taken in relation to the judgment in the action that
    related to the payment of invoices and we express no opinion on the rulings
    made in relation to that action.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the result the appeal is dismissed. Costs to
    the respondents on a partial indemnity basis fixed in the sum of $5,800
    inclusive of disbursements and GST which figure was agreed to by counsel.</p>
