  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following his trial before Rogin J. and a jury on a
    charge of second degree murder, the appellant was convicted of manslaughter and
    sentenced to eight years imprisonment. He appeals against conviction and
    sentence. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Overview</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On June 12, 2004 the deceased, Robert Phillips, was
    beaten to death in his house. The position of the Crown was that the appellant
    and a co-accused <span lang=EN-US>[Mr.
    Burkoski] </span>went to the deceased’s house to assault and rob him. During
    the course of the assault, the deceased was struck over the head several times
    and ultimately died from wounds inflicted by a blunt object. Some time later,
    the appellant and Burkoski were arrested.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The case for the Crown rested essentially on the
    evidence of Ms. Corrine Mathis. She testified that on the night of the killing,
    she drove with the appellant and Burkoski to the area of the deceased’s house.
    She claimed that while she waited in the car, the appellant and Burkoski went
    to Mr. Phillips’ house and returned a short time later. Upon their return, she
    asked the appellant if Mr. Phillips was “okay”, to which he replied “Yeah, we
    turned him on his side. He was snoring”. Ms. Mathis testified that before
    leaving the car, the appellant appeared to retrieve something from the trunk
    and upon returning from Mr. Phillips’ house, the appellant opened the trunk and
    she heard a “clunk”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s primary defence was that he took no
    part in the killing. In support of his position, he relied on alibi evidence from
    his girlfriend and pointed to frailties in Ms. Mathis’ evidence that, in his
    view, rendered her evidence next to worthless. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Conviction Appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant has raised five grounds of appeal against
    conviction. All but one of the grounds relate to alleged errors in the trial
    judge’s charge to the jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before addressing the individual grounds, we note that
    although the charge was not perfect, overall it was functionally appropriate
    and fundamentally fair. With that in mind, we turn to the individual grounds of
    appeal. </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Ground 1 – The trial judge
    misdirected the jury on evidence capable of confirming Ms. Mathis’ testimony</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As indicated, Ms. Mathis was the main Crown witness.
    Without her evidence, there was no other evidence linking the appellant to the
    killing. Given Ms. Mathis’ unsavoury background and character and the frailties
    in her testimony, the trial judge provided the jury with an extensive and
    forceful <i>Vetrovec</i> warning. He
    repeated time and again that without more it would be dangerous to convict the
    appellant on the evidence of Ms.&nbsp;Mathis. He pointed the jury to all of the
    frailties in her testimony and also alerted the jury to the many factors that necessitated
    a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning in her case,
    including her history of drug use, her disreputable lifestyle, her criminal
    record, and her favourable treatment by the police.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s primary attack on Ms. Mathis consisted
    of showing that she was a drug addict, that she was using drugs on the night of
    the killing, that she had been on a high for the better part of a week and that
    as a result, she was incapable of accurately recording, recalling, or reciting
    the events she described on the night in question, including the appellant’s
    involvement in the killing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Of the three items of evidence that the trial judge
    left to the jury as potentially confirmatory, all three were capable of showing
    that Ms. Mathis was able to accurately record, recall and recite her
    observations. The third also went some distance towards implicating the
    appellant in the killing, depending on the jury’s assessment of it<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>.
    Experienced defence counsel [not Ms. Bojanowska or Mr. Glick] took no exception
    to the items of evidence left by the trial judge as potentially confirmatory,
    despite being asked for his input in the pre-charge conference.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the three items of evidence left by the
    trial judge for the jury’s consideration were proper. In addition to those
    three items, there was a fourth item which was not left with the jury but which,
    in our view, was capable of providing strong confirmation of Ms. Mathis’
    testimony. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The fourth item of evidence relates to Ms. Mathis’
    testimony that when the appellant and his co-accused returned to the car from
    the deceased’s residence, she asked the appellant if the deceased was “okay”, to
    which the appellant replied, “Yeah, we turned him on his side. He was snoring”.
    According to Lori Poole, a paramedic who was one of the first persons to arrive
    on the scene, the deceased was lying on his side when she observed him.
    Ms.&nbsp;Poole was not cross-examined on her evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Poole’s evidence was highly probative. Indeed, in
    our view, it was capable by itself of restoring the jury’s faith in Ms. Mathis’
    testimony, such that the jury could safely rely on it to convict the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s failure to leave Ms. Poole’s evidence
    to the jury as potentially confirmatory inured to the appellant’s benefit. Moreover,
    as indicated, the three items of potentially confirmatory evidence, about which
    the appellant complains, were properly left to the jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, we would not give effect to this
    ground of appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Ground 2 – The trial judge
    erred in describing Tanya Pierce’s evidence as “useless”</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Pierce and the deceased had been involved in a
    relationship for some time and they were living together at the time of the
    deceased’s death. In her testimony, she described her stormy relationship with
    the deceased and her desire, on the night of his death, to have him beaten and
    robbed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Pierce was in the deceased’s house when he was
    killed. Although she described the events surrounding the killing, her evidence
    on that subject was riddled with inconsistencies and in the opinion of the
    trial judge, it was “useless”. That is how he described it to the jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In using that descriptor, the trial judge was
    essentially reiterating the position taken by the appellant’s counsel who, in
    his closing address, told the jury that he was not “going to stand before
    [them] and say well [Tanya Pierce] is a credible witness”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The most perfunctory review of Ms. Pierce’s evidence of
    the events surrounding the killing explains why the trial judge described her
    evidence as “useless”. This would have been apparent to the jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Be that as it may, even if the trial judge should not
    have expressed his opinion so bluntly, he made it clear to the jury on several
    occasions that it was the jury’s view of the evidence that counted, not his, and
    that if the jury disagreed with his opinion, they were duty bound to reject it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We note as well that defence counsel did not object to
    the trial judge’s characterization of Ms. Pierce’s evidence of the events in
    the house; it is only on appeal that exception is taken to it. And, as the
    Crown points out, the trial judge left other aspects of her evidence, including
    her guilty plea to manslaughter in connection with Mr.&nbsp;Phillip’s death,
    for the jury to consider in deciding whether the Crown had proved its case
    against the appellant beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the circumstances, we would not give effect to this
    ground of appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Ground 3 – The trial judge
    misdirected the jury on reasonable doubt</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his charge to the jury on reasonable doubt, the
    trial judge engaged in a demonstration designed to explain the differences
    between probable guilt, proof of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, and absolute
    guilt. In the course of the demonstration, he provided the jury with the
    following instructions:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Now Mr. Schwalm acknowledged in his jury address that
    it’s a heavy burden on the Crown. You should also remember however that it is
    next to impossible to prove anything with absolute or mathematical certainty.
    The burden on the Crown is not that high. Crown counsel is not required to
    prove guilt to an absolute certainty or mathematical certainty. That is a
    standard of proof that is impossibly high. Crown counsel must prove the essential
    elements of each offence beyond reasonable doubt. <i>However, if there is a scale about the burden on the crown, I’ll put it
    to you this way. To my extreme right, my right hand is the start of the trial.
    At the start of the trial each of these accused persons is presumed innocent.
    They are innocent because before the trial starts, there’s no evidence against
    them. Once the evidence starts to come in, the scale moves down that way</i>.
    If at the end of the evidence and the jury addresses by Mr. Schwalm and Miss&nbsp;Carroccia
    and Mr. Ducharme the scale goes down to here which is probably guilty. I’ve got
    my left hand now 2 feet away from my right hand. If that’s the best you can say
    probably guilty, they are not guilty. Because the Crown has failed to prove
    their guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. I’ll move my left hand 2 feet farther. That’s
    absolute certainty. The Crown doesn’t have to achieve that burden. That’s an
    impossible burden for the Crown to meet. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the trial judge was undoubtedly trying to be
    helpful, in our view, he should have avoided the impugned demonstration.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Beyond that, it was clearly wrong for the trial judge
    to tell the jury that accused persons are presumed innocent before the trial
    starts, when there is no evidence against them, but once the evidence starts,
    “the scales move down that way [towards guilt]”. That instruction was
    inappropriate for two reasons. First, it may have led the jury to believe that the
    presumption of innocence does not follow an accused throughout the trial.
    Second, it may have led the jury to infer that evidence elicited at trial tends
    only towards guilt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That said, the impugned instruction must be read in
    context. In the paragraph following it, the trial judge explained what he was
    attempting to demonstrate:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is
    somewhere between probably guilty and absolute certainty. It’s not absolute
    certainty but on that scale it’s closer to absolute certainty than it is to
    probably guilty. It can’t be put in percentages. That is the burden on the
    crown. It is a heavy burden. And the Crown attorney has quite properly
    acknowledged it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As well, on the page before the impugned instruction,
    the trial judge made it clear, on several occasions, that the onus of proof
    rested with the Crown, that there was no burden on the accused to prove
    anything, and that the presumption of innocence applied throughout the trial
    and remained, unless and until the jury was satisfied that the accused’s guilt had
    been proved beyond a reasonable doubt. One such example is reproduced below:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The presumption of innocence means that they each
    started this trial as an innocent person. That presumption stays with each of
    them throughout the case. It’s with them now. It stays with them during your
    deliberations. It is only defeated if and when Mr. Schwalm has satisfied you
    beyond a reasonable doubt that each of them is guilty of the crime charged.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the circumstances, while we agree that the impugned
    instruction was inappropriate, we are not persuaded that it would have misled
    the jury as the appellant suggests. Rather, we are satisfied that the jury
    would have understood what the trial judge intended by it – that probable guilt
    was not enough and that while absolute guilt need not be proved, proof beyond a
    reasonable doubt was much closer to the latter than the former. The fact that
    the jury acquitted the appellant on the charge of murder lends support to our
    conclusion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, we would not give effect to this ground of
    appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Ground 4 – The trial judge
    misdirected the jury on party liability and manslaughter</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s instructions on party liability and
    manslaughter were deficient in two respects. First, the trial judge did not
    tell the jury that if the appellant went to the deceased’s home intending to
    rob him but the jury had a reasonable doubt as to whether a reasonable person
    would have foreseen the risk of harm, the appellant was entitled to be
    acquitted. Second, the trial judge failed to make it clear that if the jury
    believed or had a reasonable doubt that although the appellant was at the
    deceased’s house, he was there solely as a passive observer, he would likewise
    be entitled to on acquittal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That said, the errors in our view were harmless. In
    short, if the jury were to reject the appellant’s primary position that he did
    not attend at the deceased’s house, then the evidence that the appellant and
    his co-accused were joint participants in a robbery, involving the use of
    considerable violence, was overwhelming. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Entry into the deceased’s house was gained by smashing
    down the front door. The house was turned upside down. The deceased was beaten
    about the head with a blunt instrument. The appellant, upon returning to the
    car, told Ms. Mathis that “<i>we</i><b> </b>turned him on his side. He was
    snoring” (emphasis added). It was also open to the jury, on Ms. Mathis’
    evidence, to conclude that the appellant took a blunt object from the trunk of

    trunk afterwards.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In sum, the evidence of robbery, violence and joint
    enterprise was overwhelming. The real issue for the jury was whether the
    appellant was at the murder scene. Once that issue was decided against him, the
    only other live issue for the jury was whether the appellant was guilty of
    murder or manslaughter. On that issue, to his good fortune, the jury chose to
    give the appellant the benefit of the doubt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, we would not give effect to this ground of
    appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Ground 5 – The jury’s verdict
    is unreasonable</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the outset of these reasons, we noted that the case
    for the Crown rested primarily, if not entirely, on Ms. Mathis’ testimony. We
    also explained that there were four items of evidence capable of supporting her
    testimony, with the fourth item – Ms.&nbsp;Pool’s evidence concerning the position
    of the deceased’s body – being particularly strong. It alone was capable of
    restoring the jury’s faith in Ms.&nbsp;Mathis’ evidence. Taking that into
    account, as well as the strong <i>Vetrovec</i> warning given by the trial judge and the appellant’s failure to testify, we are
    not persuaded that the verdict was unreasonable. (See <i>R. v. MacDonald</i>, [2008] 242 O.A.C. 244, at paras. 4-6).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, we would reject this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, the appeal from conviction is dismissed.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Sentence Appeal</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant has been deported. While his appeal
    against sentence was not abandoned, it was not pursued in oral argument. In any
    event, there is no merit in the sentence appeal. The sentence imposed was
    entirely fit and we see no basis for interfering with it. Accordingly, while
    leave to appeal sentence is granted, the appeal against sentence is dismissed.</p>

    confirming Ms. Mathis’ evidence were: (1) Security pictures from Cory Richard’s
    apartment depicting the appellant, Ms. Mathis and Mr. Burkoski together at one
    point; (2) Cory Richards and Tyrone Handsor both testified that Ms. Mathis, Mr.
    Burkoski and the appellant were in Cory Richard’s apartment on the night of the
    murder (and that the appellant received a telephone call and left); (3) if the
    jury accepted Dr. Ra’s evidence (that the murder weapon was a heavy metal
    object), it was capable of confirming Ms. Mathis’ testimony that she heard a
