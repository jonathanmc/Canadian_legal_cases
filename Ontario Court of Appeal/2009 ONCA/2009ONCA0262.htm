  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>I. <u>OVERVIEW</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, Ahmed Gelle, was convicted of robbery
    and of having his face masked with intent to commit an indictable offence
    following a seven day trial in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto
    in the Superior Court of Justice before Swinton J. and a jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals his conviction on a single
    ground, namely, that the trial judge erred in giving the jury an unsavoury
    witness warning with respect to testimony that favoured the defence.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>II. <u>FACTS</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Three men robbed a 7/11 convenience store in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto shortly after 3:00
    a.m. on a winter night in January 2003.  They stole money, cigarette cartons, bus tickets, and telephone cards.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There was very strong evidence that the appellant was
    one of the robbers.  The robbery was
    videotaped.  The witnesses who testified
    provided a continuous chain of evidence from the time of the robbery to the
    appellant’s arrest in a laneway next to the store almost immediately thereafter.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Daniel Abreha, one of the robbers, pleaded guilty at
    his own trial.  While in police custody,
    he gave a videotaped statement to police identifying the appellant as one of
    his accomplices in the robbery.  The
    statement was admitted as evidence at the appellant’s trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Abreha was also called as a Crown witness at the
    appellant’s trial.  His testimony,
    however, directly contradicted his prior statement to the police.  Whereas in his statement he identified the
    appellant as one of his accomplices, he testified at trial that the appellant
    was not one of the robbers.  Further, he
    did not identify the appellant in court and said that he had never seen the
    appellant before.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Abreha had a long criminal record, which included one conviction
    for armed robbery, three for robbery, eight for assault, and one for sexual
    assault.  His criminal record, coupled
    with the stark contrast between his statement to the police and his testimony
    in court, easily qualified him as an “unsavoury witness”.  Accordingly, in her charge to the jury, the
    trial judge gave a <i>Vetrovec<span
class=MsoFootnoteReference> </span> </i>warning
    in relation to Abreha.  This cautionary
    instruction forms the basis for the appellant’s sole ground of appeal to this
    court from his conviction of the two offences with which he was charged.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>III. <u>ISSUE</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sole issue on appeal is whether the trial judge
    erred in her decision to give a <i>Vetrovec </i>warning
    and/or in her articulation of the contents thereof.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>IV. <u>ANALYSIS</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In her charge to the jury in relation to Abreha’s
    evidence, the trial judge reminded the jury that they had heard evidence of
    Abreha’s significant criminal record.  She then gave the jury the following cautionary instruction:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Common sense tells
    you that there is good reason to look at Mr. Abreha’s evidence with the
    greatest of care and caution, given his background.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge continued and advised the jury that
    they could consider the fact, number, and nature of Abreha’s convictions in
    deciding how much of his testimony to believe and rely upon.  She reminded the jury, however, that a
    previous conviction, or even many of them, did not necessarily mean that the
    jury could not or should not believe or rely upon Abreha’s evidence.  The trial judge then instructed the jury as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If you were considering relying on Mr. Abreha’s
    evidence, you should look for evidence from somebody or something, other than
    Mr. Abreha, which tends to confirm Mr. Abreha’s evidence.  It is for you to say whether any evidence
    confirms or supports his testimony, and how that affects whether, or how much,
    you will believe of, or rely upon, his testimony in deciding the case.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>You may believe Mr. Abreha’s testimony if you find
    it trustworthy, even if no one or nothing else confirms it.  When you consider his testimony, however,
    keep in mind who gave the evidence and the circumstances under which Mr. Abreha
    testified.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant challenges the trial judge’s <i>Vetrovec</i> instructions to the jury in
    relation to Abreha’s evidence on two bases: first, that the trial judge erred in
    even giving a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning in
    relation to Abreha’s evidence; and, second, that the contents of the <i>Vetrovec</i> warning were deficient.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>1.         The trial judge did not err in giving a <i>Vetrovec </i>warning in relation to                             Abreha’s evidence.</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant submits that no <i>Vetrovec</i> warning should have been given by the trial judge in
    relation to Abreha’s evidence because, although Abreha was called as a Crown
    witness, his testimony at trial was exculpatory of the appellant; he was,
    therefore, in effect, a defence witness.  In support of this submission, the appellant relies on the decisions of
    this court in <i>R. v. Tzimopoulus</i> (1986), 29 C.C.C. (3d) 304, and <i>R. v.
    Chenier</i> (2006), 205 C.C.C. (3d) 333.  In <i>Chenier</i>, at pp. 352 – 353, Blair
    J.A. said the following with respect to giving a <i>Vetrovec </i>warning in relation to a defence witness:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is not permissible to give a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning in relation to a
    defence witness; the warning should only be given where a witness is giving
    evidence that assists in the demonstration of guilt.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>. . .</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The rationale behind the principle that a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning is not to be given in
    connection with defence evidence is that the instruction to look for
    confirmatory/corroborative evidence impermissibly transfers a burden to the
    accused and is contrary to the requirements of <i>W. (D.).</i>  Defence evidence
    need only raise a reasonable doubt. [Citations omitted.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For several reasons, I do not agree with the
    appellant’s submission in this regard.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, it is well established that whether or not to
    give a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning is a decision
    very much within the discretion of the trial judge: see <i>R. v. Bevan</i>, [1993] 2 S.C.R. 599, at p. 601.  In the same vein, in <i>R. v. Brooks</i>, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 237, at para. 24, Bastarache J. referred
    to “the spirit of <i>Vetrovec</i>, which
    affirmed a judicial discretion to provide warnings only in appropriate
    circumstances”, and then provided the following caution:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Provided there is a foundation for the judge’s
    exercise of discretion, appellate courts should not interfere.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the trial judge provided a draft of the jury
    charge to and consulted with counsel in relation thereto on the morning before
    delivering it.  During the pre-charge
    conference, defence counsel raised five concerns about the draft charge.  None related to the <i>Vetrovec</i> warning.  Nor did
    defence counsel object on this issue after the charge.  Although the absence of an objection is not
    conclusive, it is an important consideration in such a common and well-known
    area of criminal law: see <i>R. v. Harriott</i> (2002), 58 O.R. (3d) 1 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ),
    at para. 41, aff’d [2003)] 1 S.C.R. 39.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, and crucially, unlike the witnesses in <i>Tzimopoulus</i> and <i>Chenier</i>, Abreha was not a defence witness.  The reality is that his statement to the
    police was entirely inculpatory of the appellant, whereas his testimony at the
    trial was largely, although not exclusively, exculpatory.  In short, Abreha was a “mixed witness”.  For such a witness, the trial judge was not
    precluded from giving a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning if the trial judge, in the exercise of her discretion, “deemed it
    necessary”: see <i>Tzimopoulus</i> at p. 341.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, and bearing in mind both Abreha’s
    lengthy and serious criminal record as well as the inconsistencies between his
    statement to the police and his testimony at trial, I cannot say that the trial
    judge erred by exercising her discretion to give a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning to the jury in relation to Abreha.  Further, and perhaps more importantly, common
    sense dictates that a <i>Vetrovec </i>warning
    was entirely appropriate in this case – Abreha was indisputably a very
    unsavoury witness.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>1.         The contents of the trial judge’s <i>Vetrovec</i> warning were not deficient.</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s second argument is that if the trial
    judge did not err in giving a <i>Vetrovec </i>warning
    in relation to Abreha, the contents of the <i>Vetrovec</i> warning were deficient as the jury was not instructed that the warning applied
    equally to both Abreha’s prior statement and his trial testimony.  The appellant submits that the trial judge
    erred in emphasizing in her <i>Vetrovec </i>instruction
    the need for corroboration of Abreha’s trial evidence and in minimizing the
    need for corroboration of his statement.  He also submits that in her review of the evidence, the trial judge only
    reviewed independent evidence confirming Abreha’s statement, but not confirming
    his testimony.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For several reasons, I also do not agree with the
    appellant’s second submission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the content or form of a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning is, like the decision to give the warning, a
    matter in which the trial judge’s exercise of her discretion should generally
    be respected: see <i>Harriott</i> at para.
    32.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, defence counsel was informed about, accepted
    (pre-charge), and did not object (post-charge) to the contents of the <i>Vetrovec</i> warning.  As noted above, these are important factors which
    support the appropriateness and sufficiency of the trial judge’s instructions
    in this case: see <i>Harriott</i> at para.
    41.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, the warning delivered in this case was
    relatively soft or tame.  The trial
    judge’s instruction to the jury that “[c]ommon sense tells you that there is a
    good reason to look at Mr. Abreha’s evidence with the greatest of care and
    caution, given his background” does not easily attract the traditional <i>Vetrovec</i> label of a “clear and sharp
    warning”: see <i>R. v. Vetrovec</i>, [1982]
    1 S.C.R. 811, at p. 831.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth, the trial judge connected Abreha’s trial testimony
    and his prior statement to the police in an entirely appropriate fashion when she
    stated as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In deciding whether or how much to believe of, or
    rely upon, the testimony of Mr. Abreha at trial, you should consider his
    truthfulness and the weight you will give to his evidence in light of my
    earlier instructions about assessing the evidence of witnesses, and particularly
    a witness like Mr. Abreha.  You should
    also consider the fact, nature and extent of any differences that you find
    between what Mr. Abreha said here at trial and what he said in the earlier
    video statement in deciding how much or how little you will believe of, or rely
    upon, his testimony at trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fifth, the trial judge provided a comprehensive and
    unchallenged caution to the jury about the use they could make of Abreha’s
    prior inconsistent statement to the police that inculpated the appellant.  In this component of her charge, the trial
    judge properly conveyed to the jury a series of hurdles, relating both to the
    process by which the statement was obtained and to its substance, which the
    jury would have to clear before accepting it for the truth of its contents.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sixth, the trial judge specifically instructed the jury
    that nothing precluded them from believing Abreha’s testimony when he stated as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>You may believe Mr. Abreha’s testimony if you find
    it trustworthy, even if no one or nothing else confirms it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the purported unequal treatment by the trial
    judge of the independent evidence confirming Abreha’s statement to the police relative
    to the independent evidence confirming his testimony at the trial simply reflects
    the obvious reality in this case – there was a good deal of the former evidence
    and none of the latter.  In her closing
    address at trial, defence counsel (not appellate counsel) did not suggest any
    evidence that could be confirmatory of Abreha’s trial testimony.  Nor does appellate counsel point to such
    evidence.  It goes without saying that a
    trial judge cannot invent evidence in an attempt to create a more “equal”
    review of the evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, I would not give effect to the

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I have read the reasons for judgment of my colleague, MacPherson
    J.A.  I differ from my colleague’s
    reasons.  In my view the trial judge
    erred in giving a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning to
    the jury in respect of testimony that favoured the defence.  However, I agree with the result reached by
    my colleague as I would also dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I take a different view of the witness, Abreha, than my
    colleague.  In my view, Abreha was,
    without question, a defence witness at trial.  He recanted his KGB statement that was given to the police on his arrest
    and said, without qualification, that the appellant was not one of the
    robbers.  Thus at trial Abreha became a
    witness for the defence.  Based on <i>Tzimpoulos</i>, <i>supra,</i> and <i>Chenier</i>, <i>supra</i>, a <i>Vetrovec </i>warning was not called for.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When the trial judge advised the jury that they “should
    look for evidence from somebody or something other than Mr. Abreha, which tends
    to confirm Mr. Abreha’s evidence” she transferred the burden of proof to the
    appellant.  As noted by R.A. Blair J.A.
    in <i>Chenier</i> at p. 353 such an
    instruction is “contrary to the requirements of <i>W.(D.)</i>.”  The defence need do
    no more than raise a reasonable doubt.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge should at least have told the jury that
    they need not look for confirmatory evidence of Abreha’s trial evidence to
    raise a reasonable doubt.  <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nevertheless, I am satisfied that if the trial judge
    had not given a <i>Vetrovec</i> warning to
    the jury, there is no reasonable possibility that the verdict would have been
    different.  This was a very strong Crown
    case.  I would therefore invoke s.
    686(1)(b)(iii) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> as I conclude that no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice has occurred
    by reason of the erroneous instruction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the result, as indicated, I would dismiss the
    appeal.</p>
