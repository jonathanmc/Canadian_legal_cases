  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Paddock appeals from the terms of a divorce judgment that deal with property
    issues. He raises three main issues on appeal. First, he claims that the
    trial judge erred in finding that Mr. Paddock holds his shares in Cerro Stables
    Inc. and most of his interest in a shareholders’ loan to that company in
    trust for Mrs. Paddock. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not accept this submission. The trial judge’s findings that all of the
    consideration for the acquisition of these assets flowed from Mrs. Paddock
    was available on the evidence. Accordingly, the trial judge was correct in
    holding that the presumption of resulting trust applies and that the onus
    was on Mr. Paddock to demonstrate that a gift of the shares and shareholders’ loan
    was intended. See s. 14 of the <i>Family Law Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3,
    and <i>Pecore v. Pecore</i>, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 795. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    in our view, the trial judge made no error in declining to apply the parole
    evidence rule and in considering the whole of the evidence relating to the
    question of whether a gift was intended. As was noted by the trial judge,
    the presenting issue was the ownership of property and not simply the interpretation
    of a contract. Although the unanimous shareholders’
    agreement and other corporate records are relevant to determining the ownership
    of the property in question, they do not govern the ownership issue. This
    is particularly the case since the unanimous shareholders’ agreement post-dates
    the acquisition of the shares and since the presumption of resulting trust
    applies.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    considering the whole of the evidence, the trial judge determined that Mr.
    Paddock had not satisfied the onus of proof. The trial judge considered the
    relevant documents and records but found they were not conclusive for reasons
    she explained. In the end, the trial judge accepted Mrs. Paddock’s evidence
    that she did not intend to give up her inheritance. On the record before
    her, it was open to the trial judge to make these findings and we see no
    basis on which to interfere with them. Accordingly, we would not give effect
    to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second issue raised by Mr. Paddock is that the trial judge erred in holding
    that Mrs. Paddock was entitled to trace her inheritance into her shares in
    Cerro Stables Inc. and therefore to exclude a portion of her shareholdings
    from her net family property under s. 4(2) of the <i>Family Law Act</i>.
    We do not accept this submission. <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mrs.
    Paddock inherited a share of the businesses operated by her parents. The
    effect of the May 29, 1998 and December 31, 1998 transactions was to transfer
    the underlying assets of those businesses to Cerro Stables Inc. Those same
    assets formed the underlying value of the shares in Cerro Stables Inc. on
    the date of separation. Moreover, contrary to Mr. Paddock’s submissions,
    Mrs. Paddock paid for her shares in 1288891 Ontario Inc., which were converted
    into shares of Cerro Stables Inc., with the proceeds of her inheritance. <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    was noted by the trial judge, this case is distinguishable from <i>Rosenthal
    v. Rosenthal </i>(1986), 3 R.F.L. (3d) 126 (Ont. S.C.), and <i>Goodyer v.
    Goodyer </i>(1999), 168 D.L.R. (4th) 453 (Ont. S.C.), because Mrs. Paddock
    had received her inheritance when she subscribed for the shares in 1288891
    Ontario Inc. and because there was no separate loan that was later forgiven.
    Although the financial records of 1288891 Ontario Inc. reflected a receivable
    in relation to the share subscription for a period of time and the adjustment
    to the shareholders’ loan account was not made until later, these were merely
    the accounting entries through which Mrs. Paddock paid for the shares with
    the proceeds of her inheritance.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    effect of the May 29, 1998 transaction was to convert Mrs. Paddock’s inheritance
    to a different form consisting of both shares and a shareholders’ loan account
    in 1288891 Ontario Inc. These became interests in Cerro Stables Inc. by virtue
    of the amalgamation agreement. No issue was raised on this appeal concerning
    what portion of her shares Mrs. Paddock was entitled to exclude. In the circumstances,
    we see no error in the trial judge’s conclusion and we would not give effect
    to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    third issue raised by Mr. Paddock is that the trial judge erred in finding
    that Mrs. Paddock was entitled to trace her inheritance into her investment
    account.<i> </i>Mr. Paddock did not pursue this issue in oral argument. In
    our view, it was open to the trial judge to find as she did that Mrs. Paddock’s
    inheritance “did not lose its character simply because it was parked in the
    joint account for a period of four days.” We would not give effect to this
    ground of appeal.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the appeal is dismissed with costs to the respondent fixed in the amount
    of $10,000 inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
