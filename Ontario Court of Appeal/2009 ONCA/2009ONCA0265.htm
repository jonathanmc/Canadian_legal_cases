  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Rosenberg J.A.:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      Dr.
    Paul Sharkey appeals from the judgment of Tucker J. finding him negligent
    in the care and treatment of his patient Cheryl MacKinnon. The appellant
    submits that the trial judge erred in finding that MacKinnon did not provide
    her informed consent to surgery, erred in finding that the appellant breached
    the standard of care of the surgery, and erred in finding that any breach
    of the standard of care caused the damages MacKinnon suffered. The appellant
    further submits that the trial judge erred in her application of the law
    and made palpable and overriding errors of fact.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      In
    my view, the trial judge properly applied the law with respect to informed
    consent and made no palpable and overriding factual errors in this respect.
    In the result, it becomes unnecessary to consider the various other issues
    raised by the appellant concerning the standard of care as it related to
    the surgery itself and causation. For the following reasons, I would dismiss
    the appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Introduction</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    respondent Cheryl MacKinnon is a single mother of three children. In 1989,
    she began to develop pain in the fingers of her left hand. The pain gradually
    spread to the hand, arm and shoulder. She was able to work all day long and
    it was only at night that the symptoms would develop, sometimes preventing
    her from sleeping. She spoke to several physicians in an attempt to identify
    the cause of the symptoms and she was provided with a number of non-invasive
    treatments with drugs and physiotherapy. These treatments provided little,
    if any, relief. The initial diagnosis had been Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. However,
    by July 2000, a specialist to whom the appellant had been referred thought
    the symptoms were a result of Thoracic Outlet Syndrome. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      Thoracic
    Outlet Syndrome is a description of a variety of symptoms caused by compression
    of the vessels and nerves between the clavicle and the first rib. Thoracic
    Outlet Syndrome surgery is designed to relieve the pressure by removing the
    first rib. This is major surgery. The surgeon is working in a confined space
    in the vicinity of both a major artery, the subclavian artery from the aorta
    to the left arm, and an important nerve, the brachial plexus.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      In
    late 2001, MacKinnon’s family physician referred her to the appellant for
    a surgical consultation. The appellant is a general surgeon in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Kitchener with privileges at
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Grand River
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Hospital. The appellant saw MacKinnon on January 31 and March 19, 2002. The
    surgery was performed on March 22, 2002. In the course of the surgery the
    subclavian artery and vein and the brachial plexus were injured. It became
    necessary to transfer the respondent by helicopter to a tertiary care hospital.
    When she arrived at the hospital the respondent was “<i>in extremis</i>”;
    there was heavy bleeding into the chest cavity and the physicians had difficulty
    obtaining a blood pressure reading. The consequences of the injuries to the
    artery, vein and especially the brachial plexus, were disastrous, leaving
    MacKinnon with permanent disabilities and chronic pain. In view of my conclusion
    concerning informed consent it is unnecessary to detail the course of the
    operation and post-operative care.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The March 19 consultation</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    March 19 visit lies at the heart of the trial judge’s finding that the respondent’s
    consent to the surgery was not informed. The appellant and MacKinnon gave
    conflicting versions of what was discussed at the March 19 consult. While
    the trial judge accepted the respondent’s version of the events, since the
    appellant submits that she made palpable and overriding errors in doing so,
    I will summarize the testimony of both parties.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    appellant testified that he advised MacKinnon of the risk of damage to the
    subclavian artery and vein, damage to the brachial plexus nerve and of pneumonia.
    He testified that he “would have” shown her pictures of the vessels and nerves
    and of the incision as well as an artist’s rendition of the removal of the
    first rib. He said that he would have told her “that they  are in a very
    tight space, that they [the blood vessels] are held out of the way or retracted
    during the procedure, that they are guarded and protected or at least when
    I do them they are guarded and protected”. He testified that he does not “get
    real specific” but tells the patient: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If you put a hole into somebody’s subclavian or
    axillary artery, there is a significant amount of bleeding. The good news
    is it’s usually right there, right in front of your visual field and it’s
    a matter of putting a stitch or two in it to repair it. The brachial plexus
    is a different matter. These are the nerves to the hand and arm. As a result
    you can lose function of certain muscle groups, have a dysfunctional hand
    basically. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    appellant testified that he had that sort of discussion with the respondent
    on March 19. He testified that he would have told the respondent she would
    be in hospital between four and eight days, depending on pain management.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    appellant also made notes of the discussion. His handwritten notes of March
    19 are as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=PT-BR>Risks, A/V/N damage, pneumonia
      etc</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Expectation of length of stay etc</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    also dictated a note on March 20 as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Using textbooks and diagrams, I have gone over
    the surgery and what it entails, a detailed discussion about the risks including
    trauma to the subclavian artery, vein or brachial plexus, and what the sequelae
    of that trauma could entail. Postop. expectations etc. were all discussed
    with her. It is really her feeling that the symptomatology has got so bad
    that she really does not have anything left to choose but to proceed with
    surgical resection of her first rib.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for the respondent read in a portion of the appellant’s examination for discovery
    in which the appellant said that he told MacKinnon she would be in hospital
    for a couple of days and off work for six to eight weeks. In his examination
    for discovery he recalled saying something along the lines that “you don’t
    want me to do anything to the arteries this would result in bleeding a lot”.
    However, he denied saying, “it’s not like I will be getting drunk that night
    [before the surgery]”. At trial, he merely testified that he could not remember
    making a comment about getting drunk. During the examination for discovery,
    the appellant did not recall whether the respondent had asked any questions
    concerning permanent damage. At trial, he testified that she did ask questions
    about arteries, veins, nerves and the likelihood of trauma. At the examination
    for discovery, he testified that he did not specifically talk to the respondent
    about repairing the artery. As indicated above, at trial he testified that
    he did discuss repairing the artery.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>MacKinnon
    testified that she had only a brief, 15 minute discussion with the appellant
    on March 19. The appellant did not discuss the possibility of nerve damage
    from the operation or damage to the veins and artery or the possibility of
    heart failure. He said the surgery would take 30 to 45 minutes and she would
    be in and out of hospital in 3 to 4 hours. This was consistent with the hospital
    booking sheet, which indicated the length of stay as “a.m.”. The appellant
    told her that she would be fine. She gave this account of the conversation
    about the risks from the surgery:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>He started telling me what was going to happen.
    He turned around in his chair. He grabbed a book. He put it down in front
    of us. He turned to a page and he said that … he showed me your vein that
    my nerves were tucked in and that kind of thing and then he … he said didn’t
    want me to touch the … to touch these and I said why, what happens. <i>And
    he said you’d bleed a lot. And I said, oh. And he said, it’s not like I’m
    going to be out drinking the night before, eh, Cheryl. </i>[Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
    of the remark about not drinking the night before, the appellant seemed to
    be making light of the risks. MacKinnon denied that there was any detailed
    discussion of the risks including trauma to the artery, vein or nerve and
    what the result of the trauma could be. All the appellant said was that she
    could bleed a lot.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>MacKinnon
    agreed that she felt that she had no other option than surgery to deal with
    the pain. However, she also testified that had she known the risk of heart
    failure or the consequences of a cut to an artery she would not have undergone
    the surgery. She explained that she was the single mother of three children
    and would never have taken the risk.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE TRIAL JUDGE’S REASONS ON
      INFORMED CONSENT</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge stated that the test for informed consent is “whether on the
    balance of probabilities a reasonable person in the position of the plaintiff
    would have consented to the surgery if appropriate and proper disclosure
    of the risks were provided to her”. The trial judge also referred to the
    test for causation, holding that if a reasonable person, properly informed
    of the risks, would have consented to the surgery, causation was not made
    out. The trial judge then excerpted a portion of the reasons of the court
    in <i>Arndt v. Smith</i>, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 539 at para. 15, concerning the
    appropriate test to be applied.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge accepted the respondent’s version of the March 19 meeting. The
    important part of the trial judge’s findings of fact are as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Firstly, I accept Cheryl MacKinnon's description
    of the 15-minute discussion of the operation with Dr. Sharkey. Dr. Sharkey
    had no independent recollection of the conversation nor did he have specific
    notes. His description of the risks appears to the court to be a &quot;rote&quot; one.
    His description at trial of what he would have said to Cheryl MacKinnon was
    based on what he called his usual practices. He would have had hundreds,
    if not thousands, of such conversations over the years and would not likely
    have had any specific recollection of his talk with Cheryl McKinnon.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>For many reasons, Ms. MacKinnon was in a much better
    position to recall the conversation and to report Dr. Sharkey's attitude
    towards the surgery. Unlike Dr. Sharkey, this would have been the only such
    conversation she had probably ever had in her life and, given the serious
    consequences that occurred to her, her recollection on what had been told
    to her would be acute. In other words, she had reasons to recall what she
    had been told in the light of what happened to her. I recognize that Cheryl
    MacKinnon's memory as to dates and times and some specific details were not
    the best due to her heavy narcotics use. However, she was very specific about
    the conversation she had with Dr. Sharkey. Accordingly, I accept her testimony
    in that regard.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Specifically
    as to the disclosure made by the appellant, the trial judge found as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>According to Cheryl's recollection, there was no
    discussion of nerve damage, vein damage, or other consequences at all in
    any detail. Even if a general discussion was held as described by Dr. Sharkey
    covering some areas of concern, I would not find it adequate unless the grave
    circumstances were clearly outlined and the very extreme possible outcomes
    were made clear to her. The impression left with Cheryl MacKinnon after Dr.
    Sharkey's description of the surgery was, given his attitude which she felt
    was, for want of a better word, flip, and thus her belief was that the surgery
    would not have serious risks. In addition, her belief that it was a day surgery
    all leads me to find that inadequate disclosure was made. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    to causation, the trial judge found that the respondent was not desperate
    for a solution and that surgery was her only choice. She accepted MacKinnon’s
    evidence that the difficulty with her arm was not interfering with her social
    or work life. She accepted the evidence of MacKinnon’s family physician that
    the respondent was referred to the appellant for the purposes of obtaining
    an opinion as to the surgical options available to treat her problem. The
    trial judge found that the surgery was “optional and elective”
    and  concluded on causation as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In the circumstances of Cheryl MacKinnon's life
    at the time, with two children to support, I find she would not as a reasonable
    person have consented to what was elective surgery had she known the consequences
    by being properly informed about it.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    did not understand the appellant to suggest that the trial judge applied
    the wrong legal test. She referred to <i>Arndt v. Smith</i>, which in turn
    refers to the leading authority of <i>Reibl v. Hughes</i>, [1980] 2 S.C.R.
    880. Subject to what I say below, I also did not understand there to be any
    dispute about the appropriate standard of disclosure. In his own testimony,
    the appellant accepted that the standard of care was to tell patients the
    potential risks of the operation. Thus, he accepted that he would have to
    tell the respondent that the surgery takes place in a “very tight space”,
    that there are “big vessels”
    in the area that have to be protected or guarded. He would also have to tell
    the patient about the risk of bleeding and that while the artery is “usually
    right there” and easily repaired, the brachial plexus “is a different matter”.
    Since the brachial plexus supplies nerves to the hand and arm there was a
    risk of losing function of the hand. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    experts called by the appellant and the respondent agreed that had the appellant
    provided the information as summarized in his note of March 20 he would have
    met the applicable standard of care. One of the appellant’s experts suggested
    that the appellant exceeded the standard of care by showing her diagrams.
    This same expert also agreed that it was important to tell patients about
    potential consequences because the surgery carries serious risks and there
    should be a detailed discussion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    the principal issues of disclosure and informed consent in this appeal are
    purely factual questions. The standard of review is a strict one. As this
    court said in <i>Hill v. Allen</i>, 2009 ONCA 70 at para. 36, a trial judge’s
    findings as to the acts or omissions that constitute negligence attract considerable
    deference: “absent palpable and overriding error, there is no room for appellate
    interference with those findings.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dealing
    first with the trial judge’s findings on disclosure of risks, the appellant
    identifies the palpable and overriding error as the trial judge’s failure
    to take into account the appellant’s contemporaneous notes made on March
    19 and 20. The appellant submits that the trial judge provided no rationale
    for why those notes should be disbelieved or discounted. Further, the trial
    judge failed to take into account the appellant’s testimony of his usual
    practice, which was circumstantial evidence that the discussion actually
    took place.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the trial judge did not make any palpable and overriding error.
    There is no onus on a trial judge to refer to every piece of evidence adduced
    by the parties. The trial judge must have been aware that the appellant had
    made notes of the conversation, since in her review of the appellant’s evidence
    earlier in her reasons she pointed out that certain matters were not documented
    in those notes. For example, the appellant’s notes of the first visit do
    not document the tests he says he performed, while the notes of the second
    visit do not document the expected length of stay in the hospital. The trial
    judge accurately and fully recounted the appellant’s testimony as to his
    version of the March 19 conversation. </p>

    trial judge was not bound to accept the appellant’s version of events simply
    because he had made notes. The trial judge explained why she accepted MacKinnon’s
    evidence. There was a basis for doing so. As she pointed out, the appellant
    had little memory of the actual conversation and was relying essentially
    on what he would have said. By contrast, MacKinnon had quite a vivid memory
    of the conversation, especially the comment about not being out drinking
    the night before the surgery. Significantly, at trial the appellant did not
    deny making the comment, he simply testified that he did not remember saying
    it. The appellant was also inconsistent as between his examination for discovery
    and his trial evidence as to whether he discussed the consequences associated
    with the risks of the surgery.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also submits that the trial judge erred in her findings with respect
    to causation. Again as pointed out in <i>Hill</i> at para. 37, the standard
    for appellate intervention is an exacting one and the appellant must establish
    palpable and overriding error. The appellant submits that the trial judge
    erred in finding that the patient was not desperate for a solution and that
    surgery was her only choice. The appellant submits that the trial judge failed
    to take into account evidence of complaints that MacKinnon made as recorded
    in notes of other specialists she saw before seeing the appellant. However,
    MacKinnon disagreed with the contents of those notes and it was open to the
    trial judge to accept her evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge failed to consider MacKinnon’s testimony
    that she felt she had no other option but to proceed with the surgery given
    her situation. However, this is a narrow reading of her testimony. She made
    that statement in the context of being unaware of the risks of the surgery.
    It was open to the trial judge to infer that had she been properly informed
    of the risks and the consequences, she would not have elected to have the
    surgery. As she said, “I consented to the surgery on the grounds of what
    he … of how he told me.”  The evidence of the respondent, accepted by the
    trial judge, was that the appellant made light of the risks and did not tell
    her of the potential consequences.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge erred in concluding that if the disclosure
    described by the appellant had been made it was still inadequate. This submission
    is based on the following passage of the reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Although all three medical experts opined that
    if Dr. Sharkey had the conversation as he said he did, it would meet the
    standard of adequate disclosure, these opinions are based on the assumption
    such disclosure was made and that it was done in such a way that it was understood
    by the patient and in a way that she could properly make and assess the material
    risks to make a determination on that basis as to whether to have the surgery
    or not.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not read this passage as imposing a higher standard of care than was testified
    to by the appellant and the experts. Rather, the trial judge found that the
    appellant did not in fact make the disclosure that he said he did and which
    he agreed needed to be made to meet the standard of care.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that MacKinnon’s evidence that she would not have proceeded
    with the surgery had she been properly informed of the risks is “inherently
    unreliable as she was no doubt influenced by the hindsight knowledge of the
    adverse outcome”. However, the trial judge was well aware that the test to
    be applied is a modified objective one that protects against the dangers
    of a purely subjective test. As the Court said in <i>Arndt v. Smith </i>at
    para. 16:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A purely subjective test could serve as an incitement
    for a disappointed patient to bring an action. The plaintiff will invariably
    state with all the confidence of hindsight and with all the enthusiasm of
    one contemplating an award of damages that consent would never have been
    given if the disclosure required by an idiosyncratic belief had been made.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that the respondent “would not as a reasonable person” have
    consented to the surgery had she been properly informed of the consequences.
    The trial judge having heard all the evidence was in the best position to
    infer whether a reasonable person in the respondent’s position would have
    consented to the surgery. I see no basis for interfering with that conclusion.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>DISPOSITION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I would dismiss the appeal with costs fixed at $40,000 inclusive of G.S.T.
    and disbursements.</p>
