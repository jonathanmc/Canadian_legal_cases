  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>I.          OVERVIEW</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    March 15, 1986, Jane Chalmers was found dead in a ditch along a rural side
    road near
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Sarnia,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario.  Her horse was found running loose nearby, and the police concluded
    that her death was the result of a riding accident.  The appellant, her husband,
    was not a suspect at the time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fifteen
    years later, in 2001, the original investigating officer came across photos
    of Ms. Chalmers’ dead body when he was cleaning out his desk.  The photos
    piqued the curiosity of one of his colleagues (a rider himself) and, after
    re-examining them again, the police became sceptical about the accident theory
    and re-opened the case as a homicide investigation.  In the course of the
    investigation, they persuaded the appellant to attend at the police station
    voluntarily to submit to a polygraph test.  While being interviewed at length
    around the taking of that test – in circumstances that I shall explore – the
    appellant ultimately confessed to the killing.  He wrote a letter of apology
    to his former wife’s mother, and he agreed to, and did, attend at the site
    of the death to conduct a re-enactment of the event with the police.  A year
    later, the appellant recanted his statements and disavowed the re-enactment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    November 13, 2003, a jury found the appellant guilty of the second degree
    murder of Ms. Chalmers.  The trial judge subsequently sentenced him to life
    imprisonment without eligibility for parole for 14 years.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant now attacks both his conviction and sentence.   </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>II.        ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    he raised a number of arguments in his factum, the appellant’s principal
    oral submissions regarding conviction were three-fold.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    he says that his various out-of-court statements were inadmissible because
    they were taken in violation of his rights under s. 10(b) of the <i>Canadian
    Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>.  In this regard, the appellant concedes
    he was properly and repeatedly advised of his <i>Charter</i> rights on several
    occasions during the part of the polygraph interview preceding the point
    where he first admits to hitting his wife when she got off her horse.  He
    contends that he was detained and that his jeopardy changed significantly
    at that point, however, and that the police were therefore required to re-administer
    his s. 10(b) rights in full immediately after that admission.  Because they
    failed to do so, the appellant submits that his statements should have been
    excluded pursuant to s. 24(2).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the appellant argues that the trial judge erred in refusing to leave the
    issue of intent and the potential verdict of manslaughter with the jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    the appellant seeks leave to introduce as fresh evidence a report prepared
    by Dr. Laurence Holt, a professor emeritus in kinesiology at
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Dalhousie
    <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">
    University.  This proposed evidence bears on the issue of whether Jane Chalmers
    might have died in a horse riding accident – as the original investigation
    had concluded – rather than as a result of foul play.  Dr. Holt presents
    an alternative construction of the evidence centred on the possibility of
    Ms. Chalmers’ horse having made a rapid pivoting turn causing her to fall
    off, catch her foot in the stirrup, and be swung around in an arc, striking
    her head multiple times on the ground before sliding into the ditch.  Although
    the issue of death by riding accident was central at trial, this particular
    construction of the evidence was not addressed by any expert or put to the
    jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    with respect to sentence, the appellant submits that the period of parole
    ineligibility imposed should be reduced from 14 to 12 years.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the conviction appeal and grant
    leave to appeal sentence but dismiss the sentence appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>III.       THE CONFESSIONS
      AND ALLEGED VIOLATION OF THE CHARTER</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the trial judge was fully justified in concluding that the appellant’s
    s.&nbsp;10(b) <i>Charter</i> rights were not infringed during the polygraph
    examination and subsequent interrogation.  In order to explain my conclusion,
    it is necessary to review the circumstances of the confession in some detail.</p>
  <h3>(1)       Circumstances Surrounding the Confessions</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    June, 2001, DC Peter Baker (the curious colleague of the original investigator)
    and DC Joe Devolder had the investigation formally re-opened as a homicide,
    with Devolder as the lead investigator.  They interviewed officers involved
    in the 1986 investigation, the coroner who had found the death to be a riding
    accident and various neighbours and friends of the Chalmers.  They took additional
    photos of the crime scene and sought expert opinions.  One expert, Dr. Brooks,
    thought the new and old photographs indicated that the death could have been
    caused by a horse.  However, the other expert, Dr. Chiasson, considered that
    possibility “unlikely”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    investigators persisted.  In August, 2001, two neighbours and friends, Don
    Moore and Dennis Spitzig, submitted to polygraph tests.  Mr. Moore was a
    horseman and former high school friend of Jane Chalmers.  When questioned
    by police, he admitted that he had been having an affair with Jane shortly
    before she died.  Mr. Spitzig owned the farm where Ms. Chalmers stabled her
    horse, and he was with the appellant when they found her body by the side
    of the road in the ditch.</p>
  <h3 style='page-break-after:avoid'><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>The
        October 3, 2001 Interview</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    September, 2001, Devolder and Det. Staff Sgt. David Quigley, of the OPP Criminal
    Behaviour Analysis Services, decided to interview the appellant.  On October
    3<sup>rd</sup>, Quigley called the appellant and asked if he would attend
    at the police station to discuss an on-going investigation.  When he arrived
    at the station, Quigley told the appellant the police had “received some
    information … suggesting that [Jane Chalmers’] death might not have been
    an accident.”  The appellant denied any involvement and gave an exculpatory
    statement.  Knowing that the police had no such information, Quigley then
    asked why someone would say they had seen the appellant’s car on
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Waterworks Road, where the body was found, the morning of the death.  The
    appellant conceded that he could have travelled down that road to check whether
    the Spitzigs were home, but did not recall doing so.  Quigley told the appellant
    the police were aware of some affairs that he and his wife had been having
    back then.  The appellant denied ever having been unfaithful to Jane and
    said that no one had ever suggested to him that she had been having an affair.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    police had no evidence at the time that the appellant’s car had been seen
    on Waterworks Road at the time and, while Don Moore had admitted his affair
    with Jane Chalmers to them, the police had no evidence the appellant was
    having an affair.  The interview ended with Quigley asking the appellant
    to submit to a polygraph test in order to help the investigation along.  Devolder
    later called the appellant and arranged for the test to take place on October
    5, 2001.</p>
  <h3 style='page-break-after:avoid'><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>The
        October 5, 2001 Polygraph Interview and Subsequent Inculpatory Statements</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    the appellant voluntarily arrived at the police station on October 5<sup>th </sup>and
    the interview began at 12:31 P.M., the police had no conclusive evidence
    that Jane Chalmers’ death was a homicide, and no direct evidence implicating
    her husband in her death.  When he left five-and-a-half hours later, they
    had an oral confession confirmed by a letter of apology written by the appellant
    to the deceased’s mother, and they were on their way to the scene of the
    death where the appellant would walk them through a re-enactment of what
    he then recalled had happened.  The investigation had advanced considerably.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    October 6<sup>th</sup>, the appellant made further admissions about the offence
    to two relatives who came to visit him at the police station, as well as
    further admissions to DC Devolder during a twenty-five minute discussion
    with him that day.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Det.
    Sgt. Edward Murray conducted the interview and polygraph test on October
    5<sup>th</sup>, following a briefing by Quigley and Devolder. 
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Murray’s manner was courteous and solicitous throughout the lengthy process.  In
    his ruling on the statement <i>voir dire</i>, the trial judge noted that
    Murray’s communication style was gentle and sensitive, and found him to be “persistently
    persuasive, but not … aggressive.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    interview can be divided into three general phases.  In the first phase (leading
    up to and including the administration of the polygraph test) the appellant
    was advised of his rights, the polygraph process was explained to him, and
    there was some general discussion about the events surrounding Ms. Chalmers’ death
    in which the appellant maintained his denial of any involvement.  In the
    second phase (following the polygraph test) Det. Sgt. Murray changed the
    tone and abruptly challenged the appellant by indicating there was no doubt
    in his mind that the appellant caused his wife’s death.  He immediately reminded
    the appellant of his rights before embarking on a lengthy monologue.  During
    that monologue, Murray suggested that the appellant had been wronged by his
    wife, was upset because of that, and met Ms. Chalmers on the road to talk
    things through, but things just got out of hand – a less serious scenario
    than deliberate murder.  Ultimately,
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Murray extracted an admission from the appellant.  Finally (in the denouement)
    the confession was fleshed out, the appellant confirmed the confession in
    writing in the form of a letter of apology to Ms. Chalmers’ mother, and agreed
    to attend at the scene of the murder for a re-enactment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the outset of the polygraph interview, the appellant was advised that he
    was not then being detained, that the door was unlocked and he was free to
    leave any time he wished, and that he could stop the interview process at
    any time if he wished to do so.  He acknowledged his understanding of this.  He
    was told by Murray that under the <i>Charter</i> he had the right to consult
    a lawyer, that the police had the names and phone numbers of legal aid lawyers
    and duty counsel, and that if at any time during the interview he wanted
    to speak to a lawyer “just let me know and I’ll … I’ll get a telephone for
    you and you can make a phone call in private.”  This was “an open offer.”  The
    appellant at no time prior to his admission indicated he wished to call a
    lawyer.  When asked by
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Murray if he wanted to do so, the appellant replied “No, just you … Hopefully,
    this will clear it and we’ll move on”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was also advised of his right to remain silent.  In relation to
    the polygraph test, he was told that
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Murray’s opinion based on the results of the test was not admissible in court
    but that the contents of any conversations between the two of them may be.  The
    appellant indicated his understanding of all of this advice.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Murray reviewed the Provincial Police Polygraph Examination Consent form
    with the appellant, while the appellant followed along, nodding his head.  Having
    read the form and later initialled his understanding of each of the foregoing
    rights before signing the form, the appellant had specifically been made
    aware of the toll-free 1-800 number that he could use to access free legal
    advice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    was made clear to the appellant almost from the outset of questioning that
    he was a suspect in a homicide case.  He was asked repeatedly – nine times
    during the test alone – whether he had done anything physical to cause his
    wife’s death.  By the trial judge’s count, there had been 27 references to
    the appellant’s potential jeopardy by the time the polygraph test had been
    administered.  </p>

    considering the s. 10(b) argument, the trial judge made the following factual
    findings:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is clear from that form [i.e., the Provincial
    Police Polygraph Examination Consent] and from the reading that the officer
    and the accused went through in connection with it that Mr. Chalmers understood
    he didn’t have to speak, he understood he didn’t have to stay, he understood
    that his jeopardy was with respect to the offence of homicide.  He understood
    that the officer’s opinion with respect to the polygraph would not be admissible
    in court whereas the conversation between the two of them would.  He received
    a secondary warning with respect to the right to silence and again he understood
    that his conversation with the officer would be admissible, but that the
    officer’s opinion on the polygraph examination would not be admissible.  He
    understood he had the option to stop the proceedings, he understood that
    the test was voluntary.  By my enumeration by the end of this procedure the
    offence of homicide has been referred to at least three times.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>With respect to his s. 10 rights by the end of
    this procedure Mr. Chalmers has been advised for a fourth time that he has
    the right to contact a lawyer and through reading of the form and in initialling
    it later he has been advised twice specifically about the 1-800 phone number.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is clear that he voluntarily agrees to take
    the test.  It is clear that he understands he can stop it at any time.  It
    is clear that he understands his right to silence and understands that anything
    he says may be given in evidence in court.  It is clear that he understands
    everything is being recorded on video.  It is clear that he understands that
    if he admits or confesses to the offence of homicide he will be arrested
    and charged.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge concluded that the appellant’s statements were voluntary and
    that they had not been obtained in violation of his <i>Charter</i> rights.  He
    reviewed the legal requirements of s. 10(b) at length, and concluded that
    the appellant “clearly understood all of his rights through the continuum
    from the point when Murray elaborately explained them to the point when he
    expressed … a desire to exercise his right to call a lawyer” in relation
    to seeking bail, after the initial confessions and letter, after he was placed
    under arrest, and after he had agreed to participate in the re-enactment.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    findings were based on the trial judge’s assessment of the testimony given
    on the <i>voir dire</i> by the appellant, the police officers involved, and
    other witnesses, and on the trial judge’s careful review and analysis of
    the video of the entire interview and polygraph process.  Having watched
    the video, the trial judge was in an excellent position to gauge the appellant’s
    demeanour and reactions during the interrogation and to draw inferences – which
    he did – about the nature and extent of the appellant’s understanding and
    volition during the process.  </p>
  <h3>(3)       Arguments on Appeal</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that the trial judge erred in concluding that his s. 10(b) <i>Charter </i>rights
    had not been infringed.  Mr. Campbell acknowledged, as the trial judge found,
    that the appellant was “detained” at the point in the interview immediately
    following his admission that he started to hit Ms. Chalmers when she got
    off her horse.  This was at 4:24 p.m., about 3 hours and 53 minutes into
    the interview.  The argument is that the police were required to re-advise
    the appellant of his s. 10(b) rights to counsel immediately after his first
    admission, which they failed to do.  Consequently, the appellant submits,
    all of his subsequent statements to the police, and to others, and all of
    the information the police obtained through the re-enactment at the site,
    should have been excluded from the evidence at trial pursuant to s. 24(2)
    of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    rationale behind this submission is that the appellant had, at this point,
    finally been detained, his jeopardy had changed significantly since the police
    then had grounds to arrest him for a homicide offence, and considerable time
    had passed since the appellant had been given a proper s. 10(b) caution at
    the outset of the polygraph interview: see <i>R. v. Bartle</i>, [1994] 3
    S.C.R. 173; <i>R. v. Black</i>, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 138; <i>R. v. Schmautz</i>,
    [1990] 1 S.C.R. 398; <i>R. v. McIntosh</i> (1999), 141 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ); <i>R. v. Amyot</i>, [1991] R.J.Q. 954 (

    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ); <i>R. v. Paternak</i>, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 607, rev’g (1995), 174 A.R. 129
    (C.A.).  In such circumstances, there must be a reasonably close temporal
    link between the detention and the s. 10(b) caution, argues the appellant.  It
    did not exist in this case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    response, the Crown submits that the trial judge applied the correct legal
    principles, and there was no error in his conclusion
    – the police properly advised the appellant of his s. 10(b) rights early
    in the interview, and the appellant was well-aware of all of those rights
    when he was detained following his first confession.  There was a sufficiently
    close temporal and factual link.</p>
  <h3>(4)       Analysis: Failure to Establish a s. 10(b) Violation</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    too have reviewed the key parts of the video of the polygraph interview.  In
    my view, the trial judge’s findings were amply grounded in the evidence.  The
    trial judge was alert to the requirements set out in the jurisprudence and
    his conclusion that there was a sufficient factual connection between the
    detention and the s. 10(b) caution was fully justified.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Schmautz</i>,
    the Supreme Court of Canada made it clear that an anticipatory pre-detention
    caution is not precluded where there is a close factual connection or linkage
    relating the warning to the detention and the reason for the detention.  Mr.
    Schmautz was charged and convicted of refusing to comply with a breathalyser
    demand in the following circumstances.  The police initially attended at
    his home in the course of investigating a hit-and-run accident.  He invited
    them in.  The officers advised him of the reason for their investigation
    and then of his right to remain silent and of his right to counsel.  Subsequently,
    while questioning Mr. Schmautz, the officers formed the view that he was
    impaired and demanded that he submit to a breathalyzer test.  He refused
    to comply and ushered them from his home.  Ten minutes had elapsed between
    the reading of the warnings and the subsequent breathalyzer demand.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Schmautz argued that the earlier warning was not sufficient under s. 10 because
    he was neither detained nor in any legal jeopardy at that time.  In order
    to comply with s. 10, he argued that a fresh warning should have been given
    at the moment the detention commenced.  In dissent, Lamer J. accepted this
    argument.  However, the majority did not.  Speaking for the majority (Dickson
    C.J.C., Gonthier, La Forest, Sopinka, Cory and McLachlin JJ.), Gonthier J.
    engaged in the following analysis (at pp. 415-416):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Quite obviously, a <i>Charter</i> warning cannot
    amount to sufficient compliance no matter when and in what circumstances
    it is read.  It must satisfy the purpose of s. 10, that is, the detainee
    must be made aware of the right to counsel and be permitted to retain and
    instruct counsel without delay with respect to his detention and the reasons
    therefor.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>In this respect, the fact that the advice is
      given before detention is not determinative</i>. <i>… It cannot be that
      a warning falls short of being sufficient compliance with s. 10(b) of the
      Charter for the sole reason that it is given before the exact moment in
      time when detention commences</i>.  The concept of detention has evolved
      since the <i>Charter</i> came into force and it is not always easy to determine
      in given circumstances whether and when it legally occurs.  From the mere
      investigation to which a person wilfully collaborates to the custodial
      arrest of that person, there is a wide spectrum encompassing the varying
      degrees of legal jeopardies in which the state can put individuals; in
      some cases, the precise moment when detention arises is by no means easy
      to ascertain.  Keeping that in mind, it is understandable that police officers
      sometimes lean towards greater caution to make sure that a person is aware
      of his or her rights at any relevant time and give the warning when investigation
      commences or during its course.  <i>Finding a Charter violation upon the
      sole fact that the warning was read before detention arose would be demonstrative
      of a legalistic and technical approach having little regard to the purpose
      of s. 10(b), as reflected by its very wording.</i>  It provides in its
      English version that “[e]veryone has the right <u>on</u> arrest or detention” (emphasis
      added) to retain and instruct counsel without delay and to be informed
      thereof.  <span lang=FR-CA>The French version reads: “[c]hacun a le droit, <u>en
      cas</u> d’arrestation ou de détention”&nbsp;(emphasis added).  </span><i>If
      one reads the two versions together it becomes clear that s. 10(b) refers
      to a factual connection between the detention and the right to a warning
      rather than a mere coincidence in time</i>.  It is true that the temporal
      aspect becomes vital at one point because the warning must be given “without
      delay”.  <i>If the warning is given before detention, however, the only
      requirement is a close factual connection relating the warning to the detention
      and the reasons therefore.  The existence of the required link will depend
      on the facts of each case.</i> [Italics added; citations omitted.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,
    as noted, the trial judge conducted a full and careful review of the evidence <u>and</u> the
    videotaped interview.  He was alive to the <i>Schmautz</i> test, citing it
    at length, and concluding that “there was a close factual connection between
    the earlier elaborate explanation of [the appellant’s] s. 10(b) rights,” and
    the detention, and that there had been a
    “clear waiver” of those rights throughout.  These conclusions were supported
    on the record.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was told and understood at all times that he was being questioned
    as a suspect and that his jeopardy was with respect to an offence of homicide – he
    was asked repeatedly whether he had done anything to cause his wife’s death.  Thus,
    his status was as a murder suspect, and the nature of his jeopardy did not
    change after his first admission.  There was nothing coercive or oppressive
    in the approach taken by Det. Sgt.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Murray or in the techniques he employed.  The appellant was fully advised
    of his rights, including his s. 10(b) right to counsel, at the outset of
    the interview.  He freely waived those rights.  Roughly three hours and twenty
    minutes later – after the appellant had submitted to the polygraph test and
    after Det. Sgt. Murray had returned to the room and announced that he had
    “absolutely no doubt” the appellant had caused Jane’s death, thus reinforcing
    the appellant’s jeopardy –

    Murray immediately reminded him of his rights.  The videotape shows the appellant
    nodding twice and saying “uhm, hum”.  This was about thirty minutes before

    confronting the appellant with his accusation and reminding him of his rights
    following the polygraph test, Det. Sgt. Murray embarked upon what the trial
    judge characterized as his 26 minute “plea” to garner the appellant’s agreement
    to the less serious of two possible alternative versions of how the death
    could have occurred, namely either the high version of deliberate murder
    or the low version of spontaneous unplanned violence resulting from a gentle
    but wronged man being “pushed too far” and
    “things just [getting] out of control”.  Eventually, the appellant begins
    shaking his head “no” to the more serious scenario and nodding his agreement

    record that there was a sufficient factual connection between the prior s.
    10(b) caution and subsequent reminders, on the one hand, and the appellant’s
    detention, the reasons for that detention and his jeopardy in relation to
    it, on the other.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was properly advised of his <i>Charter</i> rights to counsel and
    to remain silent at the outset of the interview and reminded of his s. 10(b)
    rights more than once thereafter.  The evidence is clear, as the trial judge
    found, that he understood both the full informational component of his right
    to counsel, and how to implement that right, at all times: see <i>Bartle</i>.  He
    could have exercised that right at any time during the interview, but chose
    not to do so.  The evidence is also clear that he understood from the outset
    that he was a suspect in a homicide case and that if he had caused Ms. Chalmers’ death
    he was in jeopardy of being charged with a homicide offence in that regard.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the appellant’s status may have shifted from a person who was being questioned
    as part of the investigation to a person who was being detained, at the point
    of his first admission, there was no magical change in his understanding
    of the position he was in, or of his rights and how to exercise them, or
    of his jeopardy.  The fact that the appellant and Det. Sgt. Murray engaged
    in a discussion about ready access to a private call with a lawyer barely
    seconds before his admission is particularly telling.  To repeat the observation
    of Gonthier J. in <i>Schmautz</i>, at p. 574:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Finding a <i>Charter</i> violation upon the sole
    fact that the warning was read before detention arose would be demonstrative
    of a legalistic and technical approach having little regard to the purpose
    of s. 10(b) …</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is not a case like <i>Amyot</i> where the accused’s emotional disintegration
    rendered the statement involuntary and may have deprived him of his ability
    to appreciate the s. 10(b) caution and make an informed decision about retaining
    counsel.  Here, the appellant remained composed and appeared to be in a controlled
    and stable emotional state throughout.  Nor is it comparable to either <i>Paternak</i> or <i>McIntosh</i>,
    where it seems clear that the status of the accused and his jeopardy had
    changed significantly between the time of the original caution and the subsequent
    reminder.  As noted above, there was no such change here.  It is not apparent
    from the brief endorsement of Sopinka J. in <i>Paternak</i>, what facts the
    Supreme Court relied on in allowing the appeal; however, the appellant’s
    factum in the Supreme Court in that case appears to indicate that Mr. Paternak
    was initially interviewed as a witness and that he was never told he was
    a suspect prior to the point of his detention.  I note that in <i>R. v. Barton</i> (1993),
    81 C.C.C. (3d) 574, this Court upheld the admissibility of a statement where,
    like this appellant, Mr. Barton had been made aware from the outset of the
    polygraph interview that he was a suspect in the crime under investigation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    while it is clear that the close factual connection relating the warning
    to the detention is all that is required to satisfy s. 10(b) where the warning
    is given before the detention, I note that the there was also a close temporal
    connection between the earlier warnings and the appellant’s detention.  He
    was initially cautioned between around 12:56 and 1:10 p.m., and was reminded
    again of his rights at 3:51 P.M., after the polygraph test and only about
    half an hour before the first confession.  The final conversation about consulting
    a lawyer, before the admission, occurred only moments before that happened.  The
    appellant never left the same interview room and he never dealt with anyone
    other than Det. Sgt.

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would accordingly dismiss this ground of appeal.  There is therefore no need
    to deal with the issue of whether the statements should have been excluded
    under s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>IV.       THE FAILURE TO LEAVE
      MANSLAUGHTER TO THE JURY</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that the trial judge erred by failing to leave the potential
    verdict of manslaughter to the jury, contending that he may have lacked the
    requisite intent for second degree murder.  In my view, this ground of appeal
    must also be rejected.</p>
  <h3>(1)       The impugned portion of the charge to the jury</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the impugned portion of the charge to the jury –
    after a pre-charge conference and with the agreement of defence counsel – the
    trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Again, the three elements are causation by an unlawful
    act with murderous intent.  The question you are deciding is the first element,
    causation.  Did Mr. Chalmers cause the death?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If you are satisfied that Mr. Chalmers caused Janie’s
    death, beyond a reasonable doubt, there would be no question of the two remaining
    elements, unlawfulness and murderous intent.  Although there are three elements
    to murder, on this evidence, you need only decide the question of causation.  On
    the fact situation of skull fractures and brain contusions, the decision
    turns on the issue of causation.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If you find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that Mr.
    Chalmers caused the skull fractures and brain contusions which caused the
    death, then you would also find the other two elements, namely the causing
    of the skull fractures was unlawful and done with the intention to cause
    death.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Those other two elements would flow naturally from
    your finding of causation.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This is so because there could be no lawful justification
    for causing skull fractures and brain contusions, and because a person is
    presumed to intend [the] natural consequences of his act, in deciding whether
    John Chalmers intended or meant to cause the death of Janie Chalmers, you
    are entitled, as a matter of common sense, to draw an inference that a sane
    and sober person intends the natural and probable consequences of his voluntary
    actions.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Death is the natural consequence of skull fractures
    and brain contusions.  By focusing on the issue of causation, you are led
    to the following alternatives:  If you are satisfied beyond a reasonable
    doubt that Mr. Chalmers did cause the skull fractures and brain contusions,
    then you must find him guilty of second degree murder.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If you are not satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt
    that Mr. Chalmers did cause the skull fractures and brain contusions, then
    you must find him not guilty of second degree murder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Underlying
    these instructions is the premise that –
    assuming the jury was satisfied the appellant caused his wife’s death – the
    elements of unlawfulness and murderous intent were made out because of the
    nature of the injuries sustained and the common sense inference that the
    appellant is presumed to have intended the natural and probable consequences
    of his acts.  So framed, the charge unquestionably “took away” the issues
    of intent and manslaughter from the jury.  The issue is whether the trial
    judge was justified in doing so in the circumstances.</p>
  <h3>(2)       The Appellant’s Argument</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant accepts that it was open to the jury – assuming it was satisfied
    he had caused Ms. Chalmers’ death – to conclude that he had the requisite
    intent for murder.  However, he submits that it was not inevitable the jurors
    would unanimously reach this conclusion on the evidence.  In this respect,
    he relies on a number of statements extracted in isolation from his lengthy
    inculpatory interview with Det. Sgt. Murray and from his various inculpatory
    statements to DC Devolder and others.  Specifically, he points to his statements
    that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i)          he went looking for his wife on
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Waterworks Road hoping they “could talk and see what was going on”; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii)         “we got talking and I think we got
    arguing”;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iii)        his wife said or did something that
    caused him to “crack” and to begin hitting her with an object he found on
    the ground;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iv)        his assault on his wife was “just a
    blur” and “everything just happened so …  ”; and </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(v)         he did not know whether Ms. Chalmers
    was dead or alive when he left the scene.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    evidence to support this ground of appeal is all found in the appellant’s
    out-of-court statements because there is nothing in his testimony at trial – or
    in the other defence evidence – that would sustain an argument that he lacked
    the requisite intent for murder.  His position at trial was unequivocal:
    if Ms. Chalmers’ death was not an accident, it was caused by someone else;
    he played no part in it.  There is no indication that alcohol or drugs played
    any role in the incident.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a>  There is nothing to suggest provocation within
    the meaning of s. 232(2) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  Indeed, the appellant
    confirmed in cross-examination that he never said Ms. Chalmers had done anything
    to cause him to hit her or that she had said or done anything that would
    have provoked the kind of reaction that he had admitted occurred.  Even when
    his attention was drawn to those excerpts in his statements containing the
    references upon which he now relies, the appellant made no comment on them
    and no attempt to suggest that his conduct was driven by blind rage or anger
    of the sort that may have affected his consciousness of the consequences
    of the actions attributed to him.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless,
    based on the foregoing evidence, the appellant says the jury might have had
    a reasonable doubt as to whether he had the necessary intent to commit murder,
    that is, whether he meant to cause his wife’s death or meant to cause her
    bodily harm that he knew was likely to cause death and was reckless whether
    death ensued or not.  As appellant’s counsel put it in their factum, the
    jurors might have had “a reasonable doubt as to whether the appellant had <u>subjectively</u> adverted
    to the effect of his actions;” they were “not <u>required</u> to reject the
    exculpatory aspects of the appellant’s statements and draw the ‘common sense
    inference’ of subjective awareness” (emphasis in original).</p>
  <h3>(3)       Analysis:  No Reversible Error in Jury Charge regarding the <i>Mens
      Rea</i> for Murder</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Some
    older jurisprudence suggests that manslaughter, based on the Crown’s failure
    to prove the requisite intent for murder beyond a reasonable doubt, must
    always be left to the jury in murder cases: see, for example, <i>R. v. Wright</i> (1979),
    48 C.C.C. (2d) 334 (Alta. C.A.), at pp. 339-343, leave to appeal refused.  Current
    authority confirms, however, that manslaughter should only be left as a possible
    verdict where that verdict has an “air of reality”: <i>R. v. Aalders</i>,
    [1993] 2 S.C.R. 482, at p. 484.  Where there is an “air of reality”, it may
    be necessary to leave manslaughter to the jury as a possible verdict, even
    where the defence has objected to that possibility being put to the jury:
    see e.g. <i>R. v.
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    Murray</i> (1995), 20 O.R. (3d) 156 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  At the same time, however, an accused has a constitutional right, albeit
    not an unlimited one, to control his or her own defence.  This right has
    recently been re-affirmed by this Court – along with its corresponding consequence
    of not being able to paddle downstream on appeal when one has paddled vigorously
    upstream at trial – in <i>R. v. MacDonald</i> (2009), <span class=ssl21>92
    O.R. (3d) 180 (C.A.).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Consequently,
    the appellant’s submission must be assessed in light of both the strength
    of the evidence relied on – it is present in isolated snippets – and the
    concessions made and position taken by the defence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant conceded the issue of intent at trial.  Experienced defence counsel
    approved the specific instruction given by the trial judge and agreed that
    there were only two verdicts available (guilty or not guilty).  In his closing
    remarks to the jury, in his submissions to the trial judge during the pre-charge
    conference, and in the written Counsel Input to the Charge, defence counsel
    took the position that this was a “1 issue case” with respect to the elements
    of murder: did John Chalmers cause Jane Chalmers’ death?  That is, if the
    jury rejected the riding-accident scenario and the alternative defence theory
    of a phantom killer, the only remaining issue was whether the appellant was
    the person who “murdered” Ms. Chalmers.  This was confirmed by defence counsel’s
    approval in advance the charge as delivered and by his failure to object
    to the charge following its delivery.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    following exchange took place between defence counsel and the trial judge
    during the pre-charge conference:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>THE COURT:                       There [are] three
    parts to a murder, causation, unlawfulness and mental ingredient.  The way
    I instructed the jury in the precedent you have of McKenzie, I told them
    that the decision turned on causation.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>DEFENCE COUNSEL:       Yeah.  That’s the one I
    applied Your Honour in terms of precedent.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>THE COURT:                       And if they find
    that Mr. Chalmers caused death then the two following questions follow automatically.  That
    is the way I would intend to instruct them so not to get them confused.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>DEFENCE COUNSEL:       Yes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>THE COURT:                       Are you happy
    with that?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>DEFENCE COUNSEL:       Yes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    result was the excerpt from the charge to the jury cited above. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    appeal, the appellant adopts the contrary stance, albeit acknowledging that
    trial counsel may have had good reasons for taking the position he took – it
    was conceded that, since the defence position was that the appellant did
    not kill his wife and that his statements to the police were false, trial
    counsel may have thought that leaving manslaughter and intent to the jury
    would undermine the appellant’s main defence.  Nonetheless, Mr. Campbell
    submits that the trial judge had a duty to instruct the jury on <u>all</u> defences
    that could arise from the evidence – whether the appellant wanted him to
    do so or not –
    and therefore that the trial judge’s failure to instruct the jury on the
    issues of intent and manslaughter cannot be justified.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not agree, for a number of reasons.   </p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>Marginal Air of Reality</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the argument is only as strong as the air of reality relating to the defence
    sought to be raised.  I accept that the threshold for meeting the air of
    reality test may not be high, given the Crown’s overall onus to establish
    guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.  I also accept that some of the factors
    outlined above on which the appellant now relies – was there an argument
    during which Ms. Chalmers said or did something that caused the appellant “to
    crack” and to assault her in what was just a “blur”? – <i>might</i> skim
    over the bar of the air of reality test, if considered in isolation, and <i>might </i>suffice
    to support leaving manslaughter to the jury, particularly in the face of
    a defence request to do so or even, perhaps, in the absence of such a request.  I
    do not accept that they have that effect here, however, given the generally
    unconvincing and unsupported nature of the facts relied on, the focus of
    the trial, and the way in which the case was put to the jury at the behest
    of the defence.  The position taken by the appellant is a telling indicator
    of the defence view of the air of reality of manslaughter in the crucible
    of this trial. </p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>Accused’s Right to Control Own Defence </span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    an accused has a constitutional right, albeit not an unlimited one, to control
    his or her own defence, and the trial judge’s instructions corresponded precisely
    with the way the defence sought to have its position framed to the jury.  The
    appellant was represented by experienced and competent counsel at trial,
    and no allegation of ineffective assistance of counsel is raised on appeal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    tension between an accused’s constitutional right to control his or her defence
    and the trial judge’s obligation to instruct the jury on defences that reasonably
    arise on the evidence has arisen in a number of cases.  A good example is
    this Court’s decision in <i>R. v. Murray</i>.  In that case, defence counsel
    specifically told the trial judge at the pre-charge conference that he did
    not seek and did not want a charge on intoxication.  The trial judge acceded
    to defence counsel’s request and did not instruct the jury on intoxication,
    even though there was a basis on the evidence for arguing that the accused’s
    ability to form the necessary intent for murder may have been affected by
    his drinking.  The appeal was allowed.  Osborne J.A. said this, at p. 170:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There is no doubt that the appellant had the right
    to control his defence.  This right is not, however, absolute.  This was
    made clear in <i>R. v. Swain</i>.  I am, however, reluctant to look at defence
    counsel’s tactical trial decisions through the rear view mirror of appellate
    review and in doing so second guess the appellant’s trial counsel, unless
    there are compelling reasons to do so. [Citation omitted.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Osborne
    J.A. was persuaded there were compelling reasons to interfere in the circumstances
    of that case, however.  The evidence of the accused’s drinking could have
    had an impact on the jury’s determination on the issue of murderous intent.  In
    arriving at his conclusion, Osborne J.A. was strongly influenced by the following
    remarks of Krever J.A. in a concurring opinion in <i>R. v. Lomage </i>(1991),
    2 O.R. (3d) 621 (C.A.), at p. 632:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I do not want to be understood as having the view
    that in a criminal case, to say nothing of a first degree murder case, in
    which the liberty of the subject is at stake, the adversary system operates
    in its pure form.  Just as the role of Crown counsel is not that of a pure
    adversary, so is the role of the judge modified.  The judge in a criminal
    case assumes a greater responsibility to see that justice prevails than that
    in the pure adversary system controlled by the performance of the opposing
    parties.  <i>Thus, for example, in a criminal case tried by a jury, the judge
    is obligated to instruct the jury with respect to defences that reasonably
    arise out of the evidence notwithstanding the defence advanced by counsel
    and, indeed, even over the objection of defence counsel</i>.  [Emphasis added.]  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>MacDonald</i>,
    however, this Court has reinforced the accused’s right to control his or
    her defence and to concede an essential element of the offence or admit criminal
    liability for an included offence without a formal guilty plea.  There, the
    accused had openly acknowledged at trial that he had unlawfully caused the
    victim’s death and that he was guilty of manslaughter, and had presented
    his defence on that basis.  With defence counsel’s concurrence, the trial
    judge directed the jury that there were only two possible verdicts: guilty
    of second degree murder and guilty of manslaughter.  On appeal, the argument
    shifted.  The accused submitted that he had been denied his constitutional
    right to a verdict by the jury.  Doherty J.A. upheld the trial judge, concluding
    that an accused has a constitutional right to control his own defence and
    to choose to remove an acquittal from the list of possible verdicts if so
    advised.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[3]</span></span></span></a>  At paras. 35-36 he said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Fundamental justice requires that the appellant
    be allowed, in the conduct of his defence, to acknowledge his culpability
    for manslaughter and leave the jury with the question of whether he was guilty
    of manslaughter or murder.  In the exercise of his right to control his own
    defence, the appellant chose to remove an acquittal from the list of possible
    verdicts.  He had a constitutional right to do so.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>The trial judge’s instructions with respect
      to the possible verdicts were tailored and responsive to the appellant’s
      position throughout the trial.  She vetted the proposed verdicts with counsel
      to be sure that they reflected the decision that the appellant wanted the
      jury to make</i>.  The trial judge’s instructions as to the possible verdicts – guilty
      of murder or guilty of manslaughter – did not deny the appellant a verdict
      by the jury he had chosen; instead, <i>her instructions framed the question
      for the jury in exactly the way the appellant wanted it framed</i>.  In
      the circumstances, the instruction that precluded an acquittal respected
      both the appellant’s constitutional right to a trial by jury and his right
      to control his own defence. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,
    the issue is not the removal of an acquittal from the jury’s consideration
    but rather the removal of an element of the offence conceded by the appellant
    and the potential reduction of murder to manslaughter.  However, if it is
    permissible to withdraw <i>an acquittal</i> by tailoring the jury instructions
    to reflect the way the defence wishes the question to be framed for the jury,
    it must equally be permissible, in appropriate circumstances, to withdraw
    manslaughter as well.  That is what happened in this case.  </p>

    verdict of manslaughter to require it to be put to the jury, in spite of
    the position taken by the appellant at trial, this is a case where the appeal
    on this ground should be dismissed on proviso grounds under s. 686(1)(b)(iii)
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  There was no substantial wrong or miscarriage
    of justice in the circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Campbell concedes the defence position taken at trial was reasonable.  The
    appellant’s position was that he did not kill his wife and that his statements
    to the police to that effect were false.  Indeed, the appellant’s position
    was that, if the death was not an accident, someone else had murdered Ms.
    Chalmers and dumped her body at the side of the road.  Manslaughter, based
    on his lack of specific intent, was inconsistent with – and might unnecessarily
    complicate – this stance.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    noted, some of the facts relied on by the appellant may just skim the bar
    of the air of reality test when considered in isolation.  But when scrutinized
    in the context of the evidence as a whole, and particularly when viewed through
    the prism of the defence position at trial, the air of reality to manslaughter
    is marginal at best.  The defence conceded the issue of intent.  The sound
    tactical reasons for doing so were no doubt buttressed by the nature of the
    injuries sustained by Ms. Chalmers and by the lack of any medical or other
    persuasive evidence to the effect that the appellant was not acting consciously
    and voluntarily.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    being the case – if the jury accepted that it was the appellant who caused
    the death – it is difficult to conceive of a scenario where he did so without
    the requisite intent for murder.  The evidence was that Ms. Chalmers suffered
    five skull fractures from blows administered by a long pipe-like instrument.  Such
    an instrument was found by the police in the field adjoining the crime scene,
    more or less where the appellant told them he had thrown the object he used.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I

  <h3>(1)       The Proposed Fresh Evidence: Dr. Holt’s Accident Theory</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    noted at the outset, Dr. Holt is a professor emeritus in kinesiology at
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Dalhousie
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    University.  He prepared a report entitled “A kinesiological/biomechanical
    analysis of the events leading to the death of Jane Chalmers”.  The appellant
    seeks to qualify him as a kinesiologist “capable of giving expert opinion
    evidence about movement of horses and people” and “about the mechanisms of
    how a person might fall off a horse and sustain injuries by striking the
    ground.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Holt has a Ph.D. in education.  He has spent his career teaching and studying
    in the area of human kinesiology – “The field of study concerned with the
    mechanics of (human) bodily movement” (<i>The Oxford English Dictionary</i>,
    2d ed., <i>s.v. </i>“kinesiology”).  His particular area of expertise is
    in the biomechanics of human sport and exercise activities.  His professed
    expertise in relation to this case comes from a combination of his knowledge
    of kinesiology, and the fact that his wife is (or was) an equestrian and
    he has observed and videotaped the movements of her quarter horses over a
    number of years.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Holt was retained to opine on whether it was possible for Ms. Chalmers to
    have sustained her fatal injuries through an accidental fall from her horse.  He
    examined photographs, along with other existing evidence relating to the
    incident to reconstruct a possible accident based upon what he refers to
    as the “emerging field” of forensic kinesiology.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Holt’s theory that Jane Chalmers’ death could have been accidental can be
    summarized as follows.  Dr. Holt suggests that Ms. Chalmers was riding on
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Waterworks Road when her horse suddenly spooked and engaged in a sharp counter-clockwise
    turning motion, much like a quarter horse in a “barrel racing turn”, in order
    to avoid some unknown threatening situation.  Not anticipating this abrupt
    stop and spinning movement, Ms. Chalmers began to fall from her horse, but
    her right foot slipped forward through the stirrup and got caught.  Because
    her foot was trapped, the horse’s rotary movements were transferred to Ms.
    Chalmers body, causing her body to be swung in an arc, and causing her head
    to strike the ground multiple times in a circular path, before her foot came
    loose and her body slid into the ditch.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    theory explained what Dr. Holt identified from a photograph of the scene
    as hoof prints showing a tight turn, as well as the pattern of various blood
    stains on Waterworks Road, and the five linear fractures on Ms. Chalmers’ skull – on
    Dr. Holt’s analysis her head only struck the ground four times, but he hypothesized
    that the first blow caused a double fracture.  Although the evidence of the
    pathologist at trial was that the linear skull fractures were most likely
    caused by a linear object, Dr. Holt explained the linear fractures as follows: “The
    reason for linear rather than depressed fractures was due to the materials
    that made up the road.  It was a mixture of dirt, sand, gravel and small
    rocks that together constituted a ‘softer’
    striking surface than either asphalt or compressed rocks.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, the Crown led evidence designed to show that death as a result of
    a riding accident was unlikely.  Two pathologists, a forensic anthropologist,
    and a veterinary school professor who was also an equestrian, testified in
    that regard.  They regarded an accident scenario as unlikely because Ms.
    Chalmers’ injuries were inconsistent with that typically expected in a horse
    riding accident.  The injuries sustained were inconsistent with Ms. Chalmers
    having been kicked in the head by the horse, as the lacerations were not
    hoof-shaped, and her injuries were to both sides of the head.  If Ms. Chalmers
    had simply fallen off the horse, without being kicked, she would have hit
    her head only once, probably on the back of the head.  Had she fallen with
    one foot caught in a stirrup, typically she would have fallen on her hands,
    arms or back, striking the back or possibly one side of the head, which again
    fails to explain the skull fractures on both sides of the head.  In addition,
    a blood spatter expert testified that the blood stains shown in the photographs
    of the road were not the result of Ms. Chalmers’ head hitting the ground
    in successive split second contacts.  Rather, those stains were caused by
    passive bleeding – blood droplets repeatedly falling from a source directly
    above, but not touching, the area for seconds, and possibly minutes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Holt does not dispute the theory that Ms. Chalmers’
    injuries were not caused by horse kicks.  However, he claims that horse kicks
    are not the only way that multiple skull fractures might have occurred in
    a riding accident, advancing the alternative construction outlined above.</p>
  <h3 style='page-break-after:avoid'>(2)       The Failure to Satisfy the Test
    for Admission of Expert Evidence</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I have stated, the proposed fresh evidence does not satisfy the test for
    admission of expert evidence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    essential criteria for the admissibility of expert evidence, as articulated
    in <i>Mohan</i>, are: (i) relevance; (ii) necessity in assisting the trier
    of fact; (ii) the absence of an exclusionary rule; and (iv) a properly qualified
    expert.  In my view, Dr. Holt is not a properly qualified expert.  In addition,
    the innovative scientific theory and technique he advances cannot survive
    the
    “special scrutiny” that authorities such as <i>Mohan</i>, <i>J.-L.J.</i>,<i> </i>and <i>Trochym</i> require
    of novel science in order to ensure its reliability. </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whatever
    special knowledge and skill Dr. Holt brings to the proposed fresh evidence
    can fairly be said to be based upon a novel scientific theory or technique.  At
    present there is no such thing as “forensic kinesiology” as a recognized
    sub-discipline of kinesiology.  Dr. Holt candidly acknowledges this.  He
    hopes it will become a recognized discipline some day, and has co-authored
    an article that has recently been accepted for publication in an American
    medical journal making the case for such a development.<a

'>[4]</span></span></span></a>  In addition, Dr. Holt’s knowledge – such as it
    is – with respect to equine movement and the actions of humans falling off
    of horses is based solely on his practical experience gained over 25 years
    ago in the course of filming his wife’s riding activities, together with
    the fact that he and his wife have stabled her horse for many years.  He
    has done no formal studies.  He has no accreditation.  He has never taken
    or taught a course in equestrian anatomy, equestrian physiology, or equestrian
    behaviour, and does not claim to be an expert in equestrian behaviour.  </p>

    for that reason alone.  However, the court has an important gatekeeper function
    to perform.  As Sopinka J. said in <i>Mohan</i>, at p. 25, “expert evidence
    which advances a novel scientific theory or technique is subjected to special
    scrutiny to determine whether it meets a basic threshold of reliability and

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the theories and techniques underpinning Dr. Holt’s “kinesiological/biomechanical
    analysis of the events leading to the death of Jane Chalmers” respond to
    none of these factors.  They have not been tested or – as yet, at any rate – subjected
    to peer review and publication.  There are no known standards against which
    to measure the analysis.  The theory and techniques cannot be said to be
    generally accepted.  Indeed, in the only known case where Dr. Holt has testified
    and there has been a verdict – a baby shaking syndrome case, not an equestrian
    accident case – the court was critical of his testimony and rejected it:
    see <i>R. v. Stewart </i>(2002), 212 N.S.R. (2d) 250 (S.C.), aff’d (2003),
    221 N.S.R. (2d) 205 (C.A.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    proposed fresh evidence is off to a shaky start on this basis alone, in my
    opinion.  Dr. Holt’s qualifications as an “expert” for the purposes for which
    it is sought to tender his evidence – the movement of horses and people and
    the mechanisms of how a person might fall off a horse and sustain injuries
    by striking the ground
    – do not advance the cause.</p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>Lack of Special Expertise in Equestrian
        Matters  </span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not question Dr. Holt’s expertise in his lifetime area of teaching and
    study: human kinesiology.  His particular area of expertise, he concedes,
    is in the biomechanics of human sport and exercise activities.  But, apart
    from his practical experience with his wife’s horses, and the exercise of
    filming her riding activities, he has no accreditation or research-based
    knowledge in equestrian matters.  No studies.  No courses taught or taken
    with respect to equestrian anatomy or behaviour.  He acknowledges that he
    is not an expert in horse-riding safety (although his report contains opinions
    that would require such expertise).  He acknowledges that he is not a blood
    spatter expert (although critical to his theory is his interpretation of
    the blood stains, and the positioning of the blood stains, seen in the crime
    scene photographs).  He acknowledges that he has no medical training (although
    his report makes assumptions that could only be based on such knowledge).  I
    would have considerable concerns about qualifying Dr. Holt to give “expert” evidence
    about the mechanisms of how a person might fall off a horse and sustain injuries
    by striking the ground.</p>
  <h3>(3)       The Failure to Satisfy the Test for Admission of Fresh Evidence</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    foregoing would be sufficient to dispose of the fresh evidence application.  Apart
    from my concerns over the admissibility of the proposed evidence as expert
    evidence, however, I am satisfied as well that the fresh evidence does not
    meet the <i>Palmer</i> test.  That four-part test states that fresh evidence:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1)
            should generally not be admitted if, by due diligence, it could have
    been adduced at trial (provided that this general principle will not be applied
    as strictly in a criminal case as in civil cases);</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2)
            must be relevant in the sense that it bears upon a decisive or potentially
    decisive issue in the trial;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3)
            must be credible in the sense that it is reasonably capable of belief;
    and,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(4)         must be such that if believed it could
    reasonably, when taken with the other evidence adduced at trial, be expected
    to have affected the result. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,
    the proposed fresh evidence runs afoul of at least the first, third and fourth
    criteria.</p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>Lack of Due Diligence</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“Due
    diligence” is admittedly not as compelling a factor in criminal cases as
    it is in civil cases.  As Major J. noted in <i>R. v. G.D.B.</i>, [2000] 1
    S.C.R. 520, at paras. 19 and 20, “[it] is not an essential requirement of
    the fresh evidence test, particularly in criminal cases”, and appellate courts “should
    determine the reason why the evidence was not available at trial.”  Here,
    however, Dr. Holt’s proposed evidence could readily have been made available
    at trial and there is no persuasive reason provided on the record as to why
    it was not if, indeed, it is as important to the appellant’s case as he now
    submits.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the Crown made no attempt to prove that a riding accident causing Ms. Chalmers’ death
    was physically impossible, the Crown did argue that such an event was unlikely,
    and the issue was very much in play at trial.  Dr. Brooks, an expert consulted
    by the Crown two years prior to trial, speculated about a stirrup-related
    accident and his letter containing that suggestion was disclosed to the defence
    in a timely fashion.  The defence’s own expert, Dr. Ben-Aron, a psychiatrist
    consulted in relation to the voluntariness and reliability of the appellant’s
    confessions, also raised the possibility of a spooking-related accident.  The
    defence made no attempt to lead any expert evidence to this effect.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Indeed,
    whatever explanation can be gleaned from the record for the defence not calling
    such evidence would seem to suggest that the defence made a calculated decision <i>not</i> to
    pursue the strategy of attempting to raise a reasonable doubt on the basis
    of a death-by-riding-accident theory.  Rather, it virtually conceded that
    there had not been an accident.  In closing to the jury, defence counsel
    said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Now, one of the elements that has to be proven
    beyond a reasonable doubt … is that Jane Chalmers was murdered … And His
    Honour is going to give you some direction as it relates to experts, but
    I don’t think you should be swept off your feet by what they say.  And in
    this particular case [Dr. Houpt, the veterinarian expert] says it was probably
    not the horse, and the horse is unlikely to have caused the death of Jane
    Chalmers.  You have to determine whether or not that’s proof beyond a reasonable
    doubt.  We have Dr. Spence and Dr. Shkrum once again saying that’s unlikely.  Whether
    or not that constitutes proof beyond a reasonable doubt, I don’t know. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Instead,
    the defence adopted what the Crown called the
    “phantom killer” approach.  In closing submissions, defence counsel advanced
    the theory that the jury “could very easily find that Jane Chalmers was not
    killed where she was found” and suggested that Don and Kay Moore may have
    been involved since they may or may not have “continued to be suspects at
    the time [the appellant] gave what he construes to be his false confession” and
    since there may have been a love-triangle related motive.  Defence counsel
    noted that “the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Moore’s had a horse trailer.  So, you wouldn’t have to speculate … beyond
    that as it relates to transport.”  The alternate suspect homicide theory
    had the advantage of being consistent with the testimony of the Crown’s blood
    spatter expert regarding the blood stains at the scene.  For Dr. Holt’s theory
    of accident to work, however, a completely different and inconsistent interpretation
    of those blood stains is required.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    short, defence counsel had good reason for not pursuing the riding-accident
    theory vigorously.  I pause to note again that there is no attack launched
    on this appeal based on the ineffective assistance of counsel.  In these
    circumstances, I do not think this is a case where the due diligence requirement
    of <i>Palmer</i> can be ignored.</p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>The proposed fresh evidence is neither
        reasonably capable of belief, nor can it reasonably be expected to have

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    there are significant frailties in the proposed fresh evidence itself.  In
    my opinion, it is simply not sufficiently reliable to meet the <i>Palmer </i>criteria
    of being reasonably capable of belief, nor can it be reasonably expected
    to have affected the result at trial.  Without engaging in an exhaustive
    analysis of the weaknesses, the following, in particular, come to mind.</p>
  <h3><i><span style='font-weight:normal'>(i)        The “one of a kind” nature
        of the theorized accident</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    Dr. Holt acknowledges that, in his accident reconstruction methodology, it
    is not possible to duplicate the suggested scenario because such incidents
    are “one of a kind events” and because it is
    “virtually impossible to repeat [the] movements” taking place at the time
    of the incident.  In Dr. Holt’s view, it was not possible to film a re-creation
    of the imagined incident using scale models.  Accordingly, it was not possible
    to test or verify the way in which it is suggested the accident occurred.  He
    acknowledges that, in terms of the statistics on equestrian-related injuries,
    it is “virtually impossible to correlate observed injuries with mechanism
    of injury on a substantive basis.”  Consequently, “it is impossible to go
    back and reconstruct and get accurate data [on riding accident events]”.  </p>
  <h3><i><span style='font-weight:normal'>(ii)       Conclusions based on speculation </span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    it appears to me that Dr. Holt’s most important conclusion – that his accidental
    death scenario represents the most reasonable explanation of the events leading
    to Ms. Chalmers’ death – is founded more on assumption and speculation than
    on scientific theory, verifiable technique, or the evidence.  Indeed, Dr.
    Holt acknowledges that his report incorporates a lot of “interpretation” and
    even some speculation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    portion of Dr. Holt’s report setting out his accident scenario begins by
    indentifying four specific markings shown in photographs of the road taken
    at the time as “hoof prints” and not only as hoof prints, but as hoof prints
    demonstrating a sharp pivoting counter-clockwise manoeuvre by the horse.  Based
    on those assumptions, and his assumption that Ms. Chalmers did not have the
    motor coordination or agility to ride this horse, he then concludes that
    the blood stains depicted in photographs of the road were the result of Ms.
    Chalmers’ head striking the ground when she fell from the pivoting horse,
    caught her foot in the stirrup and was swung in a semi-circular fashion until
    her foot came free of the stirrup, at which point the impact of centrifugal
    force ceased and she rolled straight into the ditch.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Appendices attached to these reasons help illustrate his hypothesis.  Appendix
    A is a drawing appended to Dr. Holt’s report depicting a human body in various
    positions and representing Dr. Holt’s theory of where Ms. Chalmers’ body
    struck the ground and ended up.  It is to be compared with Appendix B, which
    is a mocked-up version of a photo taken at the crime scene and showing a
    series of blood stains on the road.  The black and red markings on Appendix
    B were drawn over the photo by Dr. Holt during cross-examination to demonstrate
    his view of the trajectory of the victim’s head and the points of impact
    on the ground.  Appendix C is a photograph of the road showing what Dr. Holt
    identifies as the four pivotal hoof prints, which are circled in red ink.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Holt summarized his theory in this regard in cross-examination as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>May I add that those [i.e. the hoof prints circled
    in red on Appendix C], in my opinion, are the initiating prints that the
    horse made when he initiated this movement.  And I think they are the deepest
    and they appear to me to be facing forward and to the right.  In other words,
    they’re angled forward and to the right and the depression gives me the indication
    that they initiated a turn to the left.  That is what I read from those prints. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:
center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I’m saying that the pattern of movement will not
    be in a straight line.  She was not, in my view, going from point A in a
    straight line to point B and then reversing her direction or changing her
    direction and going in a straight line to C.  My point is that she is thrown
    into a path, a curved path.  And as the horse turns, that predicts what or
    determines the curvature.  And she then strikes down in that curved path
    until she releases from the hose and there’s no centrifugal force anymore.  Then
    she goes off in more of the last portion of your diagram in a straight manner
    to the final circle that you’ve drawn [i.e., point D]. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    problem is there is no way to verify this theory, and it does not appear
    to be very firmly founded on the record.  </p>
  <h3 style='page-break-after:avoid'><i><span style='font-weight:normal'>(iii)      “Hoof
        prints” indicating a “counter-clockwise” movement?</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    the horse did not spook and do a sharp <i>counter-clockwise</i> pivoting
    manoeuvre, Dr. Holt’s accident scenario is not possible.  No one at trial,
    including the Crown’s expert on animal behaviour, drew the inference that
    the four markings identified on Appendix C were hoof prints evidencing a
    turning movement by a horse, much less a counter-clockwise turning movement.  Dr.
    Holt was confident, however – based not on any academic expertise but rather
    on “whatever information a person like [himself] can gather in and around
    horses for 30 years, as a professional kinesiologist” – that his <i>intuition</i> enabled
    him to do so.  There is, he agrees, no scientifically recognized method for
    interpreting apparent disturbances of soil in a photograph and then reliably
    deducing what caused the disturbance.  He has no academic or other qualifications
    for providing “hoof print” opinion evidence.  Nor has he – or anyone else
    that he is aware of – ever been qualified by a court to interpret soil disturbances
    from viewing photographs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is of some weight that, while several witnesses at trial testified they saw
    hoof prints on the road in the general area of where the body was found,
    none identified the four markings isolated on Appendix C as hoof prints.  Dennis
    Spitzig, an experienced horseman himself, described the markings around the
    blood stains as
    “scuffle” marks.  Indeed, defence counsel himself described the markings
    as <i>footprints</i> in an attempt to bolster the theory of the phantom killers.</p>
  <h3 style='page-break-after:avoid'><i><span style='font-weight:normal'>(iv)      Head
        bouncing on the roadway? </span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    Ms. Chalmers’ head did not strike the roadway four times in the areas marked “A”, “B” and “C” on
    the photo, Appendix B, Dr. Holt’s accident scenario would not be possible.  Mr.
    McNeely argues on behalf of the Crown that there are several factors making
    such a scenario highly unlikely.  For one thing, one of the Crown’s experts
    gave evidence at trial explaining that a rider whose foot is caught in a
    stirrup would likely fall on her hands, arm or back, striking the back of
    the head, or possibly one side of the head, but Ms. Chalmers suffered injuries
    to both sides of the head.  More tellingly, Dr. Holt acknowledged that he
    is not a blood spatter expert, and ultimately conceded as well that “[his]
    scenario would not be consistent with [the Crown’s blood spatter expert]
    in terms of the way in which the blood was deposited.”  The Crown’s blood
    spatter expert testified that the blood stains shown in the photographs at
    points “A” and “B” were passive stains.  Passive stains result from blood
    droplets that fall by the force of gravity alone straight into the ground,
    leaving a somewhat circular pattern.  They are indicative of a blood source
    resting directly above – but not touching – the stain for at least a few
    seconds.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    in relation to Dr. Holt’s head-bouncing-on-the-roadway scenario, I observe
    that Dr. Holt could not, or did not, attempt to confirm whether it was even
    possible for a horse pivoting <i>at the location of the four “hoof prints</i>” he
    identified to have swung a 5’2” woman in a way that her bleeding head would
    have contacted the ground in the curved fashion coinciding with the location
    of the blood stains shown in the photos.  He admitted he could not tell exactly
    where Ms. Chalmers was when she came off the horse, or where exactly her
    head would have been, or what her position would have been, at any given
    point in time.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Holt was asked whether he could not have worked backward from where he says
    Ms. Chalmers’ head hit the ground and tried to come up with a range of locations
    where the horse would have had to have been.  His answer was as follows: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>No, the horse had to be pivoting in a relatively
    close proximity to where that action was taking place.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I found that a difficult thing to do.  I thought
    about it.  And I just could not come up with a way of identifying when the
    horse moved, when she moved, when the horse moved the second time, where
    she was when the horse moved.  This was a very difficult thing to visualize.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But
    the horse only had to be pivoting in relatively close proximity to where
    the action was taking place if one accepts the suggested riding accident
    scenario in the first place.  Whether a woman of Ms. Chalmers’ height could
    have been swung from a horse pivoting where the hoof prints were said to
    be located in a way that could lead to her head striking the ground at the
    blood stained locations was critical to Dr. Holt’s entire theory.  Based
    on little more than his belief that a horse turned suddenly – like a barrel-racing
    quarter horse might turn – in an area somewhere near the blood stains, and
    therefore that Ms. Chalmers <i>might</i> have slipped from the horse, and
    that her foot <i>might</i> have slipped through the stirrup, and that her
    head <i>might</i> have been swung in an arc that would cause it (maybe) to
    strike the gravel road at the point of those blood stains, the theory is
    speculative at best.  It is based on assumptions that do not seem to have
    any scientific or technical basis to support them.</p>
  <h3 style='page-break-after:avoid'>(4)       Fresh Evidence: Conclusion</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    conclusion, the proposed fresh evidence does not rest on any recognized and
    verifiable scientific theory or technique that would provide a reliable foundation
    for its admissibility as expert evidence.  Dr. Holt is not qualified to give
    expert testimony in the area in which the appellant seeks to have him do
    so, namely, as an expert kinesiologist “capable of giving expert opinion
    evidence about the movement of horses and people” and “the mechanisms of
    how a person might fall off a horse and sustain injuries by striking the
    ground.”  In the end, the proposed evidence is simply too frail and inconsistent
    with the proof at trial, to meet either the test for the admission of expert
    evidence under <i>Mohan</i> and<i> Trochym</i>, or the <i>Palmer</i> test
    for the admission of fresh evidence on appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would dismiss the fresh evidence application.</p>

lang=EN-US>VI.       SENTENCE APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the appellant seeks leave to appeal and, if leave is granted, appeals from
    the imposition of a period of parole ineligibility of 14 years.  He argues
    in favour of a period of 12 years, the bottom end of the 12-15 year range
    suggested by this Court as the appropriate range for brutal second-degree
    spousal murders: see <i>R. v. McKnight</i> (1999), 44 O.R. (3d) 263 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  The Crown had asked for a period of parole ineligibility of 15-17 years.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    this issue, the appellant submits that the trial judge erred in principle
    and in his appreciation of the evidence in two respects.  </p>
  <h3>(1)       Alleged Misapprehension of the Evidence</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues, first, that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence
    in concluding that he returned to the side road intending to kill his wife
    and “commenced hitting her immediately upon her dismounting from the horse” with
    a weapon he had brought to the scene, and erred in treating these as aggravating
    factors.  I do not agree.   While the appellant did maintain that he did
    not return to
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Waterworks Road with that intent and that he did not have a weapon with him,
    there was ample evidence elsewhere in his inculpatory statements to justify
    the findings the trial judge obviously accepted in this regard.  They were,
    indeed, aggravating factors for these purposes.</p>
  <h3>(2)       Alleged Errors in Principle</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the appellant contends that the trial judge’s reasons for imposing a sentence
    at the upper end of the <i>McKnight</i> range disclose several errors in
    principle.  These included: (i) treating as aggravating the fact that the
    appellant had remained at liberty for 15 years because the police had been
    led to conclude Ms. Chalmers’ death was an accident; (ii) treating as aggravating
    the withdrawal of his confession and lack of remorse; and (iii) failing to
    give proper weight to the recommendation of the jury.  Again, I would not
    give effect to these arguments.  </p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>Delay in Apprehension of the Appellant</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[112]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge considered the 15-year hiatus in the context of his assessment
    of the deterrence principle and, in particular, of the need to deter husbands “from
    taking advantage of circumstances in which they can kill their wives and
    let it look like an accident.”  He was troubled about what to do with this
    factor, but in the end concluded that “it [was] appropriate to consider the
    smoke-screen, so to speak, under which Mr. Chalmers committed his crime as
    an aggravating factor.”  At the same time, however, he gave it very little
    weight “because it [remained] possible that it was pure happenstance … that
    Mr. Chalmers committed his crime at a location and in circumstances which
    led to the horse being implicated.”</p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>Withdraw of Confession and Lack of
        Remorse</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[113]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge did focus to some extent on the appellant’s withdrawal of both
    his admissions and his show of remorse.  Generally, lack of remorse may not
    be treated as an aggravating factor for purposes of sentencing.  In <i>R.
    v. Valentini</i> (1998), 43 O.R. (3d) 178 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), at para. 82, for example, Rosenberg J.A. said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my view, a court must be very careful in treating
    lack of remorse as an aggravating circumstance.  A sincere expression of
    remorse can be an important mitigating factor and can reduce the sentence
    that might otherwise be imposed.  <i>Lack of remorse is not, ordinarily,
    an aggravating circumstance.  It should only be considered aggravating in
    very unusual circumstances</i> such as where the accused’s attitude toward
    the crime demonstrates a substantial likelihood of future dangerousness.  Even
    then the trial judge must be careful not to increase the sentence beyond
    what is proportionate having regard to the circumstances of the particular
    offence. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[114]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    case may be considered to be one of those “very unusual circumstances”, in
    my view.  As I read his reasons, the trial judge did not treat the withdrawal
    of the appellant’s show of remorse as an aggravating factor in relation to
    the appellant himself or seek to punish him for asserting his innocence.  Rather,
    the trial judge regarded these factors in the context of the further offence
    they created for Ms. Chalmers’ family.  The appellant had recanted what the
    trial judge saw as his real expression of the truth in his letter of apology
    to Ms. Chalmers’ mother.  Because there was no continuing confession and
    guilty plea, the body had to be exhumed, subjected to a further autopsy,
    and re-buried.  All of these components of the murder scenario brought further
    anguish and pain to the victim’s family.  I do not think the trial judge
    was precluded from considering them in the fashion he did for purposes of
    sentencing.</p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>Treatment of the Jury’s Recommendation</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor
    am I persuaded that the trial judge failed to give proper weight to the jury’s
    recommendation.  Two jurors made no recommendation.  Ten recommended that
    the period of parole ineligibility be left at the minimum 10 years.  Jury
    recommendations, however, are just that: recommendations.  They are not particularly
    well-informed, are generally made without any appreciation of the wider sentencing
    context, and need not be slavishly followed: see e.g. <i>McKnight</i>, at
    p. 278 (<i>per</i> Laskin J.A.), citing Watt J. with approval in <i>R. v.
    Barry</i>, [1991] O.J. No. 2666 (Gen. Div.), aff’d [1993] O.J. No. 3955 (C.A.).  Here,
    the trial judge “carefully considered”
    the jury recommendations and noted they had a “significant impact” on his
    decision.  He ultimately concluded, however – rightly so, in my view – that
    the appropriate period of parole ineligibility lay in the high to mid range
    suggested by this Court in <i>McKnight</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[116]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sentencing
    is a very fact-sensitive process and one with respect to which appellate
    courts afford considerable deference.  The trial judge considered all of
    the relevant principles of sentencing, generally, and the four criteria articulated
    by Parliament in s.&nbsp;745.4 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> relating to parole
    ineligibility, in particular.  His reasons demonstrate no misapprehension
    of the evidence or error in principle, in my opinion, and the 14-year period
    of parole ineligibility he imposed is well within the appropriate range for
    crimes of this nature.  I would not interfere with the sentence.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
