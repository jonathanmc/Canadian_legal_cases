    under the <i>Municipal Elections Act</i>, <i>1996</i>, S.O. 1996, c. 32 (the “<i>MEA</i>”)
    during the 2006 municipal election.  </p>

  <h2>THE FACTS</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms.
    Bussin was elected a councillor in the 2006
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto municipal election in the Beaches-East York, Ward 32.  Mr. St. Germain,
    an elector in the municipal election, believed that Ms. Bussin had contravened
    the <i>MEA</i> relating to her election campaign expenses.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The <i>MEA</i> provides
    a procedure through a compliance audit process for an elector who
    “believes on reasonable grounds that a candidate has contravened a provision
    of [the] Act relating to election campaign finances”: <i>MEA</i>, s. 81(1).  Under
    s. 81(2) of the <i>MEA</i>, an elector may apply to the clerk of the municipality
    for a compliance audit of the candidate’s election campaign expenses.  The
    application is heard by the municipal council or a committee established
    for this purpose by the council: <i>MEA</i>, ss. 81(3), (4).  The council
    for the City of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto established such a committee in respect of the 2006 election.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    application must be made within 90 days after a candidate has filed his or
    her financial statement and auditor’s report reflecting the candidate’s election
    campaign expenses: <i>MEA</i>, s. 81(2).  In this case, Ms. Bussin filed
    her financial statement and auditor’s report on March 26, 2007.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Under
    s. 81(3.3) of the <i>MEA</i>, a decision of the council or, as in this case,
    a decision of a committee, may be appealed to the Ontario Court of Justice.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If
    a compliance audit is ordered pursuant to the decision of a committee or
    by order of the court, the report of the audit is sent to the municipal council: <i>MEA</i>,
    s. 81(7).  After considering the report, the council “may commence a legal
    proceeding against the candidate for any apparent contravention of a provision
    of [the] Act relating to election campaign finances”: <i>MEA</i>, s. 81(10)<i>.</i></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is common ground between the parties, and so found by the application judge,
    that Mr. St. Germain did not follow the procedure in the <i>MEA</i>.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant alleges in his factum that he obtained a package of information
    regarding Ms. Bussin’s campaign expenses from the city clerk’s office that
    was incomplete.  He claims that it was only in late 2007 he learned that
    the clerk’s office had erred by providing him with an incomplete package
    that did not contain important information.  Counsel for Ms. Bussin responded
    in his factum that while it was not disputed that the appellant came into
    possession of certain information in the fall of 2007 it was not agreed that
    it was only in the fall of 2007 that the appellant discovered that he had
    been provided with incomplete material by the city clerk.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>One
    of the problems faced by this court and the court below is that the record
    is incomplete.  Neither the appellant nor Ms. Bussin filed any affidavit
    evidence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant claims that he sought to apply for a compliance audit but was out
    of time.  There is a letter in the appeal book from the city clerk dated
    December 18, 2007, which states:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>As of December 18, 2007, the Compliance Audit Committee
    received five requests for compliance audits.  None of the applications related
    to Councillor Bussin.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    any event, the appellant attended before a justice of the peace on December
    6, 2007, and, pursuant to s. 23 of the <i>Provincial Offences Act</i>, R.S.O.
    1990, c. P. 33, swore a private information against Ms. Bussin.  The information
    contained five counts alleging breaches of the <i>MEA</i> by Ms. Bussin.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    summons was issued by a justice of the peace on December 13, 2007, requiring
    Ms. Bussin to appear before the Ontario Court of Justice on January 15, 2008,
    to answer the charges.  Counsel for Ms. Bussin brought an application in
    the Superior Court on January 8, 2008, to quash the summons.  On January
    15, 2008, in the Ontario Court of Justice, the charges were adjourned to
    March 25, 2008, to set a date for trial.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    application to quash the summons was heard by the application judge on February
    4, 2008.  </p>
  <h2>THE REASONS FOR JUDGMENT OF THE APPLICATION JUDGE</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    application judge’s decision can be summarized from the following paragraph
    of his reasons:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The provisions of the MEA relating to the CAC [Compliance
    Audit Committee] are mandatory for an elector who, like the respondent, believes
    an offence has been committed against the campaign financing provisions of
    the Act by an elected official.  The MEA limits the rights of “electors” to
    commence such a prosecution at common law and under the <i>Provincial Offences
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.P. 33, as amended (“POA”) to the filing of an application
    for a compliance audit which may lead to a prosecution by the CAC alleging
    a violation of the campaign financing provisions of the Act by a candidate
    or an elected official.  The failure of the respondent to comply with the
    CAC provisions deprived the learned Justice of the Peace of jurisdiction
    to issue the impugned summons.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    reaching his decision, the application judge relied on this court’s decision
    in <i>Audziss v. Santa</i> (2003), 223 D.L.R. (4th) 257.  In that case, Mr.
    Audziss, an elector in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Thunder Bay, applied to the city council for a compliance audit concerning
    the election campaign expenses of Orville Santa, an elected councillor.  The
    city council rejected the application.  Mr. Audziss then brought an application
    in the Superior Court of Justice seeking relief (including a declaration
    that Santa’s election be declared null and void) under the <i>MEA</i> and
    the <i>Municipal Conflict of Interest Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. M.50.  Mr.
    Santa brought an application for a stay of the proceedings on the ground
    that the city clerk and the municipal council had exclusive authority to
    determine whether a candidate is in violation of the campaign expenditure
    provisions of the <i>MEA</i>.  The stay was granted. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Several
    weeks later, Mr. Audziss swore a private information before a justice of
    the peace alleging breaches of the <i>MEA</i> by Mr. Santa.  The justice
    of the peace issued a summons to Mr. Santa under the <i>Provincial Offences
    Act</i>.  Mr. Santa then brought an application to quash the summons, which
    was granted.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appeal from the order granting the stay of the proceedings in the Superior
    Court and the appeal from the order quashing the summons were heard together.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    dismissing the appeal in respect of the quashing of the summons, Charron
    J.A., writing for the court, said at paras. 27, 28 and 29:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>27.       The general right of a private person
    to lay an information in respect of an offence created by a provincial statute
    is found in s. 23(1) of the <i>POA</i> reproduced earlier.  The <i>MEA</i> is
    a provincial statute and it creates a number of offences.  There is no express
    restriction or limitation in the <i>MEA</i> on an individual’s right to lay
    an information in respect of any offences contained in that statute.  The
    question that arises is whether it is implicit that the Legislature intended
    to reserve that right to the council or local board of a municipality in
    respect of election campaign finances when it enacted s. 81(10).  As set
    out above, that section authorizes the council or local board, following
    the conduct of a compliance audit, to “commence a legal proceeding against
    the candidate for any apparent contravention of a provision of this Act relating
    to election campaign finances”.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>28.       I certainly agree with the applications
    judge’s comment that the statute is far from clear on whether an elector,
    or only council, can lay an information in respect of an alleged contravention
    of the <i>MEA </i>with respect to election campaign finances.  Nonetheless,
    when the provisions relating to election campaign finances are considered
    in their entirety, it is my view that the conclusion reached by the applications
    judge is the only one that can provide coherence to the legislative scheme.  Having
    regard to: a candidate’s obligations under the <i>MEA</i> in relation to
    election campaign finances; the automatic sanctions that apply upon the clerk
    serving notice of default; the elector’s right to apply for a compliance
    audit to ensure compliance with these provisions; the council’s obligation
    to consider that application and its power to appoint an auditor; the council’s
    obligation to consider any report resulting from a compliance audit and its
    power to commence a legal proceeding against the candidate for any apparent
    contravention of a provision relating to election campaign finances; and
    finally an elector’s right to seek judicial review in respect of the council’s
    decision; it is my view that the Legislature did not intend that an elector
    could simply bypass the whole process and lay a private information.  This
    interpretation is also one which, in my view, achieves a proper balance between
    an elector’s right to challenge an elected official in regard to his or her
    statutory obligations and the need to limit, and to ensure the legitimacy
    of, attacks on elected officials.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>29.       Hence, I would conclude that an elector’s
    general right to lay an information in respect of provincial offences has
    effectively been superseded by the legislative scheme contained in the <i>MEA</i> in
    relation to election campaign finances.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    application judge concluded that although the above statements of Charron
    J.A. related to an elector who had unsuccessfully applied for a compliance
    audit, they applied equally to an elector in the position of Mr. St. Germain
    who had not made such an application.</p>

    week before the argument of this appeal, counsel for Ms. Bussin filed his
    factum in which he stated the following in paragraphs 8, 9 and 10:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>8.         On March 25, 2008, the Respondent appeared,
    through her agent, at 9:00 a.m., in Courtroom C, Old City Hall Courthouse,
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto.  This was the return date of the information and summons that had
    been sworn by the appellant on December 6, 2007 and issued by a Justice of
    the Peace on December 13, 2007, respectively.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>9.         On March 25, 2008, the Respondent was
    arraigned on all of the charges and entered a plea of not guilty.  All charges
    against her were dismissed.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>10.       To the knowledge and belief of the Respondent,
    no appeal has been taken from the dismissal of the infor-mation.</p>

    for Ms. Bussin further submitted that this appeal should be quashed as moot.  In

    review of the transcript of March 25, 2008, reveals that the attendance on
    that day was for the purpose of setting a date for trial.  When the case
    was called before the justice of the peace, counsel for Ms. Bussin was present.  However,
    neither Mr. St. Germain nor his counsel was present.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When
    the provincial prosecutor called the Bussin case from the court list, Ms.
    Bussin’s counsel addressed the court as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><b>MR. PAAS:</b>  If I could speak to that, Your
    Worship.  This is numbers 10 to 14 on page one.  I represent Ms. Bussin,
    who is the defendant.  It’s a private complaint.  I don’t see anyone here.  I
    would recognize the complainant.  Obviously, my friend has called.  If there
    is no one here and it is a private complaint, I’d move to have the Informations
    [<i>sic</i>] quashed for lack – for want of prosecution.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>The justice of the peace then invited
    the provincial prosecutor, Mr. Knipe, to address the court.  He responded
    as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><b>MR. KNIPE:</b>  Well, I’m going to appear, Your
    Worship, I guess as – to assist the Court as a friend of the Court.  This
    is not a matter that really our office would have any jurisdiction over.  It’s –
    as I understand it, counsel has advised the Court that it’s a private prosecution
    brought by a citizen.  The citizen is not here.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Now, I understand that there was apparently some
    problem with process, presumably with the summons.  And I also understand
    that there may be some further steps being taken, and all of this – I really
    don’t know, but this is what I understand.  So, given – I’m not sure really
    what to – I have no comment one way or the other.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    discussion followed as to what should be done.  The justice of the peace
    suggested that since Mr. St. Germain was not present, the court should simply
    declare the prosecution as abandoned.  Counsel for Ms. Bussin submitted the
    charges should be dismissed.  The justice of the peace, at first, accepted
    the submission and then decided he wished to consider whether the charges
    should be abandoned or dismissed.  After a short recess, the justice of the
    peace instructed the clerk of the court to arraign the defendant.  Not guilty
    pleas by Ms. Bussin followed.  The justice of the peace then concluded:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Given that the complainant, who is also acting as
    a prosecutor in this case, is not in attendance, therefore, the Court – and
    the complainant who is acting as prosecutor has chosen not to participate,
    so, all these charges against Sandra Bussin will be dismissed for lack of
    prosecution.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    no time did Mr. Paas advise the court that there were proceedings in the
    Superior Court concerning this matter and that there was an appeal pending
    in the Court of Appeal.  He did not advise counsel for the appellant that
    he intended to ask for the charges to be dismissed if Mr. St. Germain did
    not appear by agent or in person on March 25, 2008 and he did not try to
    contact him on March 25.  Also, Mr. Paas did not advise counsel for the appellant,
    the appellant or this court that the charges had been dismissed on March
    25, 2008, until he served his factum which was filed in this court on September
    3, 2008 – one week before the argument of this appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    it would appear from the general comments made by Mr. Knipe, the provincial
    prosecutor, that he was aware there was “some problem … with the summons” and “that
    there may be some further steps being taken”, such information was obviously
    of little assistance to the court.  The fact is Mr. Paas said nothing to
    the justice of the peace concerning the proceedings in the Superior Court
    and the Court of Appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    written submissions received from Mr. Paas subsequent to the oral argument,
    he explained his conduct on the basis that there was a duty on the respondent, “the
    prosecutor”, to attend court on March 25, 2008, and that there was no duty
    on Mr. Paas to communicate with the respondent or his counsel.  According
    to Mr. Paas, any communication that assisted the appellant would conflict
    with his duty to his client to represent her in a resolute and partisan fashion.  While
    Mr. Paas stated that he could not mislead the court, he advised that any
    duty to inform the justice of the peace of proceedings in the Court of Appeal
    was superseded by his duty to his client.  He relied on Rule 4 of the Rules
    of Professional Conduct and the commentary that provides in part:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[A] lawyer’s duty is to protect the client as far
    as possible from being convicted … Accordingly,…a lawyer may properly rely
    on any evidence or defences including so-called technicalities not known
    to be false or fraudulent.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    respect of his failure to advise the court and the appellant of the dismissal
    of the charges until the filing of his factum in the Court of Appeal, respondent’s
    counsel advised:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It is submitted that failing to disclose the dismissal
    of the charges was an appropriate strategic or tactical decision made by
    counsel for the Respondent and consistent with the adversarial nature of
    the proceedings.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Since a potential for the appeal of the decision
    of the Justice of the Peace existed, it was thought by counsel for the Respondent
    that a tactical advantage would be gained the longer the matter was not reviewed
    by the Appellant.  In light of the quasi-criminal nature of the proceedings
    and the fact that the Appellant was represented by counsel, it is submitted
    that there was no duty to advise the Appellant prior to the filing of the
    Respondent’s factum and that it would have been contrary to counsel’s duty
    to the Respondent to defend her best interests.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>As to the duty to the court, counsel for the Respondent
    reviewed previous decisions where mootness was an issue on appeal.  It was
    determined that while the mootness question was sometimes dealt with as a
    separate, prior motion, the more normal course was to deal with a mootness
    challenge on the date set for the hearing of the appeal proper.  Counsel
    for the respondent felt that in those circumstances no over-riding duty to
    the court existed to raise the issue prior to the filing of the Respondent’s
    factum.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Not
    surprisingly, counsel for the appellant takes the opposite view of respondent
    counsel’s conduct and alleges that he breached his professional obligations
    as provided for in the Rules of Professional Conduct.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is not this court’s responsibility to determine whether there has been a
    breach of the Rules of Professional Conduct.  Such allegations should be
    dealt with by the Law Society.  The relevance of the conduct in question
    here is the effect it has on the question of whether the appeal is moot.  I
    now turn to that question.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    would appear that this case may now be moot as a result of the charges’ having
    been dismissed unless counsel for Mr. St. Germain has taken steps to restore
    the case to the list.  Since we have not heard otherwise, I assume that he
    has not. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>If
    the appeal is moot, it is moot because of the action taken by counsel for
    Ms. Bussin.  The court should not decline to hear this case in these circumstances.  This
    is particularly so where counsel for the respondent adopted a deliberate
    strategy to render the appeal moot.  In the unusual situation that presently
    exists I would therefore exercise our discretion to deal with this case.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Turning
    to the merits, I would dismiss the appeal for two reasons.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    I do not believe that the record before the court is sufficiently complete
    to permit an assessment of whether Mr. St. Germain was in a position to have
    made an application for a compliance audit within the 90-day prescription
    period.  We do not know what information he received from the city clerk’s
    office.  We do not know the nature of the alleged incomplete information.  We
    do not know any details concerning the appellant’s efforts to apply for a
    compliance audit.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    I agree with the analysis of the application judge and his adoption of this
    court’s judgment in <i>Audziss</i>.  I do not believe that the reasons for
    judgment of Charron J.A. can be, or should be, read as narrowly as counsel
    for the appellant submits.  In my view, Mr. St. Germain was obligated, as
    was Mr. Audziss, to follow the procedure prescribed in the <i>MEA</i> for
    an elector to pursue a complaint in respect of a candidate’s election campaign
    expenses.  Again, the record is not sufficient to assist in that regard.  On
    the record before us, it was not open to the appellant to proceed by way
    of private information.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the result, as indicated above, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
