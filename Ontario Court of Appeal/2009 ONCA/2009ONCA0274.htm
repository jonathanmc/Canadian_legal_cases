  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is a proposed class proceeding, not yet certified.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    appeal, the appellants argue that Sun Life Assurance Company impermissibly
    deducted or set-off the <i>Canada Pension Plan</i> Child Benefit from disability
    benefits paid under their disability policies.  A second issue on the appeal,
    and the issue raised by cross-appeal, concerns the $215,000 in costs awarded
    by Perell J. after a five-day trial.  The Law Foundation of Ontario, which
    has provided financial support to the appellants, is entitled to make submissions
    and is a party for purposes of the appeal in relation to costs, pursuant
    to rule 12.04 of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    did not call upon the respondent in oral argument with respect to the set-off
    issue.  The appeal will be dismissed in that regard, for reasons that I will
    outline briefly.  The main questions on the appeal and cross-appeal concern
    the principles upon which costs are to be awarded in class actions pursuant
    to s. 31(1) of the <i>Class Proceedings Act</i>, <i>1992</i>, S.O. 1992,
    c. 6 (the “<i>CPA</i>”) and the quantum of costs awarded by Perell J.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal and the cross-appeal
    with respect to costs as well.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>II.        BACKGROUND </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants, Mr. Ruffolo and Ms. Lepage, are both totally and permanently
    disabled – he, as a result of a brain injury suffered in a motor vehicle
    accident; she, as a result of degenerative disc disease, scoliosis and spinal
    stenosis.  Both have minor children.  Both are covered under group insurance
    policies with Sun Life that provide for long-term disability (“LTD”) benefits.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sun
    Life deducts from those LTD benefits the amount of disability benefits that
    the appellants receive for their dependent children under the <i>Canada Pension
    Plan</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-8 (the “<i>CPP</i>”).  The dependent disability
    benefits are a supplemental benefit to the CPP.  Known as the “CPP Child
    Benefit”, they consist of a monthly flat-rate payment (adjusted for inflation),
    and are unrelated to the dependent child or parent’s income.  They are payable
    by CPP to the dependent children and belong to them, although the amounts
    are received by the parents in trust for the children.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants commenced this action, asserting that it was wrong for their insurer
    to off-set their children’s CPP benefits from their own LTD benefits.  Sun
    Life responded that it was entitled, by the terms of the policies, to deduct
    the CPP Child Benefit from the amounts payable by it to the appellants under
    its group insurance policies.  The trial judge agreed, as do I.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>Mr. Ruffolo’s policy</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Ruffolo’s coverage is obtained through group insurance issued to his employer,
    Royal Plastics Limited.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two
    aspects of the Royal Plastics policy are pertinent to his claim.  First,
    the application for group insurance (which, by the terms of the policy, forms
    a part of the insurance contract) provides that LTD benefits will be subject
    to integration with other available benefits.  The applicant is asked to
    choose from a list.  Here, Royal Plastics chose the following method of integration:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[<b>X</b>] (a)    Immediately offset in all events,
    by all sources specified in the group policy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Other
    methods of integration which could have been selected as part of the application,
    including one that would have excluded dependent disability benefits payable
    under the <i>CPP</i>, were not chosen.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Secondly,
    the policy itself describes “sources specified in the group policy” for the
    purposes of integration as including:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a)       disability benefits paid or which may
    become payable under any plan … provided by any governmental or regulatory
    body, including The Canada Pension Plan”. [Emphasis added.]  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>Ms. Lepage’s policy</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Lepage’s coverage is through group insurance issued to the West Nipissing
    Association for Community Living.  The
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    West Nipissing policy provides that monthly LTD benefits are to be reduced
    by, <i>inter alia</i>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.         the disability income to which the disabled
    member is entitled under a government plan (including benefits under the
    Canada/Quebec Pension Plan, <i>including benefits for dependent children</i>)”.
    [Emphasis added.] </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>III.       DEDUCTION OF CPP CHILD BENEFIT PAYMENTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    a careful and full analysis of the terms of the policies, the principles
    of contractual interpretation, and the various public law/private law arguments
    put to him by the parties, the trial judge concluded that the language of
    the group insurance polices permitted Sun Life to deduct the CPP Child Benefits
    from the monthly LTD payments to be made to the appellants.  I agree.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>The clear terms of the policies permit off-setting of the CPP Child
      Benefit  </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    CPP Child Benefits, in my view, are “disability benefits … payable under
    the Canada Pension Plan” as contemplated in the Royal Plastics policy.  They
    are “benefits for dependent children”, as contemplated in the West Nipissing
    policy, and, in effect, are incorporated by contractual consent into the
    concept of “disability income to which the disabled member is entitled” under
    the <i>CPP</i> for purposes of the coverage.  Even though the CPP Child Benefits
    are not “disability income to which the disabled member is entitled” in a
    proprietary legal sense, the payments are made to the disabled parent in
    trust.  The disabled parent is entitled to receive them in that sense, which
    is sufficient under the terms of the policy.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>The insurance contracts are not contrary to the <i>Canada Pension
        Plan</i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor
    would I give effect to the argument that the trial judge erred in failing
    to find that the off-setting of CPP Child Benefits under the policies was
    in violation of the <i>Canada Pension Plan</i>.  Like the trial judge, I
    see no public policy reasons for not interpreting the private contractual
    arrangements between Sun Life and its insureds in the foregoing fashion.  The
    Act contemplates a scheme whereby the payment of CPP benefits and private
    disability benefits will be integrated.  Under that scheme, the CPP is the
    first payor of disability insurance and private disability benefits are typically
    designed to supplement those benefits to a level the policy holder and insurer
    negotiate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    65 of the <i>CPP</i> stipulates that a benefit under the Act “shall not be
    assigned, charged, attached, anticipated or given as security, and any transaction
    purporting to assign, charge, attach, anticipate or give as security a benefit
    is void.”  The appellants submit that permitting the disability insurer to
    set-off or deduct the CPP Child Benefit is tantamount to permitting the assignment
    of that benefit to the insurer.  Again, I do not agree.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    CPP benefits – including the CPP Child Benefit –
    remain unchanged in nature or quantum.  They are paid to the disabled person.  As
    the trial judge noted at para. 115, “what is diminished by offsets is the
    amount paid in private LTD benefits to the disabled employee.”  And as he
    later correctly observed, at para. 117, “there is nothing contrary to public
    policy in permitting insurer and insured to control and limit the amount
    of private LTD benefits [payable under private coverage].”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    the foregoing, it is unnecessary to deal with Sun Life’s argument that Mr.
    Ruffolo’s claim was statute barred from at least 1995 onward.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would accordingly dismiss the appeal on the issue of whether Sun Life was
    permitted to off-set the CPP Child Benefits.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>IV.       COSTS PURSUANT TO
      SECTION 31(1) OF THE <i>CLASS PROCEEDINGS ACT, 1992</i>.</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants submit that the trial judge erred in awarding any costs at all,
    given the regime codified in s. 31(1) of the <i>CPA</i>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b><i>Costs</i></b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>s. 31(1)  </b>In exercising its discretion with
    respect to costs under subsection 131(1) of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>,
    the court may consider whether the class proceeding was a test case, raised
    a novel point of law or involved a matter of public interest.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Four
    questions arise on the appeal and cross-appeal with respect to costs:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i)  Do the provisions of s. 31(1) of the <i>CPA</i> apply
    to the determination of costs in this case?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii)  If they do, what consideration, in particular,
    is to be given to the three factors specifically mentioned in that section?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iii)  Should this Court interfere with the trial
    judge’s decision to award costs?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iv)  Should this Court interfere with the quantum
    of costs fixed by the trial judge?</p>
  <h3>Application of the <i>Class Proceedings Act</i> </h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sun
    Life submits that the provisions of the <i>CPA</i> do not apply.  That is
    so, Sun Life argues, because although the plaintiffs in the actions were
    originally put forward as class plaintiffs, the actions were never certified
    as class proceedings and the parties agreed that they would be heard and
    finally determined as individual actions.  Sun Life simply acknowledged that
    it would be bound by the decisions in relation to any existing group insurance
    policies that paralleled the Royal Plastics and
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    West Nipissing contracts.  Therefore, Sun Life contends that costs should
    be governed only by s. 131 of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990,
    c. C.43, and the factors set out in rule 57.01(1).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge correctly rejected this argument, in my opinion.  A class proceeding
    is not an individual action until certification is granted.  Rather, it is
    a special type of action under the <i>CPA</i> that may be certified into
    a class proceeding or converted – but only with leave of the court – into
    a regular individual proceeding.  The trial judge analysed these propositions
    and the authorities supporting them at paras. 27-33 of his reasons, and I
    need not elaborate further here.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is sufficient to note that there has never been an order converting these
    actions into individual proceedings.  Accordingly, in spite of the parties’
    agreement to proceed to trial as if they were individual proceedings, they
    remain proceedings ultimately governed by the <i>Class Proceedings Act</i>,
    including the provisions of s. 31(1) of that Act.</p>
  <h3 style='page-break-after:avoid'>The Section 31(1) Factors</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    has been considerable discussion and debate in the jurisprudence about whether
    the provisions of s. 31(1) add anything to the court’s general discretion
    to determine costs under s. 131(1) of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>.  In <i>Gariepy
    v. Shell Oil Co.</i> (2002), 23 C.P.C. (5th) 393 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Ont.

    said that the factors mentioned in s. 31(1) were to be given “special weight”,

    ), Rosenberg J.A., on behalf of this Court, concluded that they “should be
    given significance”.  Rosenberg J.A. noted that to the extent <i>Gariepy</i> held
    to the contrary, he disagreed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the heart of the debate surrounding the impact of the specific reference
    to test cases, novel points of law and matters of public interest in s. 31(1)
    is the accepted principle that a court has always been able to – and will – take
    these factors into account in exercising its normal discretion to determine
    costs.  Is s. 31(1) merely a codification of existing principles, then, or
    did the legislature intend to import some particular significance to them
    in class proceedings?  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    debate has been resolved by this Court’s decision in <i>Pearson</i>, it seems
    to me.  As Rosenberg J.A. said, at para. 11: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[A]lthough s. 31(1) of the <i>CPA</i> does not
    replace the broad discretion under s. 131 of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>,
    since the legislature mentioned certain factors, where they apply, those
    factors should be given significance. [Footnote omitted.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, Rosenberg J.A. took into account the factors set out in rule 57.01,
    and in para. 13 summarized the principles and factors that he would apply
    in fixing costs on a certification motion (which is how the issue arose in <i>Pearson</i>).  These
    principles include the notion that costs must reflect what is fair and reasonable. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    short, s. 131 of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i> (and its companion, rule
    57.01) continue to apply to the determination of costs in class proceedings.  In
    such proceedings, however, the court will look to see whether any of the
    s. 31(1) factors apply – a test case, a novel point of law, a matter of public
    interest – and, if they do, will give them significance in the course of
    exercising its discretion in determining costs.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not think anything is to be gained by attempting to define the phrase “should
    be given significance” more precisely than just that.  Nor do I think there
    is any material difference between that phrase and the “special weight” language
    of <i>Caputo</i>.  The full context of Winkler R.S.J.’s comment on “special
    weight” was this (para. 32):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>More importantly, as stated above, the legislature
    has specifically identified three factors in s. 31(1) of the <i>CPA</i>.  To
    be consistent with the goals of the Act, <i>special weight</i> must be given
    to them in assessing costs in a class proceeding.  <i>In other words</i>,
    while a proper exercise of discretion must always be based on the facts before
    the court, <i>significance</i> must be also given to the existence or absence
    of the factors in s. 31(1). [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I interpret this, Winkler R.S.J. was more or less equating “special weight” and “significance” in
    assessing the manner in which the s. 31(1) factors were to be treated.  At
    the end of the day, for purposes of consistency, I would simply adopt the
    language of this Court in <i>Pearson</i>.  The s. 31(1) factors, when found
    to exist,
    “should be given significance” in the exercise of the court’s discretion
    to determine costs in the proceeding.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
    that “significance” will be will depend on the circumstances of the case.  To
    quote Laskin J.A., in <i>McNaughton Automotive Ltd. v. Co-Operators General
    Insurance Co.</i> (2008), 298 D.L.R. (4th) 86 (Ont.
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), at para. 35, “the decision of how much weight to accord these factors
    is discretionary.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    proper approach to the application of s. 31(1) is that it be seen – as Winkler
    R.S.J. observed in <i>Caputo</i>, at para 32 – “through the lens of the goals
    of the Act in the factual context of the case.”  The trio of goals underpinning
    the <i>CPA</i> are now well established.  They are: access to justice, behaviour
    modification and judicial economy.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The Decision to Award Costs</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, there is no error in principle in the trial judge’s decision to
    award costs in this case.  The general rule that costs follow the event applies
    in class proceedings in this province, just as it does in other forms of
    litigation.  As Rosenberg J.A. noted in <i>Pearson</i>, at para. 13, “
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario, unlike other class proceedings jurisdictions such as
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    British Columbia, has not sought to interfere with the normal rule that costs
    will ordinarily follow the event.”   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
    if the presence of one or more of the s. 31(1) criteria is found to exist,
    a court need not refrain from awarding costs to a successful defendant in
    a class action.  Otherwise, the continuing application of the “costs follow
    the event”
    regime to class proceedings would be rendered meaningless.  Whether a “no
    costs” order, or some adjustment to the costs as claimed, is appropriate
    to reflect the s. 31(1) factors will depend on the circumstances of each
    case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Garland
      v. Consumers’
    Gas Co.</i> (1995), 22 O.R. (3d) 767 (Gen. Div.), at p. 776, Winkler J. remarked
    that “[t]he case law reflects the court’s inclination to refrain from awarding
    costs against unsuccessful plaintiffs in class proceedings where some or
    all of the criteria in s. 31(1) are present.”  This may well be a fair observation
    of a general tendency, based on the authorities he cites, but at the same
    time Winkler J. also observed that he did not believe “the presence of more
    than one of the factors in s. 31(1) justifies refraining from an award of
    costs to a successful defendant in every case” (p. 777).  I agree.  There
    is no general rule that the presence of one or more of the s. 31(1) factors
    will necessarily lead to a no costs order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I do not accept the argument made by counsel for the Law Foundation that
    the presence of any of the s. 31(1) factors should, absent special circumstances,
    outweigh competing costs considerations and relieve an unsuccessful class
    plaintiff from an adverse costs award.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  Were that the operative principle, the financial
    exposure of class action plaintiffs (and, as a result, of the Law Foundation)
    would undoubtedly be diminished, since there is some foundation for the view
    expressed by Perell J. – in another case – that “class actions tend toward
    being test cases, the determination of a point of law, or the adjudication
    of matters of public interest”: <i>2038724 Ontario Ltd. v. Quizno’s Canada
    Restaurant Corporation</i>, (2008) CanLII 27822 (ON S.C.).  However, accepting
    the principle advanced by the Law Foundation would be inconsistent with the
    structure of the <i>CPA</i> and unfair to class action defendants, in my
    opinion, given the legislature’s clear decision to maintain the normal costs
    regime in class proceedings (subject to the foregoing observations).  While
    the court must always keep in mind the legislative goals of access to justice,
    behaviour modification, and judicial economy in arriving at its costs disposition,
    based on the facts, I do not see the interpretation advanced here as being
    in any way antithetical to those goals. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,
    the trial judge considered the s. 31(1) factors, and concluded that the case
    at bar:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>was “technically
    a test case,” but that this factor was neutral in the circumstances because “Sun
    Life cooperated in having the action proceed as it did, and it does not seem
    fair … that its cooperation should preclude it from claiming costs, if otherwise
    entitled to them” (para. 65);</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>did
    raise novel points of law (although the plaintiff’s stronger argument related
    to contractual interpretation, not a novel issue), but that “the novelty
    of the interaction of public law with private contracting” did not rise to
    the level to justify “totally denying Sun Life its costs” (para. 70); and </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>did
    raise a matter of public interest.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with these findings, which were not seriously contested on the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the conclusion of his analysis, the trial judge said (at paras. 77-79):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Very closely related to the issue of litigation
    that raises a matter of public interest and thus provides grounds for not
    making an order as to costs is the issue of the public interest litigant
    who litigates but seeks to be exempt from a costs order. In <i><span style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New Roman"'>Incredible
    Electronics Inc. v. Canada (Attorney General)</span></i><span style='font-family:
&quot;Times New \(W1\)&quot;;&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'> <span style='
color:windowtext'>(2006), 80 O.R. (3d) 723</span>, <span style='
color:windowtext'>[2006] O.J. No. 2155</span> (S.C.J.), I discuss</span> at
    some length the law and the literature about the public interest litigant,
    including intervenors, and I will not repeat that discussion here and simply
    note that I have considered it in determining whether and the extent to which
    the litigation before me can be considered to be a matter of public interest.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In the argument about whether this proceeding raised
    a matter of public interest and about how its being an action under the <i>Class
    Proceedings Act, 1992</i> should influence the court's discretion about costs,
    the Law Foundation, Mr. Ruffolo and Ms. Lepage argued that there were access
    to justice factors that were engaged because Mr. Ruffolo's and Ms. Lepage's
    personal interest was small and
    &quot;it must not be forgotten&quot; that &quot;this action was commenced
    on behalf of physically injured persons in Canada&quot; and that it sought
    &quot;to delineate legal entitlements on behalf of a group of extremely vulnerable
    class of persons, disabled individuals&quot;.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In exercising my discretion with respect to costs,
    I took these factors into account and attempted to make an award that would
    not discourage class proceedings or get in the way of the access to justice
    policies of the class proceedings legislation. However, I did not ignore
    the interests of the defendant Sun Life, and I thought that the submissions
    about the vulnerability of the plaintiffs were somewhat overstated. The proposed
    group or class for whom the action was originally brought were all former
    employees, some of whom like Mr. Ruffolo were relatively well-paid executives,
    and they were not disabled or vulnerable when the long-term disability insurance
    contracts were negotiated by their employers, who were free to negotiate
    insurance contracts that did not offset <i>Canada Pension Plan</i> benefits.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
    on these considerations, the trial judge concluded that this was not an appropriate
    case to make a no costs order.  I see no error in principle in the trial
    judge’s decision to award costs to Sun Life in the proceedings, and I would
    not interfere with that decision.</p>
  <h3>Quantum of Costs</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge made a costs award of $215,000 in favour of Sun Life.  The appellants
    submit this award is “one of the highest costs awards in the history of the
    Act against an unsuccessful plaintiff” and that it is “grossly excessive
    in the circumstances.”  Sun Life had claimed $538,334.83 inclusive of fees,
    disbursements and GST, and says its claim was
    “fair and reasonable.”  On the cross-appeal Sun Life asks for $300,000 plus
    GST for fees and $96,501.59 plus GST for disbursements.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    arriving at his decision with respect to the quantum of costs the trial judge
    made a substantial reduction from the Sun Life claim to reflect the access
    to justice and public interest factors in the case.  He said (at paras. 80-83
    and 85):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Based on the above considerations, I conclude that
    this is not an appropriate case to make no order as to costs but that Sun
    Life's claim for costs should be substantially reduced to reflect the presence
    of some public interest factors and to take into account the access to justice
    concerns of the <i>Class Proceedings Act, 1992</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I have exercised my discretion about costs governed
    by these considerations and by the factors set out in rule 57.01(1) of which
    just a few comments are necessary for me to complete my explanation for my
    decision that Sun Life should receive costs on a partial indemnity basis
    in the amount of $215,000.00 all inclusive of fees, disbursements and GST.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>That Sun Life should receive costs on a partial
    indemnity basis is justified by its success, by the principle of indemnity,
    and by its appropriate carriage and conduct of its own defence.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The amount of the costs of $215,000.00 all inclusive
    of fees, disbursements and GST is justified by the amount in issue in the
    litigation, the importance of the issues, the complexity of the proceedings,
    including the allegation that Sun Life should be liable for punitive damages,
    concerns about access to justice, particularly in class proceedings, and
    the principle that the costs of litigation should be reasonable and have
    regard to the reasonable expectations of the losing party.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Balancing all of the factors and not without difficulty,
    I have decided that the appropriate award of costs on a partial indemnity
    basis is $215,000 all inclusive. Practically speaking, this means the counsel
    fee awarded is about $100,000, which is a substantial reduction from both
    the amount actually expended and the $300,000 claimed and that takes into
    account the nature of the litigation, the access to justice concerns and
    the reasonable expectations of a losing party.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    conclusions reflect no error in principle and are fully justified on the
    record.  There is no basis for interfering with them.</p>
