  <h2>I.          Introduction</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    appeal involves a fraudulent preference and conveyance action commenced by
    the alleged creditor of a bankrupt with leave of the court under s. 38(1)
    of the <i>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3, as amended
    (the “Act”).  The court is required to consider whether the defendants named
    in the action have standing to challenge the s. 38(1) court order and the
    action commenced pursuant to that order, as well as the standing of the plaintiff
    to obtain relief under s. 38(1) and to maintain the action authorized thereunder. </p>
  <h2>II.        Relevant Statutory Provisions</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    following provisions of the Act are central to the issues on appeal:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>2.  In this Act,</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:
center;'>….</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>“creditor”
    means a person having a claim, unsecured, preferred by virtue of priority
      under section 136 or secured, provable as a claim under this Act;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:
center;'>….</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>38.     (1) Where a creditor requests the trustee
    to take any proceeding that in his opinion would be for the benefit of the
    estate of a bankrupt and the trustee refuses or neglects to take the proceeding,
    the creditor may obtain from the court an order authorizing him to take the
    proceeding in his own name and at his own expense and risk, on notice being
    given the other creditors of the contemplated proceeding, and on such other
    terms and conditions as the court may direct.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>          (2)  On an order under subsection (1)
    being made, the trustee shall assign and transfer to the creditor all his
    right, title and interest in the chose in action or subject-matter of the
    proceeding, including any document in support thereof.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:
center;'>….</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>121. (1)   All debts and liabilities, present or
    future, to which the bankrupt is subject on the day on which the bankrupt
    becomes bankrupt or to which the bankrupt may become subject before the bankrupt’s
    discharge by reason of any obligation incurred before the day on which the
    bankrupt becomes bankrupt shall be deemed to be claims provable in proceedings
    under this Act.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    parties also rely on the following remedial provisions of the Act: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>37.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Where
    the bankrupt or any of the creditors or any other person is aggrieved by
    any act or decision of the trustee, he may apply to the court and the court
    may confirm, reverse or modify the act or decision complained of and make
    such order in the premises as it thinks fit.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:
center'>….</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>187.(5) Every court may review, rescind or vary
    any order made by it under its bankruptcy jurisdiction.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center;'>….</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>  (9) No proceeding in bankruptcy shall be invalidated
    by any formal defect or by any irregularity, unless the court before which
    an objection is made to the proceeding is of opinion that substantial injustice
    has been caused by the defect or irregularity and that the injustice cannot
    be remedied by any order of that court.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>I will refer in these reasons to
    certain other provisions of the Act in the context of the issues to which
    they relate.</p>
  <h2>III.       Facts</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    dispute has a lengthy procedural history.  Given the submissions made by
    the appellants on appeal, a somewhat detailed chronology is necessary.    </p>
  <h2>(1)       Events Prior to Section 38 Motion</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the early 1990s, Herbert Graham Shaw (“Shaw”) operated two companies: Shaw
    Transportation Services (
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Thunder Bay) Limited (“Shaw Transportation”) and Shaw Baking Company Limited
    (“Shaw Baking”).  In 1993, when Shaw Transportation experienced financial
    difficulties, Shaw decided to access funds in two of his self-directed registered
    retirement savings plans (“RRSPs”) to pay some of Shaw Transportation’s debts.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    Shaw did not wish to diminish his retirement fund by collapsing his RRSPs,
    thereby triggering adverse income tax consequences.  He therefore persuaded
    his friend, the appellant Andre Nicol (“Nicol”), to arrange for the appellant,
    Nicol Island Development Incorporated (“
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Nicol
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Island”), to borrow funds from the RRSPs, to be secured by mortgages granted
    by
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">
    Nicol
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Island on lands owned by it in favour of the trustee of the RRSPs.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    June 17, 1993,
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Nicol
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Island borrowed $37,000 from the RRSPs, the repayment of which was secured
    by a mortgage in a like amount from
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Nicol
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Island to the trustee of the RRSPs and Nicol’s personal guarantee.  On July
    10, 1998,
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">
    Nicol
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Island borrowed an additional $55,000 from the RRSPs.  The repayment of this
    loan was again secured by a mortgage granted by
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Nicol
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Island in favour of the trustee of the RRSPs, in the same amount as the loan.  It
    appears that the proceeds of both loans were funnelled, directly or indirectly,
    to Shaw Transportation.  No payments were ever made on the Mortgages by any
    party.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    June 20, 2003, the respondent, Northern Lights Credit Union Limited (the “Credit
    Union”), commenced an action against Shaw and his wife, Carol Shaw, on their
    personal guarantee of Shaw Bakery’s indebtedness to the Credit Union (the “Guarantee
    Action”).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Five
    days later, on June 25, 2003, Shaw arranged for the discharge of the Mortgages,
    although the full amount of principal and interest owing thereunder remained
    outstanding (the “Discharges”).   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    August 18, 2003, when the Shaws did not defend the Guarantee Action, the
    Credit Union obtained default judgment against them in the amount of $109,748.58,
    plus postjudgment interest and costs.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    October 15, 2003, Shaw filed an assignment in bankruptcy under the Act.  The
    respondent, Ernst &amp; Young (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Thunder Bay) Inc., was appointed trustee of the bankrupt estate (the “Trustee”).  On
    October 17, 2003, the Trustee filed a notice of stay of proceedings against
    Shaw in the Superior Court of Justice, the effect of which was to preclude
    any efforts by the Credit Union to enforce its default judgment against Shaw,
    without leave of the court.  Consequently, at the end of October, the Credit
    Union filed a proof of claim in Shaw’s bankruptcy, in the amount of $108,863.28.  The
    proof of claim was accepted by the Trustee. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    his sworn statement of creditors and liabilities filed in the bankruptcy,
    Shaw listed the Credit Union as an unsecured creditor who was owed $108,200.  In
    his sworn statement of affairs (assets) in the bankruptcy, Shaw did not disclose
    the Mortgages or the Discharges.  Indeed, he indicated that his RRSPs had
    no value.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Neither
    Shaw (prior to his bankruptcy) nor his Trustee (after the bankruptcy) moved
    to set aside the Credit Union’s default judgment against Shaw.  However,
    after the default judgment against her was set aside in May 2004, Mrs. Shaw
    delivered a statement of defence and counterclaim in the Guarantee Action.  In
    her pleading, she challenged the validity of the guarantee granted to the
    Credit Union and claimed damages of approximately $5 million on her own behalf
    and that of her husband for wrongs allegedly committed by the Credit Union
    in realizing on its security against Shaw Bakery and the Shaws.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Shaw
    received an automatic discharge from bankruptcy on July 16, 2004.  It appears
    that his discharge was unopposed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When
    the Trustee subsequently learned of the Mortgages and the Discharges, it
    concluded that the Discharges constituted a wrongful settlement, fraudulent
    conveyance and/or preference without which the Mortgages would have formed
    part of the assets available in Shaw’s bankrupt estate to satisfy creditors.  Accordingly,
    on December 6, 2004, the Trustee moved in the bankruptcy proceeding for various
    relief against the appellants, including orders: setting aside the Discharges
    and reinstating the Mortgages; directing the appellants to pay the principal
    amounts owing under the Mortgages ($92,000) to the Trustee; and directing
    a trial of the issues raised on the motion (the “Trustee’s Motion”).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants countered with a cross-motion in which they sought an order dismissing
    the Trustee’s Motion in its entirety on the ground that it was frivolous
    and without merit or, in the alternative, dismissing it in respect of the
    1993 mortgage on the basis that the 10-year limitation period applicable
    to actions on a mortgage had expired, among other relief.  In their motion
    materials, the appellants alleged that the RRSP loans to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">
    Nicol
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Island were designed to assist Shaw in his financial difficulties, that the
    appellants derived no benefit therefrom, that the RRSP funds were provided
    to Shaw Transportation or its creditors at Shaw’s direction, and that the
    parties never intended that the appellants should be liable under the Mortgages.  </p>

    motions were heard together by Platana R.S.J. of the Superior Court of Justice.  On
    June 9, 2005, he dismissed the appellants’ motion, rejected or declined to
    rule on much of the relief claimed in the Trustee’s Motion, and ruled that
    there should be a trial on a number of the issues raised.  He therefore directed
    the parties to reattend before him to settle the issues for trial.  </p>

    various reasons, the directed reattendance before Platana R.S.J. did not
    take place for almost 18 months.  In the intervening period, by letters dated
    March 14, 2005 to Mrs. Shaw and January 9, 2006 to both Mr. and Mrs. Shaw,
    counsel for the Credit Union communicated directly with the Shaws regarding
    the possible settlement of the Guarantee Action.  In his January 9 letter,
    counsel indicated that his client had agreed
    “to accept your offer that the actions be dismissed on a without costs basis
    provided that you are responsible for the costs in taking out these Orders”.  On
    January 30, 2006, when payment of the required costs was not forthcoming,
    the Credit Union’s counsel informed the Shaws that the Credit Union would
    not take any further steps concerning the dismissal of the Guarantee Action.  </p>

    January 18, 2006, the Credit Union wrote to the Trustee and requested it
    to move forward with the litigation against the appellants.  The Trustee
    refused to do so as Shaw’s estate lacked sufficient funds to finance the
    litigation.  Instead, the Trustee informed the Credit Union that if it obtained
    an order under s. 38(1) of the Act permitting it to take the proceeding against
    the appellants in its own name, the Trustee would assign and transfer its
    interest in the proceeding to the Credit Union in accordance with s. 38(2)
    of the Act.</p>

    and indicated that it wished “to continue the proceedings commenced by the
    Trustee by arranging an appointment to settle the issues and obtain an order
    directing trial of those issues …”.  The Credit Union served its motion materials
    on the Trustee, but did not serve the appellants or Shaw.  </p>

    against the appellants in its own name, provided a procedure for so doing,
    and directed that the costs of the s. 38 motion were to be in the discretion
    of the court hearing the proceedings (the “s. 38 Order”).  Notice of the

    be tried.  Although the Trustee did not participate, its former counsel – T.
    Michael Strickland – appeared for the Credit Union.  By order dated December
    19, 2006, Platana R.S.J. directed in part that: (i) on consent, the matter
    was to proceed as a regular trial under the simplified procedure set out
    in the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>; and (ii) the issues to be tried were “as

    parties dispute certain of the events at the December 2006 court attendance.   In
    particular, in an affidavit filed on the motions that gave rise to this appeal,
    Strickland swore that, during this attendance, the appellants’ counsel raised
    the issue of the Credit Union’s status as a “proper creditor” of Shaw and,
    therefore, its entitlement to the s. 38 Order.  However, he also said that
    the appellants’ counsel did not “elaborate on why [the appellants] suspected
    that [the Credit Union] was not a proper creditor”, nor was it suggested
    that the appellants suspected that the Credit Union had released Shaw from
    any claims.  On the contrary, Strickland deposed that when he agreed to provide
    the appellants with a copy of the Credit Union’s proof of claim in bankruptcy,
    Platana R.S.J. asked the appellants’ counsel whether that information “would
    be sufficient”.  In response, counsel for the appellants allegedly “made
    no further objections and abandoned their argument” regarding the Credit
    Union’s status as a proper plaintiff. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants maintain that they did not abandon the creditor status issue during
    their appearance before Platana R.S.J.  They rely on affidavit evidence from
    Nicol that the appellants did not learn of the “settlement” of the Guarantee
    Action until February 2007.  But the appellants do not deny that the question
    of the Credit Union’s creditor status was raised before Platana R.S.J.  Nor
    have they adduced any evidence that contradicts Strickland’s version of what
    was said before Platana R.S.J. on this issue.</p>
  <h2>(4)       The Competing Motions</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    the end of January 2007, in reliance on the s. 38 Order, the Credit Union
    instituted a fresh action against the appellants, claiming essentially the
    same relief as had been sought on the Trustee’s Motion (the “s. 38 Action”).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants responded to the s. 38 Action in two ways.  First, in their statement
    of defence, they put in issue: (i) the Credit Union’s status as a creditor
    of Shaw and its standing to seek the s. 38 Order; (ii) the alleged settlement
    of the Credit Union’s claims against the Shaws; (iii) the validity of the
    Guarantee Action; and (iv) the Credit Union’s failure to disclose the alleged
    settlement to Platana R.S.J. and on the s. 38 motion.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Next,
    the appellants moved for orders dismissing the Trustee’s Motion and the s.&nbsp;38
    Action and setting aside the s. 38 Order, among other relief.  The stated
    grounds for the motion included claims that the Credit Union had no standing
    or capacity to initiate the s. 38 Action or to seek the s. 38 Order, that
    the s. 38 Order was obtained on the Credit Union’s false representation that
    it was a creditor of Shaw and without full and fair disclosure of all material
    facts, and that the s.&nbsp;38 Action was based on a request for the payment
    of a settled account.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    the appellants’ motion was brought under several rules of the <i>Rules of
    Civil Procedure</i>, it was framed principally as a motion to dismiss the
    s. 38 Action under subrules 21.01(3)(b) and (d) and as a motion for summary
    judgment under Rule 76 (the simplified procedure) or, in the alternative,
    under Rule 20.  Importantly, although the appellants sought to set aside
    the s. 38 Order under rule 59.06(2), they did not invoke the authority of
    the court under s. 187(5) of the Act to rescind or vary an order made in
    the bankruptcy or under s. 37 of the Act for relief against the Trustee concerning
    its assignment in favour of the Credit Union.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    its part, the Credit Union brought its own cross-motion for an order under
    rules 25.11 and 38.10 striking those paragraphs of the appellants’ pleading
    that dealt with the Credit Union’s creditor status, the alleged settlement
    with the Shaws, and alleged defects in the s. 38 motion, primarily on the
    basis that they raised issues unrelated to the issues ordered for trial.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>These
    competing motions proceeded before the Motion Judge.  By order dated December
    13, 2007, she dismissed the appellants’ motion and granted the relief sought
    by the Credit Union.  In the Motion Judge’s view: (i) the impugned paragraphs
    of the appellants’ pleading raised a new issue that was outside the scope
    of the issues to be tried under the Platana Order; (ii) no binding settlement
    was entered into by the Credit Union with Shaw – rather, the settlement discussions
    relied on by the appellants “could only have been with Carol Shaw”; (iii)
    the Credit Union was a creditor of Shaw at the time of his assignment in
    bankruptcy and, therefore, was eligible to seek an order under s. 38(1) of
    the Act; and (iv) the appellants’ challenge to the Credit Union’s creditor
    status constituted an impermissible collateral attack on the s. 38 Order.  </p>

    paras. 14-15, leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, [1994] S.C.C.A. No. 346,
    the Alberta Court of Appeal expressed the purpose of s. 38 in this fashion:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In my view, its primary purpose is to ensure that
    the bankrupt’s assets are preserved for the benefit of the creditors.  It
    provides the mechanism for creditors to proceed with an action when the trustee
    refuses or fails to act; thereby ensuring that assets of the bankrupt (which
    may otherwise go unrecovered) are available to creditors willing to finance
    the litigation.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The secondary purpose, relating to notice, is to
    make sure the section operates fairly.  While it is fair that those parties
    willing to accept the risks and costs of litigation receive a preference
    in terms of recovering their losses, the right to that preference must be
    shared with all creditors.</p>

    to be heard on a s. 38 motion.  This rule recognizes that so long as the
    s. 38 order in question merely authorizes the proceeding to be brought, the
    rights of the intended defendant will not be affected and no prejudice will
    be suffered: see <i>Formula Atlantic</i>, at para. 8; <i>Krupp</i>, at para.
    25.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    the courts have recognized certain limited exceptions to this general standing
    rule.  In <i>McCracken</i>, the British Columbia Court of Appeal held at
    paras. 9-10 that where an order under a predecessor version of s. 38(1) of
    the Act purported to impose on the intended defendant obligations in the
    conduct of the authorized litigation, directed the defendant to take specific
    steps in that litigation, or subjected the defendant to costs, the defendant
    had standing to move to vary the order in question.  Further, in <i>Formula
    Atlantic</i>, the same appellate court indicated at para. 13 that the general
    standing restriction will be displaced where necessary “to prevent [the court’s]
    process being used so as to perpetrate a fraud”.  There is also authority
    for the proposition that a defendant named in a s. 38(1) proceeding has standing
    under s. 187(5) of the Act to challenge the order authorizing the proceeding
    on the basis of alleged procedural irregularities: see <i>Jaston &amp; Co.</i></p>

    if a proposed or named defendant seeks to challenge the validity of a s.
    38 order, the appropriate practice is to bring an application for review
    under s. 187(5) of the Act.  To proceed otherwise – for example, by bringing
    a motion under the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i> as the appellants did
    here – will generally constitute an improper collateral attack on the s.
    38 order: see <i>Caisse Populaire Vanier Lt</i><i><span

    this case, relying on <i>Krupp</i> and <i>Formula Atlantic</i>, the Motion
    Judge held that the appellants’ challenge to the Credit Union’s creditor
    status was an impermissible collateral attack on the s. 38 Order.  The Motion
    Judge’s reasons do not suggest that this holding was based on the appellants’ failure
    to bring a variation motion under s. 187(5) of the Act.  Rather, the Motion
    Judge appears to have concluded that it was not open to the appellants to
    challenge the finding – implicit in the s. 38 Order – that the Credit Union
    was a creditor of Shaw.  For three reasons, I disagree.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    the appellants’ objection to the s. 38 Order rested on allegations of abuse
    of process, non-disclosure, procedural irregularities, fraud and misrepresentation
    to the court.  These serious claims triggered the exceptions to the restriction
    on standing that generally applies to challenges of s. 38 orders.  They required
    the scrutiny of the court to ensure that the administration of justice and
    the integrity of the bankruptcy process had not been undermined.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    there were two aspects to the appellants’ motion before the Motion Judge.  In
    addition to their request that the s. 38 Order be set aside, the appellants
    also sought summary judgment and dismissal of the s. 38 Action.  There was
    no restriction on the appellants’
    standing to seek the latter relief.  The Motion Judge was obliged to address
    both components of the appellants’
    motion.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> Finally,
    the costs provision of the s. 38 Order exposed the appellants to potential
    liability for the costs of the s. 38 motion.  The Credit Union accepts that
    the appellants had standing to seek to set aside this costs provision and,
    further, that it should be set aside.  I agree with this concession.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    recognize that the appellants did not invoke the remedial jurisdiction of
    the court under ss. 37 or 187(5) of the Act in their notice of motion filed
    with the Motion Judge.  It is unclear on this record whether they relied
    on these statutory provisions in their submissions before the Motion Judge – neither
    provision is mentioned in her reasons.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    the potential application of these provisions was fully argued before this
    court without objection by the Credit Union.  Indeed, on appeal, the Credit
    Union relied on s. 187(9) of the Act, although that provision was not cited
    by it in its cross-motion before the Motion Judge.  In these circumstances,
    I do not regard the appellants’ failure to explicitly ‘plead’ ss. 37 and
    187(5) of the Act as fatal to their standing to attack the s. 38 Order and
    the s. 38 Action. </p>
  <h2>            (3)       The Credit Union’s Standing </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    are three prerequisites to the invocation of s. 38(1): (i) the applicant
    for a s. 38 order must be a creditor of the bankrupt; (ii) the applicant
    must request the trustee in bankruptcy to take the proceeding that the applicant
    believes would be for the benefit of the estate of the bankrupt; and (iii)
    the trustee must refuse or neglect to take the requested proceeding.  Where
    these prerequisites are satisfied, the court, in the exercise of its discretion,
    may grant leave to the applicant to take the proposed proceeding in its own
    name and at its own expense and risk, subject to notice of the contemplated
    proceeding being given to the bankrupt’s other creditors.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Only
    the first prerequisite is at issue in this case.  The appellants argue that
    the Credit Union was not a creditor of Shaw at the time of his bankruptcy
    and when the s.&nbsp;38 Order was obtained, since the Credit Union had settled
    its claims against Mr. and Mrs. Shaw.  As a result, the appellants submit,
    the Credit Union had no standing to seek the s.&nbsp;38 Order or to commence
    the s. 38 Action.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Motion Judge disagreed.  She reasoned as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[28]     Firstly, Herbert Shaw did not obtain an
    order setting aside [the Credit Union’s] default judgment against him.  There
    was, therefore, no <i>lis</i> between the parties to settle.  The default
    judgment against Herbert Shaw was subsumed in his bankruptcy.  Mr. Shaw had
    no case to settle and no status to settle it, unlike his wife, Carol Shaw.  Despite
    the correspondence directed to both Herbert and Carol Shaw, I conclude that
    the settlement discussions could only have been with Carol Shaw.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center;'>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote> [30]    Secondly, s. 38 [of the Act] allows the
    Bankruptcy Court to authorize a creditor to stand in the shoes of the trustee
    when the trustee refuses to act. </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center;'>….</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[34]     I conclude that [the Credit Union], having
    been a creditor of Herbert Shaw upon his assignment in bankruptcy, was a
    creditor eligible to make a s. 38 application pursuant to the [Act], as it
    has done.  Even if a settlement subsequent to the bankruptcy were possible
    in law, it would be irrelevant to a s. 38 application.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, the Motion Judge did not err in holding that the Credit Union was
    a creditor of Shaw on the date of his bankruptcy.  It follows that she correctly
    concluded that the Credit Union was eligible to seek relief under s. 38(1)
    of the Act.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    word “creditor” is broadly defined under s. 2 of the Act as a person having
    a secured, unsecured or preferred claim “provable as a claim” under the Act.  Pursuant
    to s.&nbsp;121(1) of the Act, a debt or liability “to which the bankrupt
    is subject <i>on the day on which the bankrupt becomes bankrupt</i>” is deemed
    to be a claim “provable in proceedings under this Act” (emphasis added).  Thus,
    the date of bankruptcy is the relevant time at which to assess creditor status
    under the Act. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this case, when Shaw made his assignment in bankruptcy, the Credit Union
    had an outstanding default judgment against him.  In its capacity as a judgment-creditor,
    the Credit Union filed an unchallenged proof of claim in bankruptcy.  Shaw
    himself acknow-ledged the Credit Union’s status as one of his unpaid creditors
    in his sworn statement of creditors and liabilities, filed in the bankruptcy.  On
    these facts, as the debt owed by Shaw to the Credit Union was a debt to which
    Shaw was subject on the day on which he became bankrupt, the debt was deemed
    to be a claim provable in the bankruptcy proceeding by virtue of s. 121(1)
    of the Act.  Accordingly, as of that date, the Credit Union fit squarely
    within the definition of “creditor” under s. 2 of the Act.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants challenge both the sufficiency and the accuracy of the evidence
    of the Credit Union’s creditor status adduced on the s. 38 motion.  They
    contend that the Credit Union lost its creditor status prior to the date
    of and for the purpose of the s. 38 motion by entering into a final and binding
    settlement of its claims against Shaw.  The fact of that settlement, the
    appellants say, constituted an “acknowledge[ment]”,
    “recognition”, and “confirm[ation]” by the Credit Union that it had no claim
    against Shaw both at the time of bankruptcy and at the time of the s. 38
    motion.  I disagree.      </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    the purpose of a s. 38 motion, the court need only be satisfied on a balance
    of probabilities that the applicant is a creditor of the bankrupt: see <i>DeGroote
    v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce</i> (1996), 45 C.B.R. (3d) 132 (Ont.
    Gen. Div.), at para. 7, aff’d (1998), 37 O.R. (3d) 651 (

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this case, the Credit Union’s s. 38 motion was supported by an affidavit
    sworn by its Vice-President of Lending, B. Brian MacDonald.  In his affidavit,
    MacDonald set out the date of Shaw’s bankruptcy, the Credit Union’s request
    of the Trustee to proceed with the claim against the appellants, the Trustee’s
    refusal to do so, and the Trustee’s expressed willingness to assign its interest
    in the proceeding to the Credit Union.  He also swore that the Credit Union
    was a creditor of Shaw’s bankrupt estate.  Although the Credit Union’s proof
    of claim in bankruptcy did not form part of MacDonald’s affidavit, Shaw’s
    sworn statement of creditors and liabilities, in which he acknowledged the
    Credit Union as one of his unpaid creditors at the date of bankruptcy, was
    attached as an exhibit to the affidavit.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus,
    the MacDonald affidavit afforded some evidence that the Credit Union had
    a claim provable in Shaw’s bankruptcy, such that it was a creditor of Shaw.  Although
    not extensive, that evidence was sufficient to establish the Credit Union’s
    standing to bring a s. 38 motion.  The MacDonald affidavit also provided
    evidence that the other statutory prerequisites for relief under s. 38(1)
    had been satisfied.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants’ real complaint is that the Credit Union misrepresented its status
    as a creditor of Shaw on the s. 38 motion since the Credit Union had earlier
    settled its claims against Shaw.  In my opinion, on this record, this assertion
    is unsustainable.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    Shaw’s assignment in bankruptcy, all his property vested in the Trustee by
    operation of s. 71 of the Act.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a>  Further, under ss.&nbsp;30(1)(d), (h) and (i)
    of the Act, the Trustee became empowered to bring, institute or defend proceedings
    relating to Shaw’s property, to compromise and settle any debts owing to
    Shaw, and to compromise any claim made by or against Shaw’s estate.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[3]</span></span></span></a>  I therefore agree with the Motion Judge’s apt
    observation that, at the time of the alleged settlement, “Shaw had no case
    to settle and no status to settle it.”  Only the Trustee could conclude a
    settlement with a creditor of Shaw that was binding on Shaw’s bankrupt estate,
    as distinct from his wife.  This did not occur.  </p>

    importantly, Shaw was discharged from bankruptcy on July 16, 2004 – many
    months before the date of the March 2005 and January 2006 settlement correspondence.  By
    virtue of s. 178(2) of the Act,<a

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[4]</span></span></span></a> the effect of that discharge was to release Shaw
    from his debt to the Credit Union.  Consequently, at the time of the settlement
    correspondence, there was no debt owing from Shaw to the Credit Union that
    was susceptible to compromise.  Only the Credit Union’s claim against Mrs.
    Shaw continued.  It follows that the Credit Union did not forfeit its creditor
    status by entering into a binding post-bankruptcy settlement with Shaw.  </p>

    light of this conclusion, it is unnecessary to consider the Credit Union’s
    additional argument that since the Shaws failed to pay the costs of dismissing
    the Guarantee Action, no binding settlement was ever finalized with them.  The
    issue whether the Credit Union relinquished its claims against Mrs. Shaw,
    who is not a party to this appeal, remains to be determined in other proceedings – for
    example, in the outstanding Guarantee Action against Mrs. Shaw.  For the
    purpose of this appeal, the critical point is that no final and binding settlement
    was entered into with Shaw himself.</p>

    is in this context that the appellants’
    submission that the Motion Judge erred by holding that the evidence of the
    alleged settlement was “irrelevant to a s. 38 application” must be considered.  To
    the extent that this comment signified the Motion Judge’s conclusion that
    the settlement correspondence did not affect the Credit Union’s creditor
    status in Shaw’s bankruptcy, I agree.  </p>

    if this statement was intended to indicate that evidence of post-bankruptcy

    the purpose of a s. 38 order, I respectfully disagree.  I would not rule
    out the possibility that post-bankruptcy events may inform a s.&nbsp;38 creditor
    status review in a proper case.  For example, evidence confirming that a
    creditor’s claim was paid in full after the initial date of bankruptcy and
    before the date of a s.&nbsp;38 motion would clearly be relevant on a motion
    to rescind or vary a s.&nbsp;38 order subsequently granted to the creditor.  But

    regarding the Credit Union’s standing to bring the s. 38 motion; and (iii)

    had been accepted by the Trustee and evidence of its status as a creditor
    of Shaw on the day on which Shaw became bankrupt was adduced on the s. 38
    motion.  Further, the Credit Union’s status as a “creditor” of Shaw within
    the meaning of that term as defined under the Act had not been displaced
    by any post-bankruptcy event.  As a result, the Credit Union did not mislead

    with a s. 38 order is taking the action as if the creditor were the trustee.  As
    the Motion Judge indicated, once a s. 38 order is made, the creditor to whom
    it is granted stands in the shoes of the trustee: see for example, <i>Swerdlow</i>,

    the appellants claim that they did not learn of the alleged settlement until
    late February 2007, some two months after the date of the Platana Order,
    it was Strickland’s uncontradicted evidence that the issue whether the Credit
    Union was a proper creditor of Shaw was known to and raised by the appellants
    when the issues for trial were settled <i>on consent</i>.  It may therefore
    be expected that if the appellants intended to pursue this issue, some express
    mention of it would have been included in the agreed issues for trial.  This
    did not occur.</p>

    also note that the Credit Union provided the appellants with a copy of its
    proof of claim in bankruptcy and Shaw’s statement of creditors and liabilities
    in early January 2007.  With this information in hand, the appellants were
    positioned to move to vary the Platana Order when, on their evidence, they
    learned in February 2007 of the alleged settlement.  They failed to do so.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    the assertion that the s. 38 Order authorized only the continuation of the
    proceeding initiated by the Trustee, rather than the commencement of a new
    action by the Credit Union, does not assist the appellants.  Proceedings
    commenced under the authority of s. 38(1) of the Act are undertaken at the
    expense and risk of the moving party and, hence, are conducted in the name
    of the creditor who obtains the s. 38 order.  Furthermore, s. 38(1) contemplates
    the continuance of existing proceedings as well as the commencement of a
    new proceeding.  See Houlden, Morawetz and Sarra, at pp. 107 and 109.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this case, the s. 38 Action involves precisely the same issues as authorized
    for trial under the Platana Order.  There is no evidence of any prejudice
    to the appellants occasioned by the fact that the authorized s. 38(1) proceeding
    was initiated by way of a statement of claim delivered by the Credit Union
    in its own name.  Further, there is no evidence that the Trustee took any
    steps in respect of the matters authorized for trial under the Platana Order.  On
    the contrary, the Trustee, in effect, consented to the s. 38 Order by inviting
    the Credit Union to apply for it and by thereafter formally assigning its
    interest in the proceeding to the Credit Union.<a

    duplicative of the Trustee’s Motion, I agree with the appellants that the
    Trustee’s Motion should be stayed.  I did not understand the Credit Union
    to assert otherwise.</p>

    oral argument before this court, counsel for the appellants acknowledged
    that if the s. 38 Order is not set aside on the basis of the appellants’ creditor

    pleading must stand.  I agree.</p>

    these reasons, I would allow the appeal in part, by setting aside paragraph
    nine of the s. 38 Order – the costs provision
    – and staying the Trustee’s Motion.  In all other respects, I would dismiss
    the appeal.  As the respondent has been successful on the main issues before
    this court, it is entitled to its costs of the appeal on a partial indemnity
    basis, fixed in the total amount of $5,000, inclusive of disbursements and
    GST.  There is no basis on which to interfere with the Motion Judge’s costs
    award in the amount of $4,000 in favour of the respondent. </p>

    bankrupt is not a bar to a subsequent s. 38 motion: see <i>Gladstone v. Bronson

    of the late delivery of the Trustee’s assignment, this issue was wisely not
    pursued during oral argument.  The late delivery of the assignment was a
    procedural irregularity on the s. 38 motion, capable of being cured under
    s. 187(9) of the Act: see <i>Jaston
