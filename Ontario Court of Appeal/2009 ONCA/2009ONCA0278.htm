    trial judge found that the respondent Lychy breached a restrictive covenant
    in a partnership agreement by soliciting and accepting business from several
    partnership clients.  The covenant embraced the fiduciary duties the respondent
    owed to the appellants.  The restrictive covenant had a two year term.  The
    trial judge awarded the appellants damages measured by the earnings the appellants
    lost from the clients solicited for the two year period covered by the covenant,
    less 25% for the contingency that the clients would have left the appellants
    in any event.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants appeal the quantum of the damages, arguing that the trial judge
    erred by limiting the damages to the two year period and by deducting 25%
    for contingencies.  They submit that the damage award fails to reflect the
    full loss of their right to bar the respondent from competing for their clients
    for a two year period.  They say that loss included the opportunity to secure
    the loyalty of the clients and that as a “faithless fiduciary”, it does not
    lie in the respondent’s mouth to argue that they would have lost the clients
    in any event. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge was alive to the nature of the loss claimed by the appellants,
    namely, that “[a]s a fiduciary, Mr. Lychy was required to retire from the
    field of dealing with [clients] for a period of time to afford Reservoir
    a reasonable period in which to attempt to preserve the client relationship” (at
    para. 78).  He correctly observed that as the case involved a breach of fiduciary
    duty, the appellants had the option of claiming either:</p>
  <p><span
style='font-family:Times;'>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-family:Times;'>disgorgement
      of the benefit accruing to the respondent from his breach of duty, or</span></p>
  <p><span
style='font-family:Times;'>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-family:Times;'>recovery
      of the loss suffered as a result of the breach.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants elected to claim recovery of the loss. Having done so, it was
    for the appellants to prove the quantum of the loss, even though they sued
    for breach of fiduciary duty: <i>Martin v. Goldfarb</i> (1998), 41 O.R. (3d)
    161 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) at para. 67.  The appellants did not and could not satisfy that burden
    or somehow shift it to the respondent simply by proving a breach of fiduciary
    duty without also proving the loss suffered.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    quantification of the appellants’ loss was essentially a question of fact.
    The trial judge carefully assessed the evidence of what the appellants lost.  He
    found that there was no evidence and no rationale to support the appellants’ proposed
    use of a five-year period to measure the loss.  The fact that the clients
    had been with the appellants for an average period of five years did not
    prove that they would remain for five more years. The trial judge’s finding
    to the effect that the appellants offered no rational basis for the five
    year period was plainly a reasonable one, particularly in light of the balance
    of the evidence.  The appellants’ business, that of an insurance broker,
    operated in a highly competitive environment.  The clients were free to cancel
    their contracts on 30 to 90 days notice and pursue more advantageous arrangements
    elsewhere.  There was considerable evidence that several of the clients were
    unhappy with the service provided by the appellants following the respondent’s
    departure.  There was also considerable evidence that several of the clients
    were determined to retain the respondent’s services at the earliest possible
    opportunity. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    conclude that on this record, it was clearly open to the trial judge to conclude
    that even if the respondent had not solicited the clients and accepted their
    business, the clients would not have remained for five years and, indeed,
    that some or all of them likely would have left the appellants well within
    two years, a finding that justified a damage award aptly measured the lost
    earnings for the two year period, less 25%. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
style='color:#3A3A3A;letter-spacing:-.15pt'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    do not accept the submission that this damage assessment cannot be sustained
    in the face of a finding of breach of fiduciary duty.  As noted, the appellants
    elected to sue for the earnings they lost, not for disgorgement of the profits
    the respondent and his new employer gained.  As the contract embraced and
    shaped the fiduciary duty the respondent owed the appellants, the trial judge
    did not err in holding that in the circumstances of this case, the damages
    were the same in contract as for breach of fiduciary duty.  As La Forest
    J. stated in <i>Hodgkinson v. Simms</i>, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 377 at para. 94,
    where “[t]he relevant contractual duty breached by the respondent is of precisely
    the same nature as the equitable duty considered in the fiduciary analysis” the
    damages that flow from either breach are the same.  Nor do we agree that
    the damages awarded, measured by the loss the appellants suffered, were inadequate
    because they failed to punish the breach of fiduciary duty: see <i>Hodgkinson
    v. Simms</i>, at para. 81:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Equity is not so rigid as to be susceptible to
    being used as a vehicle for punishing defendants with harsh damage awards
    out of all proportion to their actual behaviour.  On the contrary, where
    the common law has developed a measured and just principle in response to
    a particular kind of wrong, equity is flexible enough to borrow from the
    common law.&nbsp; This approach is in accordance with the fusion of law and
    equity.&nbsp; Courts should strive to treat similar wrongs similarly, regardless
    of the particular cause or causes of action that may have been pleaded.&nbsp;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the appeal is dismissed.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>CROSS-APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent raised several issues on the cross-appeal but essentially relied
    upon his factum in that regard. We did not call on the appellants to respond
    to the cross-appeal.  In our view, there is no merit to the submission that
    the trial judge erred by failing to rule that the covenant was unreasonable
    given the nature of the appellants’
    business and the central role the respondent played in that business.  Nor
    do we see any merit in the submission that because some of the clients approached
    the respondent, he did not breach the covenant which precluded him from accepting
    as well as soliciting their business.  Finally, with respect to damages,
    the trial judge’s factual findings are supported by the evidence and there
    is no basis upon which we could or should interfere. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
