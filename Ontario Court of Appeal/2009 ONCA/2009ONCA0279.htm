    appellant, a beneficiary under a 1986 will, challenges the validity of the
    series of wills culminating in a will dated March 12, 2001 and a codicil
    dated September 17, 2001.  The challenged wills and codicil were executed
    over a three-year period between 1998 and 2001 by an elderly testatrix who
    died in 2004.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:100%'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant alleges that the impugned wills were invalid owing to a “presumption
    of undue influence” arising from the nature of the relationship between the
    testatrix and the respondent beneficiaries and executors: Lawrence Mailloux,
    the lawyer who drafted the wills; Dr. John Greenaway, the testatrix's doctor;
    and Vincent Moser, her accountant.  All of the respondents received substantial
    bequests under the challenged wills, Dr. Greenaway receiving more that $1
    million, about half the value of the entire estate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:100%'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    trial was ordered on the issue of the validity of the wills.  The respondents
    propounded the validity of the wills and brought a motion for summary judgment
    to dismiss the applicant’s challenge to their validity.  The appellant led
    no evidence on the motion, but argued that the matter could not be resolved
    summarily and that there were issues requiring a <i>viva voce</i> trial.  The
    motion judge concluded that there was no issue for trial and granted summary
    judgment. </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:100%'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rule
    75.06 (3)(d) of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i> provides that, on a motion
    for directions, the court may direct “procedures for bringing the matter
    before the court in a summary fashion, where appropriate”.  The appellant
    submits that as the order for directions in this case made no provision for
    summary disposition, and as this was not an “action” to which Rule 20 applies,
    the motion judge had no jurisdiction to entertain the motion for summary
    judgment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:100%'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    would have been preferable had the respondents moved to amend the original
    order for directions to provide for summary disposition.  However, it is
    equally true that if the appellant intended to insist that, without an amendment
    to the order, the court could not deal with the motion for summary judgment,
    she should have taken appropriate and timely steps to object to the procedure.  However,
    when served with the motion for summary judgment, the appellant fully participated
    in the proceedings by cross-examining the respondents’ witnesses. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:100%'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    am not persuaded that the respondents’ failure to have the order for directions
    amended deprived the court of jurisdiction to grant summary judgment.  The
    rules contemplate the possibility of summary disposition in contentious estate
    matters, and in the circumstances of this case, the failure to amend the
    order amounts to nothing more that a procedural defect that caused no prejudice
    to the appellant.</p>

    see no error on the part of the motion judge in concluding that there was
    no triable issue raised by the appellant to challenge the wills.  Mailloux,
    the lawyer who drew the will, swore that he advised the testatrix to get
    independent legal advice but that she refused to do so.  Mailloux died before
    he was cross-examined on his affidavit and the motion judge ruled his affidavit
    to be admissible based on necessity and reliability.  Dr. Greenaway swore
    that the testatrix was of sound mind and that he did not attempt in any way
    to influence the manner in which she disposed of her estate. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:100%'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents compiled a substantial record of evidence to support their contention
    that the wills were properly executed, that the testatrix was of sound mind,
    and that she fully understood the contents of the wills and how her property
    was to be disposed of on her death.  The respondents led affidavit evidence
    from several of the testatrix’s caregivers and another doctor who saw the
    testatrix several times in the absence of Dr. Greenaway.  This evidence painted
    a consistent picture of the testatrix as being mentally alert, competent,
    and a person who knew exactly what she wanted.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:100%'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant led no evidence on the motion to dispute any of these facts. The
    appellant submitted, however, that as the respondents were the testatrix’s
    lawyer, doctor and accountant, and as they all received substantial bequests
    under the challenged wills, the circumstances are inherently
    “suspicious” and that a trial is therefore required. The appellant also submits
    that admissibility of Mailloux’s evidence should be tested on a <i>viva voce</i> hearing. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:100%'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant points to evidence that Dr. Greenaway, acting under a power of
    attorney during the testatrix’s lifetime, had invested a substantial sum
    of her money in his own name on her behalf and that he engaged in a transaction
    with one of the testatrix’s caregivers apparently designed to conceal earned
    income as a gift.  The appellant submits that these transactions are questionable
    and that they put Dr Greenaway’s credibility in issue and that a <i>viva
    voce</i> hearing is therefore required. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:100%'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge carefully considered all the available evidence.  He found that
    while it would have been preferable for Mailloux to have declined to take
    instructions that led to a bequest in his favour, this did not affect the
    validity of the will.  In this regard, I would observe that Mailloux willingly
    acted on the testatrix’s instructions which resulted in a reduction in the
    bequest he was to receive.  In any event, I do not agree that the determination
    of the legal issue of the admissibility of his evidence would benefit from
    a <i>viva voce</i> trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:100%'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Greenaway explained the impugned investment transaction.  The testatrix was
    reluctant to invest her money in anything other than secure, interest-bearing
    instruments, and he paid her an appropriate rate on the money he invested.  The
    motion judge observed that Dr. Greenaway had made full disclosure of this
    transaction on the passing of accounts.  With respect to the other transaction
    involving the payments to the caregiver, the motion judge found that Dr.
    Greenaway had simply tried to assist the testatrix and her caregiver. </p>

      motion judge concluded that there was an absence of evidence of suspicious
      circumstances and no triable issue as to the validity of the will.  I see
      no error in the reasons of the motion judge that would justify the intervention
      of this court.  The respondents gave detailed explanations of the circumstances
      the appellant contends are “suspicious” and, significantly, the appellant
      offered no evidence to the contrary.  In the absence of any evidence to
      challenge the substantial body of evidence led by the respondents to support
      the validity of the will, I see no basis for concluding that the motion
      judge erred in concluding that there remained no triable issue and that
      it was appropriate to award summary</span> judgment declaring the impugned
      will to be valid.</p>
