    Corporation which was incorporated under the

    <st1:State

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The plaintiffs’ primary claim is based on the
    oppression remedy under s. 248 of the <i>OBCA</i>.
    They allege that the defendants conducted the affairs of Mascan in a manner
    that was oppressive and unfairly prejudicial to the security holders and seek a
    broad range of remedies aimed at rectifying the harm caused by the defendants’
    allegedly oppressive actions.</p>

    judge dismissed the motion.  McLaughlin
    filed a notice of appeal to this court.  He
    now seeks a direction as to whether the appeal lies to this court or to the
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court.
    McLaughlin submits that the appeal is to this court. However, if I do not
    agree, he asks that I make an order transferring the appeal to the
    <st1:Street

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I have concluded that this appeal lies to the

    judge is a final order. I agree. An order that conclusively disposes of an
    issue raised by way of defence and thereby deprives a defendant of a
    substantive right is a final order: <i>Ball
    v. Donais</i> (1993), 13 O.R. (3d) 322 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ). Thus, an order dismissing a
    motion to plead matters in defence has been held to be a final order: see <i>385925 Ontario Ltd. v. American Life Insurance</i> (1985), 51 O.R. (2d) 382 (H.C.). In this case, by way of example, Cumming J.’s
    order refused McLaughlin’s request to plead that the plaintiffs’ claims should
    be dismissed because they do not have clean hands or because they were acting
    pursuant to an illegal conspiracy. The effect of the order is to finally
    determine that those defences are not available to McLaughlin.</p>

    1990, C.43 describes this court’s jurisdiction to hear appeals from a final
    order of a Superior Court judge:  </p>
  <p>6.(1)  An appeal lies to the Court of Appeal from,</p>
  <p>…</p>
  <p class=MsoNormal>(b)  a final order of a judge of the Superior

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>An appeal lies
    to the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">

style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus, the issue on this motion is whether the motion
    judge’s order is “an order made… under this Act” within the meaning of s. 255
    of the <i>OBCA</i>. I conclude that it is.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I start by observing that the <i>OBCA</i> does not contain provisions
    governing many of the procedures that apply generally to civil actions in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario. Like other
    civil actions, claims brought pursuant to the <i>OBCA</i> are subject to the <i>Rules
    of Civil Procedure</i>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194. Some of those rules deal with
    purely interlocutory matters. Others, such as Rule 20 (summary judgment), Rule
    21 (inadequate pleading) and certain other motions related to pleadings may
    finally determine an action or issues within an action.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In this case, McLaughlin’s motion to amend was
    brought pursuant to Rule 26.01. That being the case, McLaughlin argues that the
    order dismissing his motion was not made “under this Act” within the meaning of
    s. 255 of the <i>OBCA</i>. Rather, it was
    made under the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>.
    On that narrow interpretation of s. 255, unless an order is expressly
    authorized by the language of the <i>OBCA</i>,
    then even if it finally resolves the action or an issue within the action, the
    order is not considered to have been made under the <i>OBCA</i>. In such a case, the argument goes, s. 255 does not apply, and
    the route of appeal is governed by the <i>Courts
    of Justice Act</i>. Appeals of final orders would go to the Court of Appeal and
    interlocutory orders to the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">

    Divisional
    Court with leave.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In support of this submission, McLaughlin relies
    on the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in <i>Kelvin Energy v. Lee</i>, [1992] 3 S.C.R. 235, a case which is, in my
    view, distinguishable. In the <i>Kelvin </i>case,
    Kelvin Energy brought an application for an oppression remedy under the <i>Canada Business Corporations Act</i>, R.S.C.
    1985, c. C-44 (“<i>CBCA</i>”). The parties
    negotiated a settlement which, pursuant to the <i>CBCA</i>, had to be approved by the court. The Director under the <i>CBCA</i>, who was added as a party to the
    proceedings, obtained a court order to examine two witnesses. That order was
    made under the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Quebec <i>Code of Civil Procedure</i>, R.S.Q., c.
    C-25, whose rules expressly apply in oppression proceedings under the <i>CBCA</i>. The order for discovery was
    appealed and the Director moved to quash the appeal on the ground that the
    order was not appealable as of right under s. 249 of the <i>CBCA</i>.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The wording of s. 249 of the <i>CBCA</i> is similar to s. 255 of the <i>OBCA</i>. It provides that an “appeal <span
class=verdana>lies to the court of appeal of a province from any final order
    made by a court of that province under this Act.” </span>Thus, the issue in <i>Kelvin </i>was whether the order for
    discovery under the Civil Code was an “order made by a court… under this Act”. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Supreme Court held that it was not. Writing
    for the majority, L’Heureux-Dubé J. held that the question as to whether an
    order is made under the Act must be approached by examining the “legislative
    origins of the power from which the judgment is derived”: <i>Kelvin</i> at p. 251. At p. 253-54, she stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Although the
    respondent was authorized to examine Atkinson and Sharpe in the general context
    of an application for the approval of a settlement, this interlocutory judgment
    does not thereby become an order made under the <i>Canada Business Corporations Act</i>. The relationship between the
    power which is in fact exercised and the legislative source must, in my opinion,
    be much closer for s. 249 C.B.C.A. to apply<i>.</i> <span style='letter-spacing:-.15pt'>For example, if the trial judge had
    approved or rejected the proposed settlement, this would have been an order
    which, under s.&nbsp;242(2) <i>C.B.C.A.</i>, derived its source from a power
    specifically conferred by the <i>Canada Business Corporations Act</i>.&nbsp; On
    the other hand, saying that an examination authorized to collect information on
    discovery is no different for the purposes of an appeal from an order provided
    for in the provision in question amounts to confusing means and ends.&nbsp;</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Unlike <i>Kelvin</i>,
    the order in this case was not an interlocutory order but a final order
    disposing of potential defences in an oppression action. In my view, the
    relationship between the power exercised by the motion judge was sufficiently
    “close” to a legislative source under the <i>OBCA</i>,
    namely, the power to adjudicate on oppression claims under s. 248. Implicit in that
    power is the authority to allow or deny certain claims and defences. When a
    court allows or dismisses an application under s. 248 after the completion of
    the proceedings, it is making an order under the <i>OBCA</i> which is appealable to the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court under s. 255. In my
    view, when a court exercises what is, in effect, the same power by allowing or
    dismissing a claim or a defence brought under s. 248 at an early stage of the
    proceeding, it is equally making an order “under this Act”. The relationship
    between the power in fact exercised – dismissing a defence to the claim – is
    sufficiently “close” to the source of the legislative power under s. 248.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Furthermore, as Laskin J.A. noted in <i>Amaranth L.L.C. v. Counsel Corporation</i> (2004), 71 O.R. (3d) 258 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    )
    at para. 10, the result in <i>Kelvin</i> “was driven by an important policy consideration”: to interpret the appeal
    provision in the C.B.C.A. in a way that was consistent with its purpose and
    with the purpose of the Act as a whole. Thus, in <i>Kelvin</i>,<i> </i>L’Heureux-Dubé J.
    held that<i> </i>allowing appeals as of
    right from an “almost unlimited number of interlocutory judgments that may be
    rendered in the course of a proceeding… would be contrary to the legislature’s
    primary objective of providing a fast and effective remedy to protect
    shareholders vulnerable to oppression”: <i>Kelvin</i> at p. 258. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The interpretation of s. 255 of the <i>OBCA </i>that I adopt provides for a single
    appeal route for orders that finally resolve issues in an oppression action
    brought under the <i>OBCA</i>. Thus,
    interpreting s. 255 so as to include the order granted in this case is
    consistent with the purpose of s. 248 which, like its <i>CBCA</i> counterpart, provides a fast and effective remedy to protect
    vulnerable shareholders.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This interpretation of s. 255 makes a good deal
    of common sense. In <i>Amaranth</i>, Laskin
    J.A. held at para. 12:</p>
  <p>[I]t would be an anomalous result
    if the issue of standing were to be hived off and appealable only to this
    court, while the underlying merits of the s. 255 proceedings were appealable to
    the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Equally, it
    would be an anomalous result if orders finally determining issues, obtained
    prior to the completion of the full hearing of the merits of the case, were
    appealable to the Court of Appeal while, if determined after the hearing, decisions
    on same issues and the underlying merits of the case were appealable to the
    Divisional Court.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There is one other aspect of this case that
    deserves comment. The plaintiffs’ claim is based primarily on s. 248 of the <i>OBCA</i>. However, the plaintiffs make an
    alternative claim for breach of fiduciary duty. On this motion, the parties did
    not suggest that s. 255 was inapplicable because the alternative claim was not
    made under the <i>OBCA</i>. Indeed, the main
    plaintiff, the Ontario Securities Commission, pleads its authority to make the
    oppression claim under s. 248 of the <i>OBCA</i>.  It has not plead that it is making a claim in
    any other capacity.  In these
    circumstances, I do not think that the presence of the alternative fiduciary
    duty claim alters the appeal route.</p>

line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As I said at the outset, the order under appeal
    in this case is a final order that resolves a proposed issue in the oppression
    action. The same reason that the order is considered to be a final order is the
    reason why, in my view, it ought to be considered as “an order made… under this
    Act” for the purposes of s. 255.</p>
