    way of a brief overview, the charges upon which the appellant was convicted
    are historical in nature. They date back to the late 1970s and early 1980s
    when the complainants were members of the Venturers, a Scouts Canada group,
    and the appellant was their leader. Venturers were aged 14 to 17. The incidents
    giving rise to the various offences against the complainants are alleged
    to have occurred while E.R. and D.G. were within that approximate age range.
    By the time of trial, E.R. was 41 years old and D.G. was 40. </p>
  <h4 align=left style='text-align:left;line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>The
      Verdict in Relation to E.R.</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    incidents described by E.R. took a similar pattern. The appellants job regularly
    required him to take day trips out of town and he acknowledged that he took
    E.R. with him on such trips more than once. Although the appellant could
    not confirm how many times he had done so, E.R. testified that he had accompanied
    the appellant on 15 or 20 of these trips. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According
    to E.R., on one of those trips, the appellant drove to a turnaround kind
    of area located between the town of
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    Paris, where he and the appellant lived, and the town of
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    St. George. The appellant parked the car and, after chatting briefly with
    E.R., began kissing E.R.s cheek and neck and fondling E.R. This was followed
    by the appellant performing oral sex on E.R. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According
    to E.R., incidents of a similar nature occurred at the same location on approximately
    ten occasions. The appellant would fondle E.R.s penis on the outside and
    inside of his clothing and then perform oral sex on E.R. In return, the appellant
    would take E.R.s hand and make E.R. fondle the appellant. On a couple of
    occasions, E.R. recalled the appellant grabbing E.R.s head and pulling it
    toward the appellants penis, following which E.R. was required to perform
    oral sex on him. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal;'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>E.R.
    explained that he continued going out of town with the appellant after the
    first and second incidents because he believed that the appellant would not
    persist in these activities. As for the balance of the occasions, E.R. said
    he could not answer why he continued to go  he just didnt know. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    and around 2000, E.R. decided to disclose the secret that he had kept buried  deep
    as possible inside to his wife. He then confronted the appellant, with whom
    he had maintained a friendship in the ensuing years. Eventually, in February
    2002, E.R. informed the police and provided a video-taped statement on February
    26, 2002. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    cross-examination, E.R. rejected the suggestion that he was motivated to
    falsely accuse the appellant to obtain a civil award for damages. He also
    denied that the appellants close friendship with S.R., E.R.s brother, and
    the fact that the appellant refused to sever that friendship in favour of
    E.R. after being told of a falling out between the brothers over their fathers
    estate, were factors that motivated his accusations against the appellant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pausing
    here, I note that S.R., who in his adult years had formed a close relationship
    with the appellant, also complained to the police in 2002 about an incident
    in which the appellant took him for a drive into the country after a Venturers meeting
    and attempted, unsuccessfully, to kiss him. While the jury acquitted the
    appellant on that count, the nature and extent of the alleged abuse differed
    considerably from the multiple incidents of abuse described by E.R. and the
    single incident described by D.G., which I address below. Specifically, the
    incident described by S.R. involved an
    attempted kiss, which S.R. resisted by getting out of the car. Nothing
    further occurred. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Returning
    to E.R., the appellant testified and acknowledged that he had taken E.R.
    out of town on a number of day trips, but he denied any sexual impropriety.
    He also raised the spectre that E.R. had falsely accused him because E.R.
    was angry with him for failing to cut his ties with S.R.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    of this was before the jury; so too was the apparent inconsistency in E.R.s
    evidence about which the appellant makes much in support of his unreasonable
    verdict claim. The inconsistency is found in a statement that E.R. wrote
    out at home after first speaking to the police, in which he stated that he [did]
    not ever recall performing oral sex on [the appellant]. As indicated, at
    trial, E.R. mentioned several occasions in which he had in fact performed
    oral sex on the appellant. </p>

line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>E.R.
    was not asked in cross-examination or re-examination to explain the apparent
    inconsistency. However, the jury was provided with his written statement
    to the police as an exhibit. In it, as noted, E.R. used the words I do not
    ever recall to describe whether he had ever performed oral sex on the appellant,
    not the words it never happened. Moreover, the jury had E.R.s comment,
    in the same statement, that he would
    turn off my brain during the incidents, as well as his testimony that he
    had
    buried [the incident] deep inside him.</p>

    his charge, the trial judge referred to the apparent inconsistency in E.R.s
    recitation of the evidence. He also summarized the appellants position on
    it as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The theory of
    the defence is that E.R.s evidence is completely discredited by a host of
    factors including that of a prior inconsistent statement on a hugely significant
    issue, whether he ever performed oral sex on [the appellant].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant makes no complaint about the propriety of the trial judges instructions.  Indeed,
    he concedes that the charge was error-free.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the circumstances, I see no basis for setting the jurys verdict aside as
    unreasonable. Based on my review of the evidence, it is clear that this is
    a verdict that a properly instructed jury acting judicially, could reasonably
    have rendered: <i>R. v. Yebes</i>, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 168, at p. 185. There
    was nothing particularly bizarre or out of the ordinary about E.R.s allegations.
    There was nothing about them that would raise red flags. Nor was there anything
    untoward about the reason for E.R.s late disclosure or the circumstances
    surrounding it. The appellants suggestions concerning E.R.s motives for
    falsely accusing him are, in my view, far-fetched. In any event, they were
    left to the jury to consider. </p>

    she leave the home and go away [with the kids] for the weekend. At most,
    she may have left for a few hours in the daytime, but, no, never were we

    Chatham, when in fact, his wifes mother lived just down the street. He further
    points to the fact that because his daughter participated in the bicycle

    to

line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    argument, must, in my view, be rejected. In so concluding, I consider it
    significant that the appellants wife was not asked whether she and the children
    had ever made an overnight trip to her sisters house in
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Chatham, or elsewhere, on a Friday night before her daughter was scheduled
    to participate in the bicycle rodeo. Nor was the appellant asked about this.
    Surely, that would have been an obvious question, with an equally obvious
    answer, if indeed it was family practice to remain in town on the night before
    the rodeo. The failure of the appellant and his wife to give that evidence  or
    to be asked about it  is something that would not have been lost on the
    jury, especially as it stood in stark contrast to the wifes definitive recollection
    about her whereabouts on the Friday night before the rodeo in May 1980 when
    the family home was for sale.</p>

    come from the appellant. As D.G. testified: I dont know exactly where they
    were. I am pretty sure they were in

    observations arise from this. First, the appellant did not say that his wife
    and children would never go out of town on a Friday night before the rodeo;
    nor, as I have pointed out, did his wife say that. Second, the appellants
    challenge to D.G.s evidence rested primarily on his mother-in-laws place
    of residence and the fact that she lived two doors down the street from him.
    In assessing his testimony, the jury may well have taken from his evidence
    in-chief that his wife would have had no reason to be in

    that, in assessing the reasonableness of the jurys verdict, I note that
    this was a straightforward case and one which the jury was uniquely capable
    of deciding. D.G.s allegations were not bizarre or out of the ordinary.
    They were limited to one occasion. Manifestly, there was no attempt on his
    part to guild the lily; nor is it suggested that his testimony was tainted
    by outside sources or the product of collusion. Indeed, the event he described
    was quite different, in time and place, from the events described by E.R.
    and S.R. Moreover, as the record reveals, D.G. stood up well under cross-examination
    and no significant inroads were made into his testimony.</p>

line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My
    colleague makes much of the fact that on a common sense view of the evidence, it
    would seem unlikely that a mother would take her six to eight year old daughter
    away on a Friday night, after a day in school, driving for several hours
    from Paris to Chatham to visit a relative, only to turn around and make
    the same lengthy trip the following morning so that her daughter could participate
    that morning or afternoon in what was
    undoubtedly a major event for the child.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect, while the logic of my colleagues
    unlikely to happen scenario cannot be denied, there are evidentiary gaps
    that render it speculative. For example, there is no evidence that the daughter
    attended school on the Friday before the rodeo; she may have had the day
    off. Nor is there evidence as to the time she was scheduled to participate
    in the rodeo. It may have been 3 oclock in the afternoon, in which case,
    a several hour drive from
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Chatham would have posed no problem. The family could have left
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Chatham at 8:00 a.m. and been in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">

line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Most
    importantly, as I have already observed, the unlikely to happen scenario
    could have been addressed by the wife when she testified. She was the one,
    not D.G., who could have given specific evidence about the two possible Friday
    nights in question, or at the very least, attested to an inviolable family
    rule of never leaving town on the night before a rodeo in which one of the
    children was participating. Had she given that evidence, the verdict might
    have been different. She did not and in my respectful view, it is speculative
    to conclude that in the absence of such evidence, no reasonable jury properly
    instructed could have rejected the appellants testimony and accepted D.G.s
    testimony beyond a reasonable doubt. I hasten to point out that my observations
    about the missing evidence should not be construed as somehow placing a burden
    on the appellant to prove his innocence. They are simply meant to address
    my colleagues primary reason for concluding that the jurys verdict in regard
    to D.G. is unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All
    in all, I am satisfied that the jurys verdict in relation to D.G. was reasonable;
    at least I have not been persuaded otherwise. In so concluding, I note that
    where a jurys verdict is challenged as being unreasonable, more than a lurking
    doubt is required to warrant appellate intervention. As the Supreme Court
    of Canada observed in <i>R. v. Biniaris, </i>[2000] 1 S.C.R. 381, at para.
    38:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>The exercise
    of appellate review is considerably more difficult when the court of appeal
    is required to determine the alleged unreasonableness of a verdict reached
    by a jury  <i>It is insufficient for the court of appeal to refer to a vague
    unease, or a lingering or lurking doubt based on its own review of the evidence</i>.
    This lurking doubt may be a powerful trigger for thorough appellate scrutiny
    of the evidence, <i>but it is not, without further articulation of the basis
    for such doubt, a proper basis upon which to interfere with the findings
    of a jury</i>. In other words, if, after reviewing the evidence at the end
    of an error-free trial which led to a conviction, the appeal court judge
    is left with a lurking doubt or feeling of unease, that doubt, <i>which is
    not in itself sufficient to justify interfering with the conviction</i>,
    may be a useful signal that the verdict was indeed reached in a non-judicial
    manner. In that case, the court of appeal must proceed further with its analysis.

    I recognize that jury findings are to be afforded great deference on appeal,
    without question. However, where an unreasonable verdict is alleged, the
    court must nonetheless conduct an independent re-examination of the evidence
    and to some extent re-weigh the evidence and consider its effect to determine
    whether the jury arrived at such a verdict: see <em>R. v.
    Yebes</em>, at p. 186; <em>R.
    v. Biniaris</em>. The court must then determine whether, on the facts that were
    before the trier of fact, a jury properly instructed and acting reasonably
    could convict: <em>R. v. Burke</em>, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 474, at paras. 4-7 &ndash; or
    to put it in the negative, whether a properly instructed jury that did not
    have a reasonable doubt on the facts before it could be said to have been
    acting reasonably and judicially. In this regard, I note the comment of Carthy
    J.A. in <em>R. v. Francois</em> (1993), 14 O.R. (3d) 191, 82 C.C.C. (3d) 441 (C.A.)

    oldest child would have been 6, 7 and 8 years old and in early grade school
    at the time.  She not only participated in the Saturday bike rodeo in each
    of those years, she won a prize in 1978 and 1979.  Her participation, and
    that she won a prize, is confirmed by articles from the local
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City

    Paris newspaper, filed as exhibits.  This, too, is uncontested.  She participated

    term
    weekend, as used by the appellant and his wife in their testimony, may
    not include Friday night.  However, neither the appellant nor his wife was

    defies common sense.</p>

    that a mother would take her 6 to 8 year old daughter away on a Friday night,
    after a day in school, driving for several hours from Paris to Chatham to
    visit a relative, and then making the same lengthy return trip the following
    morning so that her daughter could participate that morning or afternoon
    in what was undoubtedly a major event in the childs life at that time. </p>

    that is essentially the basis upon which my colleague concludes the defence
    evidence does not hold up and reconciles that evidence with the jurys
    verdict of guilty.  He says the appellant and the defence witnesses were
    not asked the obvious specific question: whether his wife had ever made an
    overnight trip to her sisters house in
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    testimony of the appellants wife is not open to any interpretation other
    than that the answer to such a question would have been no, at least with
    respect to 1980.  She says she was at home all the time during that spring.  It
    is true that her testimony was confined to meeting the allegation with respect
    to that year.  It is also true that a jury has a right to disbelieve a witness.  However,
    I can discern no basis upon which to found such disbelief here.  She was
    not cross-examined.  There was no contradictory evidence.  That leaves 1978
    and 1979.</p>

    evidence of the newspaper reports.  For reasons articulated above, it is
    highly improbable in the ordinary course of events that the appellants wife

    I have outlined above, when assessing an argument of unreasonable verdict,
    an appellate court must determine whether the jury could reasonably have
    reached the conclusion that the accused is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt: <i>W.

    my colleagues analysis runs the risk of turning that principle on its head
    and shifting the onus to the appellant to satisfy the jury that his wife
    and children would never go out of town, anywhere, on a Friday night before
    the rodeo.  There is no basis in the record for suggesting that she went
    anywhere other than
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Chatham at the time of the incident.  For the reasons I have outlined  given
    the uncontested participation of the appellants 6 to 8 year old daughter
    in the Saturday bike rodeo the following day  I regard it as unreasonable
    for the jury not to have had a reasonable doubt regarding the appellants
    guilt on the count relating to D.G.</p>

    sister lived in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Chatham.  An evasive answer is one that does not respond to the question
    asked.  As noted above, D.G.s evidence was unequivocal that the appellants
    wife was at her mothers in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Chatham, and the appellant answered the questions put to him.  I do not think
    the lens of judicial experience referred to in <i>Biniaris</i> requires
    the court to ignore the practice that generally clients are advised by their
    counsel only to answer the questions asked of them in cross-examination.</p>

    not a case where I am left only with a lurking doubt, insufficient in itself
    to justify interfering with the findings of the jury.  Rather, it is a case
    where an initial vague unease or lurking doubt provides a powerful trigger
    for thorough appellate scrutiny.  That appellate scrutiny leads me to conclude,
    in the circumstances of this case, that the verdict is unreasonable and cannot

    grounds.  He was persuaded that the verdict crossed the Rubicon into that
    territory only because he felt a quick verdict following a late jury question
    about whether the accused needed to testify signalled that the jury improperly
    relied on the accuseds failure to do so.  The Court of Appeal decision was
