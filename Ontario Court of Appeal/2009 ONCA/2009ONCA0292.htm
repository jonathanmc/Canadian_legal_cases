  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    the court’s decision in this matter was rendered, A.C. Concrete advised the
    court that, through inadvertence, the record before the motion judge and
    this court was incomplete and inaccurate.  It asks the court to accept a
    corrected record and reconsider whether to permit that part of its claim
    based on alleged misuse of the Industry Fund to proceed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    inaccuracies in the record relate to the proceedings before the Board in
    respect of the unfair labour practice complaint brought by A.C. Concrete
    against the Association.  The record shows that, with leave, A.C. Concrete
    withdrew the complaint in its entirety.  What the record fails to show is
    that prior to withdrawal, the Board issued two interim decisions and struck
    those parts of the complaint that related to the alleged misuse of the Industry
    Fund.  Neither of the Board’s interim decisions was in the record or brought
    to the attention of the courts.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Board’s first interim decision is dated June 27, 2005.  In it, the Board
    noted that A.C. Concrete alleged that the Association had violated ss. 141
    and 167(2) of the Act.  It expressed concern about its jurisdiction over
    certain aspects of the complaint relating to the fees collected by the Association
    and the manner in which the Association spent its resources.  At para. 8,
    the Board said:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In the context of section 74 applications, the
    Board has always said that it does not have the jurisdiction to adjudicate
    disputes arising from the internal workings of a trade union.  Similarly
    here, it appears that the manner in which an association functions and the
    relationship of that functioning to the objects of the association are within
    the jurisdiction of the Superior Court of Justice, not the Board.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Board then directed A.C. Concrete to make written submissions on the matter
    and gave the Association an opportunity to respond to such submissions.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further
    submissions were made to the Board.  Neither the complaint nor the further
    submissions made any reference to s. 143 of the Act.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Board rendered its second interim decision on November 17, 2005.  In it,
    at para. 5, the Board stated that it would not inquire into the alleged misallocation
    of the Industry Fund.  It struck paras. 18 to 28 of the complaint, saying
    that the alleged facts did not engage “any of the provisions” of the Act.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Neither
    party sought a reconsideration or judicial review of the Board’s interim
    decisions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents agree that the record is incomplete and the court should receive
    the two interim Board decisions.  They oppose a reconsideration by the court.  They
    say that because s. 143 was not raised with the Board, there is no Board
    decision on the scope of its jurisdiction under s. 143.  Consequently, they
    say, A.C. Concrete is free to return to the Board for a determination of
    its allegations relating to the misuse of the Industry Fund, pursuant to
    s. 143 of the Act.  They contend that A.C. Concrete can place the matter
    before the Board in one of two ways.  First, relying on s. 143 of the Act,
    A.C. Concrete could ask the Board to reconsider its decision to strike those
    parts of its complaint which relate to the alleged misuse of the Industry
    Fund.  Second, they say that A.C. Concrete could file a fresh complaint,
    based on s. 143, restricted to the alleged misuse of the Industry Fund.  Counsel
    for the respondents undertook to make no argument before the Board based
    on issue estoppel, should A.C. Concrete so proceed.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would not accede to A.C. Concrete’s request that this court undertake a reconsideration.  As
    s. 143 of the Act was never raised in the proceedings before the Board, despite
    the broad wording in para. 5 of the second interim decision, I do not view
    the Board as having decided any issues arising out of s. 143, including the
    matter of its jurisdiction.  Consequently, I accept the respondents’
    submission that A.C. Concrete may return to the Board for a consideration
    of its allegation that the Association has violated s. 143 of the Act.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the question of the scope of the Board’s jurisdiction pursuant to
    s. 143 is best decided, in the first instance, by the Board.  It is a specialised
    tribunal with acknowledged expertise and experience in a dynamic, complex
    and sensitive field:  see, for example, <i>Cuddy Chicks Ltd. v.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario (Labour Relations Board)</i>, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 5, at para. 14; <i>Royal
    Oak Mines Inc. v.
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    (Labour Relations Board)</i>, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 369, at para. 57; and <i>International
    Longshoremen’s and Warehousemen’s Union, Ship and Dock Foremen, Local 514
    v. Prince Rupert Grain Ltd</i>., [1996] 2 S.C.R. 432, at para. 24.  Pursuant
    to s. 114(1) of the Act, the Board has exclusive jurisdiction to determine
    all questions of fact or law that arise in any matter before it.  Curial
    deference is to be shown its decisions, including those determining the scope
    of its jurisdiction pursuant to its enabling legislation: see <i>Cuddy Chicks,
    supra, </i>at para. 14.  Deference to the Board dictates that it be afforded,
    in the first instance, an opportunity to opine on the scope of its jurisdiction
    under s. 143.  Furthermore, this would ensure that a reviewing court, if
    any, would have the benefit of both a complete and accurate record and the
    Board’s reasoning when considering the matter.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    be clear, nothing in this court’s decision should be taken to preclude the
    Board and a reviewing court, if any, from considering afresh the scope of
    the Board’s jurisdiction pursuant to s. 143 of the Act.  In light of the
    incomplete record, the comments of this court in relation to s. 143 are not
    determinative.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    parties quite properly submit that, in the circumstances, no order as to
    costs should be made in respect of the request for reconsideration by this
    court.  I agree.  Consequently, I would make no order as to costs of this
    matter.  </p>
