    September 8, 2008, Hambly J. heard two motions in this family law proceeding.  Carol
    Ann Owers (“Ms. Owers”) brought a motion in which she asked the court to
    implement the order of Taylor J. dated August 16, 2007 (the “Justice Taylor
    order”).  The Justice Taylor order was based on a consent to mediation-arbitration
    agreement, dated August 13, 2007, that the parties had entered into through
    their counsel.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the purposes of this appeal, para. 3 of the Justice Taylor order is the key
    provision.  It requires that all aspects of the matters in dispute between
    the parties, except their divorce, are to be resolved by means of binding
    mediation-arbitration.  Paragraph 3 reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This case shall be removed from the Ontario Superior
    Court of Justice and sent to binding mediation-arbitration with Terrence
    W. Caskie as (binding) Mediator-Arbitrator, with respect to all outstanding
    issues between the parties (including division of property, the matrimonial
    home in Chapala Mexico, equalization, and the costs of the mediation-arbitration).  The
    Mediator-Arbitrator shall have exclusive jurisdiction over the Chapala,
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Mexico</st1:country-region>
    home and contents (ownership, possession and sale).  The costs of the Mediation-Arbitration
    shall be funded equally by the Husband and Wife to its conclusion, subject
    to adjustment or re-allocation by the Mediator-Arbitrator.  Any award or
    interim award of the Mediator-Arbitrator shall be made an order of this Court,
    on consent, upon Form 14B Motion by either party.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the other motion, Bruce Alfred Owers (“Dr. Owers”) sought a stay of all proceedings
    in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario, including the mediation-arbitration.  Dr. Owers brought the motion,
    in part, because of delays in proceeding with the mediation-arbitration,
    which he saw as totally attributable to Ms. Owers and her lawyer (not Mr.
    Epstein).  Given his age (72), health problems and other personal considerations,
    he wanted the matters in dispute to be resolved expeditiously and effectively.  He
    was of the view that this could be accomplished only through the proceedings
    that Ms. Owers had commenced in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Mexico</st1:country-region>
    .</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    order dated September 16, 2008, the motions judge dismissed Ms. Owers’ motion,
    granted Dr. Owers’ motion and ordered a stay of these proceedings (the “Order”).<a href="#_ftn1"

    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario, the motions judge stated that there was no need to set aside the
    Justice Taylor order
    “since the application in which it was granted is stayed”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Owers appeals.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, we would allow the appeal and order that the matter
    proceed to mediation-arbitration in accordance with the Justice Taylor order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No
    purpose can be served by setting out the tortured legal history of these
    proceedings, which include numerous forays into the Mexican and
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario courts.  In our view, the starting point for resolving this appeal
    is whether the motions judge erred by failing to deal with the Justice Taylor
    order before considering the request for a stay of proceedings here in Ontario.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, he did so err.  As a court order, the Justice Taylor order stands
    and is binding, unless it is set aside or lawfully quashed: see <i>Wilson
    v. R.</i>, [1983] 2 S.C.R. 594, at 599.  Granting a stay of these proceedings
    without first determining whether the Justice Taylor order should be set
    aside amounted to an impermissible collateral attack on that order.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    the question becomes: ought the Justice Taylor order to be set aside?  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    primary argument advanced for setting it aside is that the consent on which
    it is based was signed, not by the parties, but by counsel for the parties.  This,
    it is argued, contravenes the requirements of the <i>Family Law Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3 (the “
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>FLA</i>”).  Amendments to the <i>FLA </i>in 2006 are such that when read
    with the <i>Arbitration Act, 1991</i>, S.O. 1991, c. 17, a “family arbitration
    agreement” must now be in writing, signed by the parties and witnessed, in
    order to be enforceable.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    would not give effect to this argument.  In <i>Geropoulos v. Geropoulos</i> (1982),
    35 O.R. (2d) 763 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), this court considered a situation very similar to that of the present
    case.  At the time that <i>Geropoulos </i>was decided, s. 54(1) of the <i>Family
    Law Reform Act</i>, R.S.O. 1980, c. 152, provided that a domestic contract
    was “void unless made in writing and signed by the persons to be bound”.  The
    settlement agreement in question had been executed by counsel for the parties,
    rather than the parties themselves.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Robins
    J.A., writing on behalf of the court, held that settlement agreements concluded
    by counsel which resolved outstanding claims in pending litigation were beyond
    the purview of s. 54(1).  Accordingly, he found the settlement agreement
    to be binding.  His reasoning can be found at p. 769:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my opinion, the section plainly is not aimed
    at or intended to apply to authorized settlement agreements like the present,
    made with legal advice during the pendency of court proceedings which, to
    be effective, require the intervention of the court.  Such agreements derive
    their effect from an act of the court; their authenticity is assured by the
    court’s supervision and control over them; and ample protection is afforded
    the parties to these agreements, wholly independent of the section.  The
    court’s jurisdiction to enforce settlements or refuse to do so, notwithstanding
    any agreement between solicitors or counsel, is well established …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>No purpose is to be served in compelling agreements
    of this kind to comply with the formalities of s. 54(1) and, if not, permitting
    parties to withdraw at will from compromises properly entered into by their
    legal representatives before trial of their action or … compromises concluded
    even during the trial of the action. It may well be that, given the nature
    of matrimonial litigation, prudence would dictate that lawyers ensure that
    settlement agreements are signed by the parties personally and witnessed.  But
    I cannot construe the section as requiring that an otherwise valid compromise
    of an action must be rendered void and defeated on this ground alone, nor
    do I believe that the legislation could have contemplated or intended that
    result.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the reasoning in <i>Geropoulos </i>is equally applicable in the
    present case.  No purpose would be served by interpreting the legislation
    in a way that would permit parties to withdraw at will from agreements properly
    entered into by their legal representatives during the course of litigation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    said that, we understand that s. 59.6(1) of the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <i>FLA</i><i> </i>imposes additional requirements related to the enforceability
    of family arbitration awards and the agreements on which they are based.  Under
    s. 59.6(1)(a), a family arbitration agreement on which an award is based
    must be made in writing and must comply with regulations made under the <i>Arbitration
    Act, supra</i>.  O.Reg. 134/07, enacted under the <i>Arbitration Act, supra</i>,
    provides certain requirements for family arbitration agreements and mediation-arbitration
    agreements made on or after September 1, 2007.   (It will be noted that the
    mediation-arbitration agreement and the Justice Taylor order were made prior
    to that date.)  Nothing in these reasons is intended to speak to whether
    the signatures of counsel alone are sufficient to render enforceable family
    arbitration agreements made after that date.       </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for Dr. Owers offers a second reason for setting aside the Justice Taylor
    order.  That order was based on the consent to mediation-arbitration agreement
    and the consent was entered into without disclosure by Ms. Owers that she
    had commenced family law proceedings in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Mexico</st1:country-region>
    .  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    would decline to set aside the Justice Taylor order on this basis.  Should
    Dr. Owers wish to pursue the matter, he can raise it with the mediator-arbitrator,
    Mr. Caskie, in whom the parties have entrusted all substantive and procedural
    matters necessary to resolve to their dispute (except for the divorce). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    the extent that Dr. Owers asks the court to set aside the Justice Taylor
    order because of the delays caused by Ms. Owers and/or her counsel to the
    mediation-arbitration process, we decline to do so for two reasons.  The
    first reason is that Mr. Epstein, counsel for Ms. Owers on this appeal, gave
    two undertakings to the court should the appeal be allowed.  The first such
    undertaking is that Ms. Owers would, within thirty days, file with the Mexican
    courts a consent stating that she agrees to the filing with and enforcement,
    through the Mexican courts, of any court order flowing from the mediation-arbitration
    process.  He candidly stated that the appeal should be dismissed should the
    consent not be filed within that time.  The second undertaking given by appeal
    counsel for Ms. Owers is that no further action would be taken in the Mexican
    proceedings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second reason for not giving effect to this ground of appeal is that Mr.
    Caskie has the ability to deal with a lack of co-operation by either party.  We
    are confident that he can handle any attempts to further delay the mediation-arbitration.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    disposed of the appeal on the basis of the validity of the Justice Taylor
    order, it becomes unnecessary to decide the other issues raised by the parties.   </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>DISPOSITION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    subject to para. 21 below, the appeal is allowed and paras. 1 and 2 of the
    Order are set aside.  The companion costs order dated October 30, 2008, in
    which costs of the motions were awarded to Dr. Owers, is set aside as well.  Ms.
    Owers’ motion to implement the Justice Taylor order is granted.  We direct
    Mr. Caskie to proceed with the mediation-arbitration forthwith and order
    the parties to take all steps necessary to facilitate that process.  Apparently
    there is or may be some disagreement about what regulations govern the mediation-arbitration.  In
    the circumstances of this case, we are of the view that Mr. Caskie is bound
    by the regulations that governed arbitrations at the time he was appointed
    mediator-arbitrator.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Our
    disposition of this appeal is predicated, in part, on the undertakings given
    by appeal counsel for Ms. Owers, described above in para. 17.  This panel
    of the court will remain seized of this matter and if the undertaking to
    file a consent with the Mexican courts is not complied with, Dr. Owers is
    at liberty to return and ask that the appeal be dismissed.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Costs
    of the appeal are ordered in favour of Ms. Owers, fixed in the amount of
    $10,000, inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.  If counsel are unable to
    agree on costs of the motions below, they may make brief written submissions
    on the matter, such submissions not to exceed three pages in length, which
    are to be filed with the court within thirty days of the date of release
    of these reasons.  The time frame for filing costs submissions has been chosen
    to coincide with the undertaking to file a consent with the Mexican courts.</p>
