    $418,732.00 damages for wrongful dismissal.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent was a senior executive with the appellants CDI Career Development
    Institutes Ltd.  CDI was acquired by the appellant Corinthian Colleges Inc.
    in August 2003.  The parties attempted to negotiate new terms of employment
    for the respondent but failed to reach an agreement.  The respondent was
    terminated without cause on September 11, 2003.  The respondent sued the
    appellants for breach of contract, wrongful dismissal and ancillary relief.  The
    respondent claimed that the employment agreement he signed in 1994, as amended
    in writing in 1997, was no longer in effect – it having been replaced by
    a new oral agreement reached in July 2003 or in the alternative, in accordance
    with the Common Law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants’ position was that the respondent continued to be bound by the
    1994 agreement as amended.  The trial judge agreed with the appellants’ position
    finding that the 1994 agreement as amended was still in effect and generally
    governed the termination.  The termination clause in the 1994 agreement as
    amended required the appellants to pay the respondent severance of 12 months
    salary.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    assessing damages, the trial judge gave a generous interpretation to the
    term salary and accepted that the respondent was entitled to receive payments
    for several items not specified in the agreement.  The most significant of
    these being a retention bonus of $165,000 that he found had been agreed to
    between the parties in pre-acquisition discussions. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants argue that the trial judge erred in two respects.  First, they
    claim that action ought to have been dismissed in its entirety because the
    respondent did not, in his pleadings, make any claim under the 1994 contract
    as amended and in fact, had taken the position that it had been replaced
    or cancelled.  Second, they submit that the trial judge erred in his interpretation
    of the 1994 agreement as amended and in not limiting the respondent’s recovery
    to what is specifically provided for in the text of the 1994 agreement as
    amended in 1997.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not agree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    to the first issue, the respondent’s pleading was sufficiently broad so as
    to encompass the findings made by the trial judge.  The appellants cannot
    argue that they were taken by surprise given that the trial judge in effect
    accepted their submission that the termination was governed by the 1994 agreement
    as amended.  It is only the trial judge’s interpretation and application
    of that agreement and his findings that oral amendments or additions had
    been agreed to that the appellants disagree with.  By the time of trial,
    the respondent’s alternative position on the 1994 agreement as amended was
    known to the appellants and squarely before the court.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning
    to the second issue raised, with one exception, I see no basis for interfering
    with the trial judge’s award.  There was ample evidence from which the trial
    judge could conclude that the parties had agreed that the respondent would
    be paid a retention bonus of $165,000 in the event that the respondent stayed
    through the merger and did not resign for one year after the merger.  When
    the appellants terminated the respondent without cause, this bonus became
    due and owing.  The factual record also amply supports the other elements
    of the trial judge’s damage award.  Specifically, there was evidence that:</p>
  <p>a)         the appellants had agreed to pay the respondent $1000 a month
    more in remuneration as a result of the appellants having discontinued the
    respondent’s car allowance;</p>
  <p>b)         the bonus provision as set out in the 1994 agreement as amended
    had been varied over the years, albeit not in writing, and did not preclude
    bonus payments for part years if targets were being met.  Additionally, bonus
    was now a significant component of the respondent’s remuneration and therefore,
    was properly considered to be salary for purposes of severance entitlement;</p>
  <p>c)         CDI’s policy requiring employees to use or lose their vacations
    was not really enforced and that the respondent did not take all of his holidays
    in prior years; and</p>
  <p>d)         the remuneration provided by CDI now included the employer matching
    employee RRSP contributions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    also see no basis to interfere with the trial judge’s conclusion that during
    the 12 months pay in lieu of notice period, the appellants had to provide
    the respondent with medical and dental benefits.  In my view, however, the
    trial judge erred in requiring that the appellants reimburse the respondent
    for $5,123 in expenses he incurred in his efforts to mitigate his damages.  The
    agreement provided for payment in lieu of notice regardless of whether the
    respondent mitigated.  In these circumstances, there was no basis for the
    trial judge’s award of the expenses.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, I would allow the appeal with respect to the trial judge’s award
    of $5,123 in mitigation expenses and in all other respects, I would dismiss
    the appeal with costs to the respondent on a partial indemnity scale fixed
    at $19,000 inclusive of GST and disbursements.</p>
