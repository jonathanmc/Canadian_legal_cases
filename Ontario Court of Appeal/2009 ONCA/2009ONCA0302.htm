'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant is a lawyer. Around 1994, she became
    involved in a romantic relationship with a Mr. Condo. The appellant also developed
    a friendly relationship with Mr. Condo’s then wife, Ms. McGuire, who knew about
    her husband’s ongoing relationship with the appellant. The three remained involved
    in this unusual domestic relationship for about five years. The relationship
    provides the backdrop for the events that unfolded and the subsequent police
    investigation and charges against the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In April 1999, the relationship between Mr. Condo and
    his wife began to unravel. A series of events occurred during April and May
    1999, that culminated in Mr. Condo being charged and eventually convicted of
    various serious criminal offences, including criminal harassment, kidnapping
    and assault causing bodily harm against Ms. McGuire. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On June 4, 1999,
    Detective Pasanen served an information on the appellant for the purpose of
    obtaining a peace bond against her under s. 810 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46 in relation to Ms. McGuire. The
    Crown later withdrew this information on June 25, 1999. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On September 2,
    1999, Detective Monette arrested the appellant for criminal harassment of Ms. McGuire. The appellant was briefly detained in custody before being released
    on conditions. Although jointly charged with Mr. Condo, the appellant obtained
    a severance and, ultimately was discharged at the preliminary inquiry. Assistant
    Crown attorney McGarry had carriage of this prosecution.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant’s
    three actions against the various respondents were heard together. Following a
    twenty-three day trial, Brennan J. dismissed the appellant's claims. Among other
    findings, the trial judge held:</p>
  <blockquote>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>The decision to proceed with a s. 810  peace bond information was a reasonable and balanced decision made after

    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>Mr. McGarry directed Detective Monette to obtain a warrant for the
      appellant’s arrest so she could be released on conditions. The appellant was to
      be arrested at the courthouse so she could be processed immediately. Although that
      did not occur because she did not attend court  as expected, she was detained for only a couple of hours at the police
      station and was released on terms substantially as intended. </span></p>
    <p><span style='font-size:13.0pt;

      and, in the light of his other findings, the trial judge declined to draw an
      inference of malice.</span></p>
  </blockquote>
  <p><b><span style='font-size:13.0pt;'>III. Discussion</span></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant
    raises numerous issues on appeal including: insufficiency of reasons,
    improper admission of evidence, misapprehension of evidence, and misstatement
    and misapplication of the applicable legal tests, including the test for
    negligent investigation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We would not give effect to the appellant’s grounds of
    appeal. At their core, the issues
    raised call into question the reasonableness of the trial judge’s findings of
    fact. In our view, there was admissible evidence at trial capable of supporting
    the trial judge’s core findings. Viewed in this context, even if the legal test
    for negligent investigation relied on by the trial judge has been superseded by <i>Hill v. Hamilton-Wentworth Regional
    Police Services Board</i>, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 129, the trial judge’s finding that
    the police officers acted reasonably in the circumstances supports his decision
    to dismiss the actions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addressing
    the question of the reasonableness of the trial judge’s findings, it is not necessary
    that we determine whether the trial judge improperly relied on the appellant’s
    involvement in various small claims court proceedings against Ms. McGuire. Nor
    is it necessary that we determine whether the trial judge improperly relied on
    evidence of telephone calls made to Ms. McGuire from the appellant’s telephone
    number. Even leaving aside the evidence relating to these matters, there was sufficient
    admissible evidence at trial to support the trial judge’s core conclusions. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In particular,
    there was evidence at trial indicating that as of the date the s. 810 information
    was served on the appellant (June 4, 1999), the police had information from Ms.
    McGuire’s lawyer that Ms. McGuire feared the appellant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, the
    police had information that the appellant attended at Ms. McGuire’s office on
    May 28, 1999 with Mr. Condo’s two children and waited in a waiting room while Mr.
    Condo’s 9-year-old daughter gave Ms. McGuire a copy of an interim custody order<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a> and asked Ms. McGuire to write a note giving permission for the children to
    leave the Ottawa-Carleton Region with their father and the appellant. As of May
    28, 1999, Mr. Condo had been charged with criminal harassment of Ms. McGuire
    and he was subject to a recognizance prohibiting him from communicating with the
    appellant “for the purpose of transmitting any form of communication on behalf
    of Richard Condo.”  In other words, Mr.
    Condo was specifically prohibited from using the appellant as a conduit for
    communication with Ms. McGuire.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Particularly in
    light of the ages of the children, the only reasonable inference arising from the
    May 28, 1999 incident is that the appellant took the children to Ms. McGuire’s
    office to facilitate Mr. Condo’s use of the children as a means of
    communicating with Ms. McGuire contrary to the terms of his recognizance. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view,
    this evidence was sufficient to support the trial judge’s conclusion concerning
    the decision to lay the s. 810 information. The fact that Ms. McGuire obtained
    a non-communication order against the appellant in the matrimonial proceedings
    between Ms. McGuire and Mr. Condo on June 4, 1999, the same day that the s. 810
    information was served, does not detract from this conclusion. Mr. Condo
    kidnapped and assaulted Ms. McGuire on May 31, 1999. In the face of these
    events and the May 28, 1999 incident, the police were justified in seeking an
    order under the <i>Criminal Code</i> and any
    failure on their part to make inquiries about or consider the status of the
    civil proceedings does not reflect on the adequacy of the police investigation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, at the
    time the criminal harassment charge was laid against the appellant, the police
    were also aware of a letter from Mr. Condo that was delivered to Ms. McGuire by
    a female on May 5, 1999. As of May 5, 1999, Mr. Condo was subject to a
    recognizance that prohibited him from communicating directly or indirectly with
    Ms. McGuire except through his lawyer. The appellant does not dispute the fact that
    she delivered the letter but argues that the police did not have evidence that
    she delivered it when the criminal harassment charge was laid and therefore
    were not entitled to rely on this incident as a basis for the charge. We do not
    accept this submission. Given the history between these parties, it was
    reasonable for the police to infer that the appellant had delivered the letter
    and that the appellant “at the very least was a party to this ongoing
    harassment by facilitation.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The fact that Ms. McGuire did not give evidence at the
    preliminary inquiry indicating that she was afraid of the appellant does not
    detract from the trial judge’s conclusions. Ms. McGuire did not testify at the
    civil trial. It was open to the trial judge to draw an inference, as he did,
    that Ms. McGuire was afraid of the appellant based on the whole of the evidence
    at the civil trial and in the context of the unusual domestic relationship
    between the three individuals. In any event, the trial judge’s decision to
    dismiss the actions was premised, at least in part, on a finding that the
    appellant was a party to Mr. Condo’s harassment of Ms. McGuire. Accordingly, a
    finding that Ms. McGuire was afraid of the appellant was not essential to the

    sufficient to explain the basis of his decision and to permit appellate review.
    The fact that the trial judge could have weighed the evidence differently or
    made different findings of credibility does not undermine his findings. </p>

    demonstrated a reversible error of law.<span style='font-size:12.0pt'> </span></p>
