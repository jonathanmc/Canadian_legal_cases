  <h3>I. Overview</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This appeal raises once again the scope of insurance coverage
    under the OPCF 44R – Family Protection Coverage Endorsement (OPCF 44R Endorsement)
    that relates to bodily injury caused by an inadequately insured motorist and is
    contained in the standard automobile insurance policy in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario.  In two recently decided cases, <i>Citadel
    General Assurance Co. v. Vytlingam</i>, [2007] 3 S.C.R. 373, and <i>Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co. v. Herbison</i>,
    [2007] 3 S.C.R. 393, the Supreme Court of Canada determined the limits of insurance
    coverage available to persons seeking to make claims involving uninsured or
    unidentified persons under ss. 239 (1) and 265 of the <i>Insurance Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. I-8, and inadequately insured
    persons under the OPCF 44R Endorsement.  The
    sole question on appeal is whether these decisions dictate finding that the
    appellants’ insurance claim falls outside the scope of coverage provided by the
    OPCF 44R Endorsement.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant, Louise Russo, was the unfortunate victim
    of a drive-by shooting in which she sustained spine injuries that rendered her
    paraplegic.  She brought an action
    against the unidentified the driver of the car and against The Personal/La
    Personnelle (the respondent), her own automobile insurer, pursuant to the OPCF
    44R Endorsement.<i>  </i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent delivered a Statement of Defence,
    claiming that Ms. Russo’s injuries did not result “directly or indirectly from
    the ownership, use or operation” of an automobile, as required by the OPCF 44R
    Endorsement, but rather from an intervening independent act – the shooting.  Relying on the Supreme Court’s decisions in <i>Vytlingam</i> and <i>Lumbermens</i>, the respondent brought a motion<i> </i>for summary judgment for the determination before trial of a
    question of law – the interpretation of the limits of liability insurance
    coverage under the OPCF 44R Endorsement.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge allowed the respondent’s motion and
    granted summary judgment in its favour, thereby dismissing Ms. Russo’s claim
    against the respondent for insurance coverage in respect of the damages she
    suffered.  The motion judge found that the
    Supreme Court had settled the law with respect to the limits of liability under
    the OPCF 44R Endorsement and that Ms. Russo’s claim was outside the scope those
    limits. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants appeal to this court from the decision
    of the motion judge.  For the reasons
    that follow, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h3>II. Facts</h3>
  <p class=SubheadingItalics><strong>The Drive-By Shooting, Ms. Russo’s Injuries, and the
    Commencement of the Action</strong></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On April 21, 2004, Ms. Russo drove into the parking lot
    of a California Sandwiches restaurant and parked her car, leaving the engine
    running and her daughter in the car while she went into the restaurant to get a
    snack.  Without warning, bullets were shot
    into the restaurant while Ms. Russo was inside.  A bullet fragment hit her spine, seriously injuring her and rendering
    her paraplegic.  The assailants had fired
    the shots from a stolen van as it was driving by in the parking lot.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The police investigation later determined that the
    assailants had intended to kill Michael Modica, another patron who was seated at
    the back of the restaurant.  The
    assailants mistook four innocent men standing in the front of the restaurant
    for Modica and his associates.  Mark Peretz,
    who was later identified as the driver of the van, drove towards the front of
    the restaurant and his two passengers, Antonio Borrelli and Paris Christoforou,
    opened fire using a Colt semiautomatic rifle and a handgun.  The four innocent men took cover and Ms.
    Russo was the only person hit by any of the bullets.  The assailants then fled the parking lot in
    the van driven by Peretz.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since the identities of the assailants were initially
    unknown, Ms. Russo and the other appellants, who are members of her family,
    commenced an action against John Doe, Jane Doe, and the respondent.  Ms. Russo’s claim against the respondent was
    based on ss. 239(1)(a) and 265(1)(a) of the <i>Insurance
    Act</i> and s. 3 of the OPCF 44R Endorsement.  </p>
  <p class=SubheadingItalics><strong>The Relevant Statutory
    Provisions</strong></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 239(1)(a) of the <i>Insurance Act</i> requires all automobile insurance policies to insure the
    policy-holder against the liability of
    other tortfeasors for loss or damage “arising from the
    ownership or <i>directly</i> or <i>indirectly</i> from the use or operation” of
    an automobile (emphasis added).  Section 265(1)(a)
    of the <i>Insurance Act </i>requires every
    automobile liability insurance policy to provide for recovery of damages for
    bodily injury from the owner or driver of an uninsured automobile or from an unidentified
    driver.  The OPCF 44R Endorsement, which tracks
    the language used in s. 239(1)(a), “backstops” <br>
    s. 239(1)(a) in cases where the contribution of the tortfeasor’s own insurer
    (if any) is inadequate: see <i>Vytlingam </i>at
    para. 7.  It provides that the policy-holder’s
    own insurer will indemnify him or her “for the amount that he or she is <i>legally entitled to recover</i> from an
    inadequately insured motorist…in respect of bodily injury…arising <i>directly</i> or <i>indirectly</i> from the use or operation of an automobile” (emphasis
    added).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The effect of these provisions, read together, is that
    the subsequent identification of the assailants does not affect the legal issue
    to be determined, because it is not contested that Peretz, the driver of the
    van, is inadequately insured.  Accordingly, whether or not the respondent is required to compensate Ms.
    Russo for her damages depends on the proper interpretation of the OPCF 44R
    Endorsement.</p>
  <h3>III. Reasons and Disposition of the Motion Judge</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I note that although the motion judge focused her
    analysis on the scope of insurance coverage provided for in s. 239(1)(a) of the <i>Insurance Act</i>, it is implicit that
    her analysis applies to the limits of insurance coverage under the OPCF 44R
    Endorsement, which tracks the language of s. 239(1)(a), the sole issue in this
    case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge accepted the respondent’s position and
    concluded that, as was the shooting in <i>Lumbermens</i> and the rock throwing in <i>Vytlingam</i>,
    the shooting in this case was an independent act that broke the chain of
    causation linking the use of van and Ms. Russo’s damages.  Consequently, Ms. Russo’s injuries did not
    arise “directly or indirectly from the use or operation” of the assailants’
    vehicle as required for entitlement to insurance coverage under the OPCF 44R
    Endorsement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In reaching this conclusion, the motion judge considered
    both whether the assailants’ use of the van at the time of the incident was an
    ordinary and well-known use thereof (the purpose test) and, if so, whether a
    causal connection existed between Ms. Russo’s injuries and the ownership, use,
    or operation of the van (the causation test).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In applying the purpose test, the motion judge accepted
    that an ordinary and expected use of an automobile is to transport persons to
    and from a restaurant parking lot. However, she found that it was “more
    difficult to say” that it is an ordinary use of an automobile to transport guns
    and assailants to a restaurant to effect a shooting and then to escape the
    scene.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge stated that “[t]he causation test
    presents a perhaps more challenging obstacle” for Ms. Russo.  She did not see as significant the factual
    difference that Ms. Russo was shot from a moving car, whereas the defendants in
    both <i>Lumbermens </i>and <i>Vytlingam</i> had gotten out of their
    vehicles before they committed the tortious acts.  According to the motion judge, this
    distinction did not place Ms. Russo’s situation outside the scope of the <i>Lumbermens </i>and<i> Vytlingam</i> decisions.  She
    pointed out that the Supreme Court made clear in <i>Vytlingam</i> that it is not enough that the tortfeasor’s car “contributed
    in some manner” to the tortfeasor’s ability to commit the tortious act.  Rather, the tortious act must be committed in
    the driver’s capacity as an at fault “motorist”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, while the motion judge accepted that the
    assailants’ vehicle “contributed in some manner” to Ms. Russo’s injuries, she concluded
    that “the shooting was separate and independent from the use and operation of
    the vehicle” and “[t]he fact that the assailants shot the gun from a motor
    vehicle does not make that act a ‘motoring activity’ that can attract
    indemnification.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the basis of this conclusion, the motion judge granted
    the respondent’s motion for summary judgment and dismissed Ms. Russo’s action.</p>
  <h3>IV. Analysis</h3>
  <p class=SubheadingItalics><strong>The Text of the Legislative Provisions</strong></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The starting point of the analysis is the text of the
    applicable legislative provisions. Section 3 of the OPCF 44R provides that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>...the insurer shall indemnify an eligible claimant
    for the amount that he or she is <i>legally
    entitled to recover</i> from an inadequately insured motorist as compensatory
    damages in respect of bodily injury to or death of an insured person arising <i>directly or indirectly from the use or
    operation of an automobile</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The text makes clear that the claimant must be “legally
    entitled to recover” from an at-fault inadequately insured motorist.  It is this feature of the legislative scheme that
    makes inapplicable the decision of the Supreme Court in <i>Amos v. Insurance Corp. of British Columbia</i>, [1995] 3 S.C.R. 405.  <i>Amos</i> related to no-fault statutory benefits.  This
    case, however, deals with at-fault insurance coverage; the Supreme Court’s
    decisions in <i>Lumbermens </i>and <i>Vytlingam </i>are therefore applicable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition to the requirement of an at-fault
    tortfeasor, the OPCF 44R Endorsement provides coverage only where the loss or
    damage arises “directly or indirectly from the use or operation” of an
    automobile.  Two fundamental elements of
    this phrase determine its scope.  First, as
    the provision includes “the use” and not just the “operation” of an automobile,
    its scope is broader than loss or damage that arises simply from a driver’s
    manipulation of the mechanical controls of an automobile.  Second, the provision covers loss or damage
    that arises both “indirectly” as well as “directly” from the use or operation
    of an automobile.  Given the elasticity
    of the word “indirectly”, it is necessary to look to the guidance provided by
    the Supreme Court to determine the limits of coverage provided by the OPCF 44R Endorsement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It must be kept in mind that the coverage in issue is part
    of a policy of automobile insurance.  As
    Binnie J. observed in <i>Vytlingam</i> at
    para. 4, “[i]nsurance policies must be interpreted in a way that gives effect
    to the reasonable expectations of both insured <i>and</i> insurer” (emphasis in original): citing <i>Reid Crowther &amp; Partners Ltd. v. Simcoe &amp; Erie General
    Insurance Co.,</i> [1993] 1 S.C.R. 252, at p. 269.  Accordingly, in order to trigger the OPCF 44R
    Endorsement, the at-fault defendant’s tort must be committed as a “motorist”.  There are two aspects to this inquiry – the purpose
    test and the causation test.  In <i>Vytlingam </i>at para. 12, Binnie J. articulated
    these tests as follows: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The questions are, firstly, whether the…claim is in
    respect of an inadequately insured tortfeasor whose fault occurred in the
    course of using a motor vehicle as a motor vehicle and not for some other
    purpose (as a diving platform, for example, as hereafter discussed), and
    secondly, whether the chain of causation linking the claimed loss or injuries
    to the use and operation of the motor vehicle, which is shown to be more than
    simply fortuitous or “but for”, is unbroken.</p>
  <p class=SubheadingItalics><strong>The Purpose Test</strong></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As indicated above, the purpose test asks “whether
    the…claim is in respect of an inadequately insured tortfeasor whose fault
    occurred <i>in the course of using a motor
    vehicle as a motor vehicle and not for some other purpose</i>” (emphasis
    added).  The test has a low threshold.  It excludes only aberrant uses of a motor
    vehicle and nothing more. Binnie J. fittingly described the OPCF 44R
    Endorsement as “a big tent” and added that “not much will be excluded as
    aberrant to the use of a motor vehicle as a motor vehicle”: <i>Vytlingam </i>at para. 22.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under the purpose test, it is the actual manner in
    which the motor vehicle is used that is determinative, not the subjective reasons
    the tortfeasor may have for climbing into the vehicle and using it: <i>Vytlingam </i>at para. 18.  As a result, the fact that a motor vehicle is
    used for a criminal purpose does not necessarily exclude coverage, provided the
    motor vehicle is used as a motor vehicle and not for some other aberrant
    purpose: <i>Vytlingam </i>at para. 18.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge, in concluding that the purpose test
    was not met in this case, refused to accept that “it is an ordinary use of an
    automobile when you add to the scenario that the vehicle is being used to carry
    guns and assailants to effect a shooting and to escape the scene.”  With respect, the motion judge erred in this
    analysis by improperly considering both the subjective reasons of Peretz for
    driving the car and the criminal activity for which the car was used.  I would put things much more generically – the
    motor vehicle was used to transport passengers and apparatus from one place to
    another.  Peretz used the van to
    transport Borrelli and Christoforou and their guns from wherever they were to
    the front of the restaurant.  Viewed from
    this perspective, Peretz’s use of the van was a well known and ordinary use of
    an automobile.  The purpose test, in my
    view, was met on the facts of this case, as far as Peretz is concerned.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I turn now to the causation test.</p>
  <p class=SubheadingItalics><strong>The Causation Tes</strong>t</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As noted above, the OPCF 44R Endorsement provides
    coverage only where the tortfeasor whose conduct is the subject matter of the
    indemnity claim is at fault as a motorist.  It is not enough that Ms. Russo’s damage would
    not have arisen “but for” Peretz’s use of the motor vehicle.  The “but for” test is not employed, as its
    application would cast too wide a net in extending coverage.  As Binnie J. explained in <i>Vytlingam</i> at paras. 25 and 28:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>For coverage to exist, there must be an unbroken
    chain of causation linking the conduct of the motorist as a motorist to the
    injuries in respect of which the claim is made.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The claimant must implicate the vehicle in respect
    of which coverage is claimed in a manner that is more than merely incidental or
    fortuitous.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms. Russo points out that the facts of both <i>Lumbermens </i>and <i>Vytlingam</i> are distinguishable from those of the present case.  In both of those cases, the tortfeasors
    stopped their vehicles, got out of them, and moved a short distance before
    committing the tortious acts.<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  By contrast, in this case, Peretz was
    driving the van throughout the incident.  Ms. Russo asserts that the motion judge failed
    to recognize this critical distinction. This distinction is used to develop the
    following thesis.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On the facts of this case, Peretz is clearly liable
    in tort to Ms. Russo as a joint tortfeasor for his involvement in the drive-by
    shooting, as he acted in furtherance of the wrong that resulted in her injury: see <i>Botiuk v. Toronto Free Press Publications Ltd</i>., <span class=ssl2>[1995]
    3 S.C.R. 3, at para. 74, citing John G. </span><span lang=EN-US>Fleming, <i>The
    Law of Torts</i>, 8th ed. (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Sydney,
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Australia</st1:country-region>
    : The
    Law Book Company Limited, 1992), at p. 255</span>.  She <span lang=EN-US>is<b> </b>therefore<b> “</b>legally entitled to recover”
    compensatory damages from him, as required by the OPCF<b> </b>44R Endorsement.  Moreover, Peretz’s
    action in furtherance of the wrong </span>– <span lang=EN-US>his active participation in the common plan </span>– <span
lang=EN-US>was the operation of the
    vehicle.  Throughout the group’s tortious
    behaviour that caused Ms. Russo’s injuries, Peretz continuously operated the
    van.  In particular, he operated it on a
    route and at a velocity as to orient it to facilitate the shooting.  His criminal intention and the criminal
    nature of his activity do not detract from the fact that Ms. Russo’s legal
    entitlement to recover compensatory damages from him in tort may be founded on
    his operation of the vehicle.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Russo urges that the motion judge should not have relied
    on obiter dicta from the reasons of the Supreme Court in <i>Vytlingam</i> disapproving of the decision of the British Columbia
    Court of Appeal in <i>Chan v. Insurance Corp.
    of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    British Columbia</i>,
    [1996] 4 W.W.R. 734.  In <i>Chan</i>, the plaintiff was injured while
    riding as a passenger in a car when she was struck by a brick thrown from an
    oncoming vehicle that fled the scene and was not subsequently identified.  Binnie J. commented that “[t]he rock throwing
    was an intervening act” and “the fact the brick was thrown from a car rather
    than a horse does not qualify it as a motoring activity”: <i>Vytlingam </i>at para. 31.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms. Russo submits that this dicta is not binding and
    does not precisely address the facts of this case.  According to her, the Supreme Court referred
    to the decision in <i>Chan</i> only to make
    the point that similar issues as arose in <i>Vytlingam</i> could arise in relation to unidentified vehicle indemnification insurance
    coverage.  While making that point, the
    court simply observed that throwing a brick is not motoring activity.  In this case, however, Peretz’s liability in
    tort is not based on his throwing of a brick or shooting of a gun, but rather on
    his operation of a motor vehicle. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based on this analysis, Ms. Russo submits that her
    legal entitlement to recover damages from Peretz is based on his acts as a
    motorist; there was no intervening act, as Peretz operated the van throughout.  It follows, she argues, that the causation
    test has also been satisfied.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There is a simple yet significant flaw in this argument:
    under the OPCF 44R Endorsement, it is the <i>bodily
    injury or death</i> for which damages are claimed, not the claimant’s legal
    entitlement to recover those damages, which must arise “directly or indirectly from
    the use or operation” of a motor vehicle.  Ms. Russo’s theory establishes merely that her legal entitlement to
    recover damages arises from Peretz’s use or operation of the van.  If this alone satisfied the requirements of
    the OPCF 44R Endorsement, coverage would be unjustifiably broad.  There would have been coverage, for example,
    in the <i>Vytlingam</i> situation if the
    driver had simply remained in the car while his passenger got out and dropped
    the boulder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is worth remembering Binnie J.’s admonition that the
    interpretation of a policy of automobile insurance should be interpreted in a
    way that gives effect to the reasonable expectations of both insured and
    insurer.  It is not reasonably expected
    that automobile insurance will cover injuries or death arising from the joint act
    of a group of tortfeasors simply because one tortfeasor’s involvement in the tortious
    act consists of operating a motor vehicle.  Automobile insurance does not cover injuries
    caused by robbers inside a bank even though the driver of the getaway car may
    be legally liable as a joint tortfeasor for the damages suffered.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here, Ms. Russo’s injuries did not arise from Peretz’s driving.
     Instead, her tragic injuries resulted
    from the shooting by Borrelli and Christoforou.  As the respondent submits, the shooting was a distinct and intervening
    act completely independent from the use or operation of the van.  Although the incident can indeed be
    characterized as a drive-by shooting, this characterization simply means that
    the vehicle “create[d] an opportunity in time and space for damage to be
    inflicted”: <i>Lumbermens </i>at para. 10.  This is not sufficient for the extension of
    coverage under the OPCF 44R Endorsement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, since the shooting was a severable
    intervening event from the use or operation of the motor vehicle, the OPCF 44R
    Endorsement does not apply and Ms. Russo is not entitled to coverage.</p>
  <h3>V. Disposition</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For these reasons, I would dismiss the appeal and
    affirm the decision of the motion judge.  Counsel indicated they would attempt to reach an agreement as to costs.  If they are unable to do so, they may make
    brief written submissions within 10 days.</p>

    car on the overpass, got out of the car, lifted the boulder out of the trunk of
    the car, and then carried the boulder a short distance to the overpass railing
    before lifting it over and dropping it onto the road below.  Similarly, in <i>Lumbermens</i>, the tortfeasor stopped his truck, got out of the truck,
    went behind the vehicle, and leaned on the truck to steady his aim before
    firing his rifle.</p>
