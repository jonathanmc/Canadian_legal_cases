  <h2>I.          OVERVIEW</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant, a lawyer, was convicted of two
    counts of laundering the proceeds of crime and one count of attempting to
    possess money obtained by crime.  He
    received sentences totalling three years and was ordered to pay a fine of
    $43,230.  The trial judge gave the
    appellant 12 months to pay the fine and imposed a 12-month sentence in default
    of payment.  The appellant appeals the convictions
    and sentence.  The Crown also appeals sentence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I would
    dismiss the conviction appeal.  I would
    grant leave to the Crown to appeal the sentence, allow the Crown’s sentence
    appeal and vary the sentence to five years.  Obviously, I would dismiss the appellant’s sentence appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    court did not call on the Crown on the conviction appeal.  The two issues argued by counsel for the
    appellant on the conviction appeal do not require detailed analysis.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

    Crown’s sentence appeal.</p>
  <h2>II.        FACTS</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Inspector William Majcher of the RCMP, posing as
    a front man for a large Colombian drug operation, met the appellant in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Florida in March
    2002.  In May 2002, the appellant agreed to
    launder large amounts of cash that Majcher told him were the proceeds of the Colombian
    cartel’s international cocaine trade.  Majcher told the appellant that the drug cartel generated profits of $3
    million a month and needed those profits laundered.  Majcher offered the appellant a fee of eight
    per cent to provide the necessary services and the appellant accepted that
    offer.  The appellant encouraged Majcher
    to do his money laundering business in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    indicating that there was
    little police oversight.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In June 2002, Majcher came to
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Toronto and gave the appellant CAD$250,000,
    which he said were the proceeds of the Colombian drug cartel’s cocaine business.  The appellant laundered these funds through a
    series of transactions and bank accounts in the names of shell
    corporations.  The funds eventually found
    their way into the Florida bank accounts controlled by the supposed drug cartel.  A few weeks later, Majcher gave the appellant
    USD$190,000.  Once again, the appellant laundered
    this money through a series of different bank accounts and eventually
    transferred the funds into the designated Florida bank accounts.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The FBI decided to terminate a related American
    operation and it became necessary to bring the undercover operation involving
    the appellant to an end in early August 2002.  The appellant was arrested.  He had received commissions of approximately
    CAD$43,000 on the two transactions.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Crown had an overwhelming case against the
    appellant.  It consisted of intercepted
    communications involving the appellant, videotaped meetings with the appellant
    and Majcher, and highly incriminating material seized from the appellant and
    his home at the time of his arrest.  The
    appellant did not testify.  No
    substantive defence was advanced at any time in the lengthy trial, including in
    trial counsel’s closing address.  Nor could
    counsel for the appellant, when invited to do so in this court, suggest any
    possible defence on the merits.</p>
  <h2>III.       THE
    CONVICTION APPEAL</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The investigation of the appellant grew out of a
    larger investigation involving the FBI and the RCMP.  Most of the evidence tendered against the
    appellant was gathered pursuant to a wiretap authorization issued by a justice
    of the Ontario Court of Justice on May 30, 2002.  The affidavit filed in support of the wiretap
    application included reference to a telephone conversation between the
    appellant and Majcher on May 22, 2002.  Majcher was in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Florida and the
    appellant was apparently in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto.  This conversation was intercepted under the
    auspices of the FBI and pursuant to permission granted by the senior FBI
    agent.  Under the applicable American
    law, permission to intercept conversations in which one of the participants
    consents to the interception can be granted by a senior police officer.  Unlike
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    , a judicial authorization is
    not required.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In his first argument, counsel for the appellant
    submitted that the interceptions made pursuant to the Canadian wiretap authorization
    granted on May 30, 2002 should have been excluded.  He further argued that without those
    conversations, the Crown could not prove the appellant’s guilt.  Counsel’s argument proceeded along the
    following line:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The interception of the May 22 conversation was
      subject to <i>Charter</i> scrutiny;</p>
    <p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On a <i>Charter</i> analysis, the interception was unreasonable and violated the appellant’s s. 8
      rights as it was made without prior judicial authorization:  see <i>R.
        v. Duarte</i>, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 30;</p>
    <p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Because the interception of the May 22
      conversation was unconstitutional, the information contained in that
      conversation must be excised from the affidavit used to obtain the Canadian
      authorization:  see <i>R. v. Grant</i>, [1993] 3 S.C.R. 223;</p>
    <p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Absent the information contained in the May 22
      conversation, there was not a sufficient evidentiary basis on which a judge,
      acting within the limits of the <i>Criminal
        Code</i> provisions, could grant an authorization to intercept private
      communications.  The authorization should
      not have been granted:  see <i>R. v. Garofoli</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1421;</p>
    <p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Because the authorization should not have been
      granted, the interceptions made pursuant to the authorization must be taken as having
      been made without a valid authorization and, therefore, in violation of s. 8;
      and</p>
    <p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;
font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The violation was sufficiently serious to merit
      exclusion of the evidence under s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Crown counsel, relying on the analysis in <i>R. v. Hape</i>, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 292, submitted
    that the interception of the May 22, 2002 conversation did not occur in Canada,
    was made under the authority of the FBI, and was not subject to <i>Charter</i> scrutiny.  I need not address the merits of that
    argument.  For the purpose of my
    analysis, I will assume that the <i>Charter</i> does reach that interception.  I will
    also assume that as the interception was not judicially authorized, it constituted
    an unreasonable search and violated the appellant’s rights under s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accepting the assumptions set out above, the
    appellant’s argument fails for two reasons.  First, even if the interception of the conversation was unlawful and
    violated s. 8, the officer swearing the information in support of the
    authorization was entitled to rely on the contents of that conversation as relayed
    to him by Majcher, one of the participants in the conversation: see <i>R. v. Fliss</i>, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 535, at
    para. 43.  A finding that the
    interception of the May 22 conversation violated the appellant’s s. 8 rights
    would not have affected the contents of the affidavit relied on by the police in
    support of the application for the Canadian wiretap authorization.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second, I agree with the Crown’s submission that
    the Canadian authorization would have been issued even if the affidavit
    contained no reference to the information provided in the May 22 telephone call.  The affidavit sworn in support of the
    application for the Canadian wiretap authorization contained abundant evidence,
    apart from the May 22 call, that would justify an order to intercept the
    appellant’s communications in respect of the named offences.  That conversation did little more than
    confirm earlier negotiations and arrange a further meeting.  Applying the well-known standard from <i>Garofoli</i>, the appellant has failed to
    show that the authorization could not have been granted had the contents of the
    May 22 conversation been unavailable to the police.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, even though I need not reach s. 24(2),
    I am convinced that the evidence obtained through the Canadian wiretap authorization
    would not be properly excluded under s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i> if the interceptions made pursuant to it were found to
    violate the appellant’s rights under s. 8.  I accept the trial judge’s finding of good faith on the part of the
    police.  The evidence of the
    interceptions is non-conscriptive, totally reliable, powerful and central to
    the prosecution of very serious offences.  All of these factors speak loudly in favour of admitting the evidence
    even if there was a breach of s. 8.  The
    appellant’s first argument cannot succeed.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for the appellant’s second argument
    alleges a failure to make full and proper disclosure.  This argument, like the first, is connected
    to the May 22 conversation and the attempt to demonstrate that the conversation
    was intercepted in violation of the appellant’s constitutional rights.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At trial, counsel (not counsel on appeal)
    brought an unsuccessful omnibus disclosure application seeking all notes and
    materials in the possession of the FBI in any way related to the investigations
    that led to the appellant’s arrest.  On
    appeal, counsel for the appellant limited the claim to a submission that the
    trial judge should have ordered the Crown to produce, or at least make its best
    efforts to obtain, relevant information in the possession of the FBI agent who
    approved the interception of the May 22 telephone conversation.  Counsel argued that this disclosure was
    necessary to enable the defence to make a proper challenge to the
    constitutionality of the interception of the May 22 conversation and, hence, to
    the ultimate admissibility of the evidence intercepted under the Canadian
    authorization.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Clearly, the argument advanced on appeal is a
    much more focussed one than the argument put to the trial judge.  Counsel for the appellant acknowledges that
    the trial judge’s failure to order the Crown to produce the material in the
    possession of the FBI referable to the granting of the consent to intercept the
    May 22 conversation was relevant only to the issues raised on the <i>Garofoli</i> application and, more
    specifically, relevant only to the constitutionality of the interception of the
    May 22 conversation.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I have assumed that the interception of the May
    22 conversation was unconstitutional for the purpose of this appeal.  All the disclosure in the world from the FBI
    pertaining to that conversation could not put the appellant in a better
    position than I have assumed he is in for the purpose of considering and
    rejecting his argument based on the unconstitutionality of the May 22
    conversation.  This disclosure argument
    is of no consequence given my approach to the first argument advanced on behalf
    of the appellant.</p>
  <h2>IV.       THE
    CROWN’S SENTENCE APPEAL</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    trial, the Crown sought a sentence of between five and seven years.  Defence counsel submitted that a two-year
    sentence was appropriate and asked the trial judge to consider imposing the

style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the sentencing proceedings at trial, Crown
    counsel called Inspector Majcher to testify how he came to meet the appellant.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

    capacity, he was dealing with a money launderer named King in the
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Bahamas</st1:country-region>
    .  King told Majcher that he knew a person who
    could assist in injecting large amounts of cash obtained through criminal
    activity into the international banking system.  King went on to indicate that he had done business with this person for
    quite some time and that this person could handle large amounts of cash.  King spoke with this person on the telephone
    on March 8, 2002 in Majcher’s presence.  A meeting was arranged for March 11.  At some stage, King identified the person as Simon Rosenfeld. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Majcher met with the appellant in
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Florida on March 11,
    2002.  They discussed the appellant’s
    ability to launder large amounts of cash.  The appellant was not prepared to launder money in the
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      United States</st1:country-region>
    and told Majcher that he charged 12 per cent commission.  Majcher told the appellant he usually paid
    about five per cent.  During the
    conversation, Majcher made it clear that the money being discussed was the
    proceeds of international cocaine trafficking.  During this first meeting, Majcher gave the appellant a one dollar bill
    and the appellant assured him that from that point forward their conversations
    were protected by the client/solicitor privilege.  These initial discussions eventually led to
    the agreement to launder millions of dollars in drug money for a commission of eight
    per cent.  The two transactions described
    earlier in these reasons were a product of that agreement.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Crown relied on this evidence, as well as
    many of the appellant’s statements made in the intercepted communications with
    Majcher, to demonstrate that the appellant was a “professional” money launderer.  Crown counsel submitted that:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>[T]his is not a
    lawyer who is unwilling; this is not a lawyer who is wilfully blind.  This is a corrupt lawyer who is taking
    advantage of and this is his business.  <u>The
    bottom line is that this is his business.</u>  Whether it’s laundering drug monies or stock fraud pump and dumps.  <u>This is his business.</u>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Crown counsel stressed several other aggravating
    factors in her submissions.  She contended
    that the appellant’s belief that his actions were directly assisting those at
    the top of the international cocaine trade rendered his conduct at least as
    culpable as the conduct of persons who aided in the drug trade in other ways.  Counsel submitted that those individuals,
    even though there are often mitigating circumstances surrounding their
    involvement in the drug trade, normally receive lengthy penitentiary
    sentences.  She submitted that the
    appellant’s punishment should be comparable.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Crown counsel also submitted that the
    appellant’s position as a lawyer was a significant aggravating factor.  Relying on Majcher’s evidence and documentary
    evidence placed before the trial judge on sentence, she argued that lawyers in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    were
    particularly useful to those seeking to hide “dirty” money.  Canadian lawyers, unlike other professionals
    and financial institutions in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    and elsewhere, are not subject to reporting requirements with respect to large cash
    transactions.  Lawyers also can shield
    their activities behind client/solicitor privilege.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Crown counsel argued that the appellant’s
    comments on the intercepted conversations indicate that he was aware of the
    advantages his profession gave him and that he was prepared to use those
    advantages to further the criminal activity in which he was involved.  Counsel contended that the appellant’s
    willingness to misuse his status as a lawyer was made all the more serious
    because of his obligations as a barrister and solicitor to the administration
    of justice.  Crown counsel argued that the
    appellant’s comments on the wiretaps revealed a disdain for the criminal justice
    system and a total disregard for his responsibilities as a lawyer.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Crown counsel stressed the international nature
    of the criminal activity that the appellant believed he was assisting through
    his money laundering efforts.  She
    submitted that
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    ’s
    international obligations and reputation required the imposition of a sentence that
    reflected
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    ’s
    commitment to stand with other countries in the international community against
    the threat posed by international organized crime.    Crown
    counsel referred to comments made by the appellant to Majcher suggesting that
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    was seen
    as a relatively safe haven for those looking for a place to inject their
    criminal proceeds into legitimate financial markets.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, Crown counsel submitted that the
    appellant’s personal circumstances presented little by way of mitigation.  There was no evidence of remorse and greed
    appeared to be the only motive for the appellant’s actions.  Counsel observed that the appellant lived a
    lavish lifestyle while bragging that he structured his affairs to avoid paying
    his debts and his taxes.  Counsel
    depicted the appellant as a person who, despite having the means to earn a
    legitimate living, chose instead to pursue a criminal path that would fund a lavish
    and extravagant lifestyle.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant did not call any evidence on
    sentencing.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4"

    sentencing.  He was married and had three
    children (ages 19, 16 and 10).  The
    appellant had no criminal record.  He was
    a lawyer in the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    province
    of
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">

    apparently did not spend much of his time practising law.  He was an undischarged bankrupt.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Defence counsel argued that the wiretap
    interceptions did not demonstrate that the appellant was running a sophisticated,
    well-organized money laundering operation.  Counsel contended that the interceptions showed that the two transactions
    did not go smoothly, and that the appellant seemed out of his depth.  Counsel also argued that despite some of the
    appellant’s statements during the intercepted communications, there was no hard
    evidence that he engaged in money laundering on any occasion other than the two
    transactions that were the subject matter of these charges.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Defence counsel urged the trial judge not to
    accept the statements made by the appellant on the wiretaps at face value.  Counsel submitted that the appellant was making
    things up so that Majcher would believe that he was a “player” in the criminal
    underworld.  Counsel pointed out that the
    appellant contradicted himself several times and that some of his comments were
    obvious exaggerations.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Defence counsel also urged the trial judge to
    take into consideration the appellant’s bail conditions for the almost three
    years that it took to get the charges through the criminal justice system.  Counsel submitted that the restrictions on
    his liberty should be taken into account and that the appellant’s compliance
    with the bail terms demonstrated that he was a good candidate for a conditional
    sentence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge identified general deterrence as
    the paramount consideration in sentencing the appellant.  She accepted most of the submissions made by
    Crown counsel.  The trial judge did not,
    however, make a specific finding as to the extent, if any, of the appellant’s
    involvement in money laundering beyond these two transactions.  She referred, with apparent approval, to
    evidence suggesting a broader involvement, but she made no specific finding of
    fact.</p>
  <h3><span style='font-style:normal'>(b)       The Fitness of the Sentence</span></h3>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr. Wakely, for the Crown, in very able
    submissions, frankly acknowledged that the three-year sentence imposed by the
    trial judge was not inconsistent with sentences imposed on lawyers for similar
    offences.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[5]</span></span></span></a>  Nor did Mr. Wakely suggest that the trial
    judge committed any error in principle.  He argued, however, that the relatively few sentences imposed on lawyers
    who were involved in sophisticated, large-scale money laundering operations were
    far too low to adequately reflect the seriousness of the offence and adequately
    express society’s denunciation of the conduct of lawyers whose actions aided
    and abetted large-scale, organized international crime.  Mr. Wakely submitted that a three-year
    sentence is demonstrably unfit and, therefore, properly the subject of
    appellate variation:  see <i>R. v. M. (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    )</i>, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 500.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There is a danger in generalizing when
    describing the imposition of an appropriate sentence.  Canadian sentencing philosophy has avoided
    the concept of tariff sentencing for certain kinds of offences and favoured an
    approach that recognizes the uniqueness of each sentencing problem.  Sentencing judges in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    must tailor
    the sentence to the specifics of the offence and the specifics of the offender:  see <i>Criminal
    Code</i>, s. 718.1.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Consequently, I do not adopt Crown counsel’s
    sweeping condemnation of sentences imposed on lawyers for this kind of offence.  I do, however, accept the submission that in
    the specific circumstances of this case, a significantly longer jail term was
    required to adequately reflect the seriousness of the offence and the
    appellant’s level of culpability.  Three
    years is demonstrably unfit.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In coming to my conclusion, I have considered
    the submissions of counsel both here and at trial.  I find myself in substantial agreement with
    Crown counsel’s submissions.  I emphasize
    the following features of the case:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p><span style='font-size:11.0pt;

line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I begin with what the appellant believed was the
    source of the money he was laundering.  From
    the appellant’s perspective, the important one when assessing his culpability,
    this was no victimless crime.  The
    appellant thought he was playing a crucial role in the successful operation of
    the international cocaine trade.  That
    trade kills countless people and destroys the lives of even more.  The appellant’s conduct was designed to give
    the appearance of legitimacy to the profits reaped from one of the most
    nefarious and socially harmful of all criminal activities.  His culpability is properly analogized to
    others who perform services to assist those who control and reap the profits of
    the international cocaine trade:  see <i>R. v. Roa</i>, [1996] J.Q. No. 46 (C.A.).  The fact that the appellant was dealing with
    an undercover officer and not a real representative of a drug cartel does not
    mitigate his conduct.<a href="#_ftn6"
name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[6]</span></span></span></a>  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant’s money laundering operation was a
    significant one.  He earned almost
    $50,000 in less than a month for the services he provided in respect of two substantial
    transactions.  The appellant fully expected
    to earn much more in what he anticipated would be an ongoing and growing
    relationship with the drug cartel.  The
    appellant’s operation had some degree of complexity and sophistication.  He set up various bank accounts in different
    jurisdictions in the names of corporate shells he controlled. The appellant
    funnelled the funds through these accounts to their ultimate destination.  The appellant also used others to perform banking
    services for him, thereby sheltering his own identity.  This operation could not have come into existence
    overnight.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Money was the appellant’s only motive.  While the value to both individual and
    general deterrence of longer jail sentences can be questioned in many contexts,<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[7]</span></span></span></a> I think
    it has value for offenders like the appellant.  If any offender engages in a “risk/benefit” analysis before engaging in
    criminal activity, it is an offender like the appellant.  The appellant had choices.  He did not stumble into this criminal
    activity.  Nor did circumstances push him
    into this criminal activity.  The only reasonable
    inference is that the appellant chose criminal activity over legitimate ways of
    pursuing a living because the criminal activity offered the possibility of
    quicker, easier and larger profits.  Persons
    like the appellant who measure success by the size of their monetary gain, must
    understand that the potential for quick, large gains through criminal conduct comes
    at the risk of detection and the imposition of a long jail term.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant’s status as a lawyer is a
    significant aggravating factor for two distinct reasons.  First, apart from the specifics of the
    offences committed by the appellant, those privileged to practise law take on a
    public trust in exchange for that privilege and the many advantages that come
    with it.  Lawyers are duty bound to protect
    the administration of justice and enhance its reputation within their
    community.  Criminal activity by lawyers
    in the course of performing functions associated with the practice of law in
    its broadest sense, has exactly the opposite effect.  Lawyers like the appellant who choose to use
    their skills and abuse the privileges attached to service in the law not only
    discredit the vast majority of the profession, but also feed public cynicism of
    the profession.  In the long run, that
    cynicism must undermine public confidence in the justice system:  see <i>R.
    v. Oliver</i>, [1977] 5 W.W.R. 344 (B.C.C.A.).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The second reason the appellant’s status as a
    lawyer is an aggravating factor relates to the specifics of this crime.  Lawyers, for arguably valid reasons, are
    exempt from the reporting conditions applicable to other professions and
    financial institutions who deal in cash transactions.  The communications between lawyers and their
    clients, also for valid reasons, are protected from disclosure by the client/solicitor
    privilege.  This privilege attaches
    uniquely to lawyers and their clients.  The wiretap interceptions and Majcher’s evidence demonstrate that the
    appellant appreciated the advantage to a money laundering operation of both the
    solicitor’s exemption from the reporting conditions and the client/solicitor
    privilege.  He was ready and willing to
    abuse these specific privileges available to him because of his status as a
    lawyer to enhance his money laundering services.  The appellant’s willingness to prostitute his
    legal services and abuse the special privileges associated with them are significant
    aggravating features of his conduct.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Lastly, I turn to the nature of the appellant’s
    involvement in the money laundering world and the criminal activities
    associated with it.  I can accept that
    the appellant engaged in hyperbole in his conversations with Majcher because he
    was doing his very best to impress someone he believed to be a major player in
    the drug trade.  That is, however, hardly
    a mitigating factor.  Why would the appellant
    want so badly to impress Majcher?  The
    only answer must be because he very much wanted Majcher’s business.  The appellant was clearly an experienced
    money launderer when he met Majcher.  That
    experience is evident not only from the appellant’s discussions about money
    laundering with Majcher, but also from the manner in which the appellant
    initially came to Majcher’s attention.  Another money launderer in the
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Bahamas</st1:country-region>
    introduced the appellant to
    Majcher as a person who that other money launderer knew could handle large
    amounts of “dirty” cash.  That is exactly
    the service that the appellant made available to Majcher.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant presented himself as a person wise
    in the ways of money laundering.  He also
    consistently and aggressively promoted himself to Majcher as a person who could
    provide more and better services for the drug cartel Majcher represented.  The appellant suggested that these services could
    go beyond money laundering to include other criminal activities, including drug
    dealing.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant was not caught in a moment of
    weakness.  He was not in any manner of
    speaking a victim of circumstances.  Nor
    was the appellant wilfully blind as what were initially legitimate legal
    services slid from the legal into the illegal.  As Crown counsel at trial aptly put it, the appellant was in the
    business of laundering the proceeds of large-scale, international criminal
    activity.  The intercepted communications
    demonstrate beyond peradventure that he was anxious to grow that business and branch
    out to other forms of criminal conduct.  </p>

    offers precious little to offset the litany of aggravating features present in
    this case.  I propose to refer to only
    one of the mitigating features put forward by counsel at trial.  Pre-conviction bail conditions can be
    relevant on sentencing.  However, in the absence
    of any evidence as to the effect on the appellant of his bail conditions and
    the absence of any explanation for the delay in proceeding through trial, I am
    not prepared to give the appellant any credit for his pre-conviction bail
    status.  Given the strength of the case
    against him, I would think that the appellant would have been very happy had
    this case never gone to trial.  The long delay
    in the prosecution of the appellant’s appeal, while the appellant remained on
    bail, further indicates that he was only too happy to be on bail and leave the
    matter unresolved.  I am sure he knew
    that incarceration was the only realistic outcome when these proceedings
    ultimately came to an end.  </p>

    involvement in them required that the objectives of societal denunciation, general
    deterrence and specific deterrence be given priority in fixing the appropriate
    sentence.  A substantial penitentiary
    term was the only sentence that could properly reflect these objectives. The five-
    to seven-year range suggested by the Crown at trial was not inappropriate.  I would allow the appeal and vary the
    sentence to five years.  The fine
    component of the sentence remains as imposed at trial.            RELEASED:  “DD” “APR 15 2009”</p>

    the appellant to be assessed by a psychiatrist, Dr. Graham D. Glancy, or
    alternatively to allow Dr. Glancy to attend and testify on the sentencing.  The trial judge refused to further adjourn
    the already protracted trial proceedings.  While we see no error in that decision, we did allow appellate counsel
    to file the report of Dr. Glancy with this court.  I have considered the report.  Apart from providing certain additional
    personal information about the appellant, the report did not assist in
    determining the appropriate penalty.</p>

    direction of, a criminal organization.  Section 718.2(a)(iv) of the <i>Code</i> recognizes this as an aggravating factor on sentence.  The appellant was, of course, despite his
    best efforts, not working for a criminal organization.  Consequently, the section has no direct
    application.</p>
