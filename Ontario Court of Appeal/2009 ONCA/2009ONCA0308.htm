  <h2>OVERVIEW</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The issue in this appeal is whether the
    appellant had a right of rescission under the <i>Arthur Wishart Act</i> <i>(Franchise
    Disclosure), 2000</i>, S.O. 2000, c. 3 (the Act).  The appellant is the franchisee of a Baton
    Rouge Restaurant located in the City of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Oakville
    and seeks to rely on s. 6(2) of the Act as a basis for rescission of its
    franchise agreement. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant originally executed a franchise
    agreement with Baton Rouge Restaurants Company (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Baton Rouge), which subsequently sold the
    franchise to a corporation that became Imvescor Restaurants Inc., the successor
    franchisor.  Sara-Mammas Corporation Inc.
    is the successor of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Baton Rouge.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant brought a motion in the form of a
    special case pursuant to Rule 22 of the <i>Rules
    of Civil Procedure</i>, R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 194.  The special case arose in the following context: the appellant paid
    $15,000 relating to the franchise; the appellant received a disclosure document
    two months after the payment; and the appellant signed a franchise agreement
    six months after receiving the disclosure document.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motion judge determined that the appellant
    did not have a right of rescission under the Act.  It is from this decision that the appellant
    now appeals.</p>
  <p><b>RELEVANT STATUTORY
    PROVISIONS</b></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Sections 5(1) and (4) of the Act provide as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left;'>5(1)     A franchisor shall
    provide a prospective franchisee with a disclosure document and the prospective
    franchisee shall receive the disclosure document not less than 14 days before
    the earlier of,</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left;'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    signing by the prospective franchisee of the franchise agreement or any other
    agreement relating to the franchise; and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left;'>(b) the payment of any
    consideration by or on behalf of the prospective franchisee to the franchisor
    or franchisors associate relating to the franchise.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(4)       The disclosure document
    shall contain,</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left;'>(a) all material facts,
    including material facts as prescribed;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left;'>(b) financial statements as
    prescribed;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left;'>(c) copies of all proposed
    franchise agreements and other agreements relating to the franchise to be
    signed by the prospective franchisee;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left;'>(d) statements as prescribed
    for the purposes of assisting the prospective franchisee in making informed
    investment decisions; and </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left;'>(e) other information and
    copies of documents as prescribed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The rescission rights are contained in s. 6 of
    the Act, which provides:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left;'>6(1)     A franchisee may rescind
    the franchise agreement, without penalty or obligation, no later than 60 days
    after receiving the disclosure document, if the franchisor failed to provide
    the disclosure document or a statement of material change within the time
    required by section 5 or if the contents of the disclosure document did not
    meet the requirements of section 5.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left;'>(2)       A franchisee may
    rescind the franchise agreement, without penalty or obligation, no later than
    two years after entering into the franchise agreement if the franchisor never
    provided the disclosure document.</p>
  <h2>FACTS </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The facts set out in this special case, which
    were relied upon by the motion judge, are as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>i.          on June 8, 2005, the appellant as a
    prospective franchisee paid $15,000 to the franchisor relating to the franchise
    in issue; </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>ii.         on August 15, 2005, prior to the
    execution of any franchise agreement, the appellant received a document
    entitled Ontario Franchise disclosure document, (disclosure document); </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>iii.       for the purposes of this special case and
    without prejudice to any position which the appellant may subsequently wish to
    adopt, the court is to assume that the contents of the disclosure document
    fully complied with the provisions of section 5(4) of the Act; </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>iv.        on February 17, 2006, approximately six
    months after the delivery of the disclosure document,&nbsp; the appellant
    executed a franchise agreement with the franchisor; and </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>v.         on February 15, 2008, the appellant
    served on the franchisor and other interested parties a notice of rescission in
    respect of the franchise agreement.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motion judge held that the rescission rights
    provided for in s. 6 of the Act were not available to the appellant.  Specifically, he found that the appellant did
    not have a right to rescind the franchise agreement under s. 6(2) because this
    section only applies where the franchisor never provides disclosure.  Further, given that the appellant had six
    months to consider the disclosure document before signing the franchise
    agreement, the motion judge held that s. 6(1) of the Act also did not provide a
    right of rescission.</p>
  <h2>ISSUE</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The sole issue on this appeal is the meaning of
    ss. 6(1) and (2) of the Act, particularly when read together with s. 5 of the
    Act. </p>
  <h2>POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span class=Prompt><span style='color:black'>The appellant submits that the motion judge erred, and that
    it was entitled to rescission within two years of having executed the franchise
    agreement pursuant to s.&nbsp;6(2) of the Act<i>.</i>  In essence, the appellant </span></span>argues
    that the interpretation and interaction of ss. 5 and 6 of the Act are each of
    fundamental importance to the entire purpose of the legislation, namely, to
    protect franchisees by requiring franchisors to provide proper disclosure before
    a franchisee provides consideration or signs an agreement.  The appellant contends that to interpret the
    relevant sections of the Act as the motion judge did defeats the overall
    purpose of the Act. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondents contend that the decision of the
    motion judge was correct.  In particular,
    they argue that the result is consistent with the clear and unambiguous
    language of the Act, which states that s. 6(2) only applies where a disclosure
    document was never provided.   Further, according to the respondents, the
    decision of the motion judge also accords with the modern principles of
    statutory interpretation and the purpose of the Act. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For the reasons that follow, I agree with the
    motion judge that the position of the respondents is the correct one.  That is, s. 6 of the Act does not permit the appellant to deliver its notice of
    rescission up to two years after executing the franchise agreement when it has
    been provided with a disclosure document.  Accordingly, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h2>ANALYSIS</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Before proceeding to examine the merits of the
    appeal, I will very briefly address a preliminary issue.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'>            <b><i>(i)        Assumed facts</i></b></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On the motion, the parties agreed that the
    motion judge could assume that the disclosure document fully complied with the disclosure
    provisions of s. 5(4) of the Act.&nbsp;
    That agreement was without prejudice to any position which the appellant may
    subsequently wish to adopt.  In <i>Law Society of Upper Canada v. Ernst &amp;
    Young</i> (2003), 65 O.R. (3d) 577, application for leave to appeal dismissed, [2004]
    1 S.C.R. viii, this court held that summary judgment motions are not to be
    decided on assumed facts where doing so would create a hypothetical question
    that could be answered differently at trial.  The parties in the case at bar were asked to address this issue. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For our purposes, the relevant parts of Rule 22
    provide:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>22.04  A special case (Form 22A) shall,</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(a) set out concisely the material
    facts, as agreed to by the parties, that are necessary to enable the court to
    determine the question stated;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(b) refer to and include a copy of any
    documents that are necessary to determine the question;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(c) set out the relief sought, as
    agreed on by the parties, on the determination of the question of law;</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On the motion brought by way of special case
    pursuant to Rule 22, the facts before the court were based on evidence not in
    dispute and agreed upon for all purposes of the motion.  The only assumption was as to the content
    requirements of the disclosure document, and not as to any of the time
    requirements.  The issue before the
    motion judge was related specifically to the timing issue and not to
    content.  Thus, no facts relevant to the
    ultimate decision sought on the motion  namely, the effect of the failure to
    comply with the time requirements set out in s. 5 of the Act  were in dispute.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the end, the parties agreement on the facts
    at issue in the motion distinguishes this case from the<i> Law Society</i> decision.  The
    motion judge, in my view, was correct in his decision to proceed and decide the
    motion.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I will now discuss the merits of the appeal.</p>

'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The core argument of the appellant is that the Act
    contemplates that a properly informed decision or an informed investment
    decision made by a prospective franchisee must be one unencumbered by
    extraneous considerations, such as the assumption of debt to a third party,
    before<i> </i>any event described in s. 5(1)
    occurs.  According to the appellant, this
    means that disclosure under the Act must be made before the prospective
    franchisee pays any monies or makes any legal commitments related to the
    franchise.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant notes that the importance of a
    properly informed decision has been reinforced by this court in <i>1490664 Ontario Ltd. v. Dig This Garden
    Retailers Ltd.</i> (2005), 256 D.L.R. (4th) 451, at para. 16, and in <i>Personal Service Coffee Corp. v. Beer</i> (2005),
    256 D.L.R. (4th) 466, at para. 28.  The
    appellant argues, however, that although the motion judge acknowledged the
    Acts purpose, he failed to properly give effect to it.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant asserts that a brief review of the
    Act makes it clear that the above purpose is reflected throughout its various
    provisions.  For example, it says that the
    requirements surrounding disclosure found in s. 5 of the Act are critical to
    interpreting s.&nbsp;6(2).  When read
    together, the contention is, it becomes clear that all disclosure obligations
    under s. 5 must be fulfilled before either of the events described under s. 5(1)
    occurs.  Such a reading, it is argued, is
    consistent with the statutes purpose.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The sum of the appellants submissions is that
    any purposive, harmonious interpretation of the provisions of the Act must be
    consistent with the protection of franchisees through, <i>inter alia</i>, the effective imposition of rigorous disclosure by
    franchisors.  Conversely, any provisions
    of the Act which appear to contradict, frustrate, reduce, abrogate or even
    nullify the protection of franchisees or the method by which such protections
    are enforced must be carefully scrutinized and met with scepticism: <i>Personal Service Coffee</i>, at para. 28.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>By way of illustration  and as it was argued on
    the motion  the appellant says that by reading s. 6(1) as the respondents propose,
    the appellant could only have rescinded the franchise agreement within sixty
    days after being provided with the disclosure document.  But, given that the franchise agreement had
    not been signed within sixty days, it makes no sense and does not fulfill the
    purpose of the legislation to require the prospective franchisee to rescind the
    franchise agreement long before it was even made.&nbsp; This scenario, the
    appellant argues, calls for a different interpretation that ensures that the
    purpose of the legislation is fulfilled.&nbsp; That is to say, the
    interpretation urged by the appellant would construe s. 6(2) as applying if a disclosure
    document was provided but only outside of the time required by section 5. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Like the motion judge, I disagree.  The Act provides clear guidance as to when a
    franchisor must deliver a disclosure document as well as the consequences of
    the failure to do so.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In respect to timing, s. 5 of the Act ensures
    that a prospective franchisee has at least fourteen days to review and consider
    a disclosure document before signing a franchise agreement or paying
    consideration in relation to a franchise.  In the event that the franchisor does not comply with s. 5, the Act
    provides the franchisee with an extraordinary remedy: the right to rescind the
    franchise agreement with two different limitation periods, depending on when
    and whether the franchisor provides a disclosure document. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First, s. 6(1) permits rescission within sixty
    days of receipt of the disclosure document if the disclosure document is not
    provided within the time required by s. 5.  Not only did the appellant not provide a notice
    of rescission within sixty days of receiving the document, but it also had six
    months to consider the disclosure document before entering into the
    agreement.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='color:black'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second, under s. 6(2), a franchisee may rescind
    a franchise agreement within two years, but only if there was no disclosure
    document provided by the franchisor.  In
    particular, for s. 6(2) to apply, the franchisor must never have provided the disclosure
    document.  The time for rescission under s.
    6(2) starts to run from the date when the franchise agreement was signed, owing
    to the fact that unlike under s. 6(1)  where the applicable time starts when a
    proper disclosure document is provided  s. 6(2) applies to a situation where
    there is no disclosure document provided at all. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='color:black'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In sum, s. 6(1) provides for a sixty day
    rescission period if either a franchisor fails to deliver a disclosure document
    within the required time periods under s. 5 or the contents of a disclosure
    document did not meet the requirements of s. 5.  Section 6(2) provides for a two year rescission period in the event of a
    failure by the franchisor to deliver a disclosure document. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To state it in the terms of the appellants
    arguments, s. 6(1) applies to a situation in which the franchisee was unable to
    make a fully informed decision as a result of inadequate time for consideration
    of such decision or inadequate disclosure of the material facts.  Section 6(2) applies to a situation in which
    the franchisee is unable to make an informed decision at all because of a
    complete lack of a disclosure document.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As noted, there was disclosure in this case. As
    the motion judge correctly held, s. 6(2) of the Act, therefore, has no
    application.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The motion judge also found that s. 6(1) was not
    available to the appellant on the facts of this case, noting at para. 12 that s.
    6(1) does not purport to provide a rescission right in all circumstances.  Again, I agree with the motion judge. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section 6(1) contemplates a situation in which a
    franchisor has failed to comply with the timing or content requirements of the
    Act in respect of a disclosure document.  It extends the time normally provided for the review of the disclosure
    document (at least fourteen days) to afford a franchisee sixty days from the
    date the disclosure document is given to review the disclosure document and
    determine whether to rescind a binding franchise agreement.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In this
    case, no notice of rescission under the Act was provided within the sixty day
    window, presumably because no agreement had been entered into in that
    time.  In fact, the appellant took six
    months from the receipt of the disclosure document to decide whether to be
    bound by the franchise agreement at all.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    these reasons, I would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h2><i>(iii)     Principles
    of statutory interpretation</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman";color:black'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant also argues that the motion judge
    failed to give appropriate or sufficient weight to the imperative language of
    s. 5 that uses words like shall and must to describe a franchisors
    obligations.  His interpretation of s. 6,
    it says, effectively frustrates the purpose of s. 5.  This in turn leads to an absurd result which is
    not in keeping with principles of statutory interpretation; franchisors face no
    strict penalties for failing to comply with the disclosure imperative of s. 5,
    which in turn defeats the purpose of the Act.  I would reject this argument. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman";color:black'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>The appellants
    interpretation is entirely inconsistent with the modern approach to statutory
    interpretation in that it neither reflects the ordinary and grammatical sense
    of the language used, nor is it harmonious with the scheme of the Act or the
    express intention of the legislature.  In <i>Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership v. Rex</i>, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 559, at para. 26, Iacobucci J. for the court
    referred to the preferred approach to statutory interpretation as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In Elmer Driedgers
    definitive formulation, found at p. 87 of his <i>Construction of Statutes </i>(2<sup>nd</sup> ed. 1983):</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>Today there is only one principle or approach,
    namely, the words of an Act are
    to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense
    harmoniously with the scheme of the Act,
    the object of the Act, and the
    intention of Parliament.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Driedgers modern
    approach has been repeatedly cited by this Court as the preferred approach to
    statutory interpretation across a wide range of interpretive settings
    [citations omitted].  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Act, interpreted in the light of this modern
    interpretive approach, is clear that a rescission remedy is available to the
    franchisee in two separate situations, and that the two situations are not to
    be blurred into one.  This interpretation
    is further bolstered by the purpose of the Act, which is in part to ensure that
    the franchisee has at least fourteen days to review a disclosure document
    before signing an agreement.  The legislature
    clearly chose to reserve the two year remedy for instances of a complete
    failure to provide a disclosure document.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section 6(2) of the Act cannot be triggered in
    cases where a disclosure document is provided, because it expressly applies
    only when a disclosure document was never provided.  To accept the appellants submissions as to the
    applicability of s. 6(2) to this case would be inconsistent with, and contrary
    to, the inclusion of s. 6(1) in the Act, which speaks directly to the
    consequences of a franchisors failure to provide a disclosure document that
    meets the timing and/or content requirements of the Act.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While the Act does not expressly provide a right
    of rescission in circumstances where a disclosure document is delivered late,
    but more than sixty days in advance of the execution of a franchise agreement,
    this does not impose an injustice as the appellant suggests.  Rather, the purpose of the Act is still met
    in such circumstances because the franchisee has sufficient time  at least
    sixty days  to make an informed decision as to whether or not to enter into
    the franchise agreement.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A fair interpretation of the Act is one that
    balances the rights of both franchisees and franchisors. To read in the remedy
    that the appellant is proposing is inconsistent with such an interpretation and
    was clearly not within the contemplation of the legislature.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, the motion judges interpretation does
    not give rise to absurd results.  Rather,
    it is the appellants argument that does so in that if applied, the s. 6(1)
    remedy provided by the legislature would be rendered pointless.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellant urged this court to consider two
    recent decisions of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice: <i>Sovereignty Investment Holdings, Inc. v. 9127-6907 Quebec Inc.</i>, 2008
    CanLII 57450 (ON S.C.), and <i>6862892
    Canada Limited v. Dollar It Limited</i>, 2008 CanLII 60699 (ON S.C.).  In my view, however, these cases are of no
    assistance to the appellant. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>These cases do not stand for the broader
    conclusion, proposed by the appellant, that any failure to comply with s. 5
    results in a finding of no disclosure and therefore a s.&nbsp;6(2) remedy.  On my reading of the two cases, they hold that
    if the disclosure document that is provided turns out to be materially
    deficient, then no disclosure will be found to be have been made.  On the facts, that is not what happened here.  The disclosure document was merely late. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant had ample time to review the disclosure document before executing the
    franchise agreement, and had it rescinded even after the sixty day period but
    prior to the signing of the agreement, it would have been entitled to a refund
    of $15,000 already paid, under its common law right to relief. </p>
  <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
