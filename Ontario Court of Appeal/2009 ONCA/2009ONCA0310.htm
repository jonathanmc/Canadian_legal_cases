    provisions of the <i>Criminal Code</i>: ss.
    254(3) and 258(1)(c).  These provisions
    have been amended since the respondents’ trials, but the amendments have no
    bearing on the common issue. The provisions that were in force when the
    respondents were tried are as follows:</p>

    and probable grounds that a person is committing, or at any time within the
    preceding three hours has committed, as a result of the consumption of alcohol,
    an offence under section 253</i> [impaired driving or driving “over 80”], the
    peace officer may, by demand made to that person forthwith or as soon as
    practicable, require that person to provide then or as soon thereafter as is
    practicable</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:

    samples of the person’s breath as in the opinion of a qualified technician…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;'>are
    necessary to enable proper analysis to be made in order to determine the
    concentration, if any, of alcohol in the person’s blood, and to accompany the
    peace officer for the purpose of enabling such samples to be taken.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>258. (1) In any
    proceedings under subsection 255(1) in respect of an offence committed under
    section 253 or in any proceedings under subsection 255(2) or (3),</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left;'>(c)   <i>where samples of the breath of the accused

  <blockquote>
    <p align="left" class="Doubleindent-quote" style="text-align:

      sample was taken as soon as practicable after the time when the offence was
      alleged to have been committed and, in the case of the first sample, not later
      than two hours after that time, with an interval of at least fifteen minutes
      between the times when the samples were taken,</p>
    <p align="left" class="Doubleindent-quote" style="text-align:

      sample was received from the accused directly into an approved container or
      into an approved instrument operated by a qualified technician, and </p>
    <p align="left" class="Doubleindent-quote" style="text-align:

      concentration of alcohol in the blood of the accused at the time when the
      offence was alleged to have been committed was, where the results of the
      analyses are the same, the concentration determined by the analyses and, where
      the results of the analyses are different, the lowest of the concentrations

    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    St. Pierre</i>,
    [1995] 1 S.C.R. 791. If applicable, the presumption of identity relieves the
    Crown from having to prove that the accused’s blood alcohol level at the time
    of the offence was the same as at the time of testing.  In those cases where the presumption of
    identity is not available, the accused’s blood alcohol level at the time of the
    offence must be proven in the ordinary way: see <i>R. v. Grosse</i> (1996), 107 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>

    258(1)(g) of the <i>Code </i>is also

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Absent a <i>Charter</i> application, where an accused has
    provided breath samples pursuant to a demand made under s. 254(3) of the <i>Code</i> in circumstances where the peace

    the opposite conclusion, as did the New Brunswick Court of Appeal in <i>R. v. Searle</i> (2006), 215 C.C.C. (3d) 374.
    As indicated, I am respectfully of the view that the trial judges answered the

    on September 9, 2005, Constable Labadat stopped Charette’s vehicle which he had
    noticed some two hours earlier parked at a local bar.  The officer smelled alcohol on Charette’s
    breath and Charette admitted to having consumed one beer. The officer then made
    a roadside demand and when Charette blew into the approved screening device, it
    registered an “F” for fail. Charette was arrested for driving “over 80” and a
    demand was made for samples of his breath. Charette later supplied two breath
    samples to a qualified technician, registering readings in each instance of
    130.</p>

    short trial in which he called no evidence and made no <i>Charter</i> applications. The Crown’s case consisted of Constable
    Labadat’s testimony and the certificate of analysis of the qualified
    technician, entered as an exhibit, establishing the amount of alcohol in
    Charette’s blood. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In his reasons for judgment, the trial judge observed
    that Constable Labadat had failed to “mention” why he “thought there were
    reasonable and probable grounds to believe that the defendant was committing an
    offence contrary to s. 253”. According to the trial judge, since there was
    “nothing in the officer’s evidence … that indicates what he believed was the
    significance of … failing … the roadside device test”, the Crown had failed to
    establish “the existence of a belief based on reasonable and probable grounds”
    as required for a valid demand under s. 254(3). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless, since Charette had not brought a <i>Charter</i> application to exclude the
    results of the breath test, the trial judge felt obliged to apply the
    presumption of identity in s. 258(1)(c) and to receive the Intoxilyzer readings
    without further evidence. In so concluding, he considered the Supreme Court of
    Canada’s decisions in <i>R. v. Rilling </i>(1975),
    24 C.C.C. (2d) 81 – a pre-<i>Charter </i>case
    in which the majority held that where an accused person is charged with driving
    “over 80”, the absence of reasonable and probable grounds to make the breath
    demand does not render the certificate inadmissible where the demand has been
    acceded to – and <i>R. v. Bernshaw</i> (1995), 95 C.C.C. (3d) 193 – where Cory J. writing for himself and two other
    judges stated in <i>obiter</i> that <i>Rilling </i>is still good law, and that,
    absent a <i>Charter </i>challenge to the
    admissibility of the results of a breath demand, the Crown need not establish
    the existence of reasonable and probable grounds.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Noting that the majority in <i>Bernshaw </i>did not discuss the continued applicability of <i>Rilling</i>, the trial judge concluded that <i>Rilling </i>still applied and that he was
    therefore bound to receive the Intoxilyzer readings and allow the presumption
    of identity in s. 258(1)(c) to operate.  Accordingly, he convicted Charette on the “over 80” charge. </p>

    reasonable and probable grounds to make the breath demands, the demands were
    invalid and the certificates should have been excluded. </p>

line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The summary conviction appeal judge rejected that
    argument.  He held that the majority
    judgment in <i>Rilling</i> continues to
    govern and that the existence of reasonable and probable grounds to make a
    demand under s. 254(3) is not an issue where an accused complies with the
    demand and does not move under the <i>Charter</i> to exclude the certificate.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, Charette and Tran pointed to the opening words
    of s. 258(1)(c) – “where samples of the breath of the accused have been taken
    pursuant to a demand made under subsection 254(3)…” – and argued that the
    reference to a “demand” must mean a valid demand, namely, one made by a peace
    officer who “believes on reasonable and probable grounds that a person is
    committing, or at any time within the preceding three hours has committed” an
    offence under s. 253.   Accordingly,
    Charette and Tran argued that since the Crown had failed to prove the existence
    of reasonable and probable grounds to make the breath demand, the Crown should
    not be entitled to rely on the presumption of identity under s. 258(1)(c).   </p>

    submission. In so concluding, he declined to follow <i>R. v. Boeck</i>, 2007 CanLII 14926, a decision in which Glass J. of the
    Ontario Superior Court of Justice had found that absent a <i>Charter</i> argument, <i>Rilling</i> “still applies” and “if the breath samples could be introduced into evidence,
    then the presumption [of identity] applies.” In refusing to adopt the latter
    proposition as a correct statement of the law, the summary conviction appeal
    judge stated at para. 12:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>With respect,
    that statement does not deal with or recognize Parliament’s words at the
    beginning of s. 258(1)(c), ‘… taken pursuant to a demand made under subsection

    certificate (probably properly so if <i>The
    Queen v. Rilling</i> has survived) with the statutory requirements of a
    discreet subsection dealing with a different thing, a practical evidentiary
    tool available, in certain circumstances, to the Crown. </p>

    that the certificate was still admissible under s.&nbsp;258(1)(g).  However, he declined to apply <i>Rilling </i>to what he called the

    the issue is whether, in the absence of a <i>Charter</i> application, the Crown may rely on the presumption of identity where samples of
    breath have been provided pursuant to a demand under s. 254(3) in circumstances
    where the officer making the demand did not have reasonable and probable
    grounds for doing so. I leave for another time whether the presumption of
    identity might factor into the s. 24(2) analysis, if at all, where an accused
    has challenged the admissibility of the test results and the court has found a
    s. 8 <i>Charter</i> breach on the basis that
    the arresting officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds to make the
    demand. I also leave open the question whether an accused who seeks to prevent
    the Crown from relying on the presumption of identity could possibly seek
    relief under s.&nbsp;24(1) of the <i>Charter</i> where a s. 8 breach has been established but the evidence of the test results

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>It is my opinion

    inadmissible certificate evidence in the case of a charge under s. 236 [now s.

    conviction, the majority of the court applied the presumption of identity as
    well as the presumption of accuracy. As noted, the case was a “certificate”

    intention of limiting those cases where the analysis could be proved by a
    certificate of a qualified technician and then that such analysis would provide <i>prima facie</i> proof of the proportion
    of alcohol in the blood of the accused only to those cases where the peace

    s. 258(1)(g) to those cases where the arresting officer had reasonable and
    probable grounds.  In contrast, the

    have concluded that just as reasonable and probable grounds for making a demand
    are irrelevant for purposes of s.&nbsp;258(1)(g) where an accused has acceded
    to the demand and provided samples, so too are those words irrelevant for
    purposes of s. 258(1)(c). The only other possibility, in the circumstances, is

    treated as irrelevant where an accused has complied with a demand and provided
    samples but treated as highly relevant in identical circumstances where what is
    at issue is the presumption of identity in s. 258(1)(c). As a matter of
    statutory interpretation, absent express language to the contrary, the same
    words in two subsections of the same provision should be treated alike,
    especially where as here, the provision is meant to provide a complete code for
    proceedings involving drinking and driving offences.  Giving the same words the same meaning
    throughout a statute is a basic principle of statutory interpretation: <i>R. v. Zeolkowski</i>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1378

    decision in <i>R. v. Gundy </i>(2008), 231
    C.C.C. (3d) 26.  In <i>Gundy, </i>one of the issues to be decided was whether the Crown was
    required to prove, as part of its case on a charge of “over 80”, that “the
    [arresting officer] had reasonable and probable grounds to make the Intoxilyzer
    demand”. Writing for the court, Rosenberg J.A. observed at para. 26 that the
    issue turned on whether reasonable and probable grounds are a pre-requisite to
    the admission of the Intoxilizer results, either by certificate [through the
    presumption of accuracy in s. 258(1)(g)] or through <i>viva voce</i> evidence, or a pre-requisite to the Crown being able to
    rely on the presumption of identity in s. 258(1)(c).  </p>

    argument in relation to it, Rosenberg J.A. referred at para. 28 to <i>Rilling</i>, noting that it “stands for the
    proposition that absence of reasonable and probable grounds does not affect the
    admissibility of the certificate.” After quoting the passage from Judson J.’s
    majority decision reproduced above at para. 35, Rosenberg J.A. made the
    following comments apposite to the issue at hand at para. 29:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left;'><span
lang=EN>The argument relating to the s. 258(1)(c)
    presumption runs along similar lines since the opening words are virtually
    identical:  ‘where samples of the breath
    of the accused have been taken pursuant to a demand made under subsection
    254(3)’.  It would seem to me that <i>Rilling</i> is a complete answer to that
    argument as well: see <i>R. v. Anderson</i>,
    [2005] O.J. No. 1900 (QL), 65 W.C.B. (2d) 466 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  In fact, in his dissent in <i>Rilling</i>, Spence&nbsp;J. drew no
    distinction between the admissibility of the certificate or the operation of
    the presumption, writing that proof of reasonable and probable grounds was a
    condition precedent with respect to both.  </span></p>

line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Later in his reasons, Rosenberg J.A. referred to the
    decision of the New Brunswick Court of Appeal in <i>R. v. Searle </i>(2006), 215 C.C.C. (3d) 374.  In that case, the accused, who was facing a
    charge of “over 80”, did not seek to exclude the breath test results, nor did
    he make a <i>Charter</i> argument. Rather,
    he argued that the Crown could not rely on the presumption of identity in s.
    258(1)(c) because the officer who demanded breath samples from him did not have
    reasonable and probable grounds to make a demand under s.&nbsp;254(3). Hence,
    the demand was unlawful and the presumption of identity was not triggered.  The Court of Appeal agreed with that
    submission. Its brief analysis of the issue is found at para. 25 as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>Since the demand
    was not made in strict compliance with s.&nbsp;254(3) of the <i>Code</i>, it is unlawful. The Crown cannot
    rely on the presumption found in s. 258(1)(c) unless the officer had reasonable
    and probable grounds to make the demand in the first place.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Gundy</i> at
    para.&nbsp;40, Rosenberg J.A. observed that the “<i>Searle</i> issue does not arise in this case”. Accordingly, he
    refrained from deciding it. However, in his concluding comments on <i>Searle</i>, he pointedly observed that “when
    the matter is before the court for decision, the effect of <i>Rilling</i> will have to be considered.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As <i>Gundy </i>makes
    clear, <i>Rilling</i> remains good law and
    it will continue to bind this court unless and until it is overturned by the
    Supreme Court of Canada or Parliament intervenes and changes the law. Until
    then, I see no reason why the opening words of s. 258(1)(c) – “where samples of
    breath of the accused have been taken pursuant to a demand made under
    subsection 254(3)” – should be interpreted any differently than the identical
    words in the opening of s. 258(1)(g).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am further satisfied that as a matter of policy and
    sound criminal procedure, the <i>Rilling </i>principle
    should apply equally to s. 258(1)(c) as it does to s. 258(1)(g). When one
    considers the carnage and destruction caused by impaired drivers, I do not
    think we should be promoting “trial by ambush” in “over 80” trials.  In <i>Gundy</i>,
    this court made it clear that the notice requirements for <i>Charter</i> applications should, as a rule, be adhered to and that non-<i>Charter</i> motions to exclude evidence
    should be raised before or when the evidence is proffered (see <i>Gundy</i> at paras.&nbsp;19-24 and 50). </p>

    accused is charged with driving “over 80”, the Crown need not concern itself
    with proving the existence of reasonable and probable grounds under s. 254(3)
    unless the accused brings a <i>Charter</i> application challenging the admissibility of the test results. While that will
    not change if the decision of the summary conviction appeal court judge stands,
    as a practical matter, it will be of no benefit to the Crown because in order
    to take advantage of the presumption of identity in s. 258(1)(c), the Crown
    will be obliged to establish reasonable and probable grounds in every “over 80”
    case, or risk having the charge dismissed. And because an attack on the
    presumption of identity does not technically involve an application to exclude
    evidence, it is at least arguable that an accused could wait until the end of
    the trial, after all of the evidence has been heard, before springing the trap
    and arguing that the presumption should not be available to the Crown because
    the arresting officer did not have reasonable and probable grounds for making a
    demand under s. 254(3).</p>

    in every case of driving “over 80”, the Crown would feel obliged to call all of
    the evidence available to it touching on the officer’s grounds for making the
    breath demand. And in those cases where the Crown could not be certain of
    obtaining a favourable finding, it would need to have a toxicologist on hand
    who could relate the readings back to the time of driving. In the Crown’s
    submission, these consequences would have a negative impact on a justice system
    that is already over-burdened, especially at the Ontario Court of Justice,
    where drinking and driving offences consume enormous amounts of time and
    resources.</p>

    results or prevent the Crown from relying on the presumption of identity, the
    Crown would not have to concern itself with the “reasonable and probable
    grounds” requirement in s. 254(3) to take advantage of the evidentiary shortcuts
    provided for in ss.&nbsp;258(1)(c) and (g) of the <i>Code</i>. Once an accused has acceded to a demand, the existence of
    reasonable and probable grounds under s. 254(3) should be immaterial. </p>

    than they were in the immediate aftermath of <i>Rilling</i>, i.e., before the advent of the <i>Charter</i>. In the period from 1975 to 1982, accused persons who
    acceded to a demand in circumstances where the arresting officer did not have
    reasonable and probable grounds were left without a remedy. But that changed
    with the arrival of the <i>Charter</i>. Now
    accused persons can challenge the admissibility of the test results under s. 8
    and seek to exclude those results under s. 24(2).</p>

    regime, the Crown will be alerted to the s. 8 breach and can prepare for it.  With the guesswork removed, the trial can then
    proceed in a more efficient, orderly and less costly fashion. As well, contrary
    to the view expressed by the trial judge in <i>Tran</i>,
    the <i>Charter</i>/<i>non-Charter</i> dichotomy involves more than “huge volumes of <i>Charter</i> materials that really are not
    necessary” since the finding of a s. 8 breach will not automatically result in
    the exclusion of evidence under s. 24(2). (See, for example, the comments of
    Weiler J.A. in <i>R. v.

    the learned summary conviction appeal judge erred in holding that in the
    absence of a <i>Charter</i> application,
    where an accused accedes to a demand under s. 254(3), the Crown must prove that
    the officer had reasonable and probable grounds for making the demand in order
    to rely on the presumption of identity in s. 258(1)(c) of the <i>Code</i>. Accordingly, I would grant leave
    to appeal in both instances, allow the appeals and restore the convictions
    registered against both respondents.</p>

    analysis, I question, without deciding, whether it was appropriate to order new
    trials.  I would have thought, in view of
    his analysis that there was no evidence of either Charette’s or Tran’s blood
    alcohol concentrations at the time of the alleged offences, acquittals should
    have been entered.</p>
