style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondent, Wayne Ryczak, was charged with
    the second degree murder of Stephine Beck.  He pleaded guilty to the lesser and included offence of manslaughter and
    was sentenced to 30 months imprisonment.  After credit on slightly more than a two for one basis, for 14 months
    and 10 days pre-trial custody, the net effective sentence imposed was one day
    imprisonment, to be followed by three years probation.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Crown seeks leave to appeal the sentence,
    arguing that it is unfit as it is allegedly outside the established range of
    sentences for similar manslaughter cases.  The Crown contends that an unfit sentence was imposed as a result of the
    following three errors by the sentencing judge: (i) the misapprehension by him
    of the respondent’s evidence of the unlawful act; (ii) his failure to
    appreciate the loss of sexual dignity arising from the condition in which the
    respondent left Ms. Beck’s body; and (iii) his failure to consider the impact
    of the crime given that Ms. Beck was 14 weeks pregnant at the time of her
    death.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For the reasons that follow, I do not agree that
    the sentence imposed is unfit or that the sentencing judge erred as asserted by
    the Crown.  Accordingly, I would grant
    leave to appeal sentence and dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h2>I.          Background</h2>
  <h2>            (1)       Circumstances of the Offence</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the early morning hours of March 4, 2007, the
    respondent left his house to pick up his son at work.  When he returned at about 3:30 a.m., he discovered
    Ms. Beck in his home, engaged in what appeared to be an attempted robbery.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondent testified at his sentencing
    hearing.  He said that immediately on
    entering his house, he was hit over the head with a lamp by Ms. Beck.  The sentencing judge accepted the
    respondent’s account of ensuing events, describing them as follows in his
    reasons for sentence: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>After hitting, or after
    being hit over the head with the lamp, Mr. Ryczak then was struck over the head
    by a glass or with a glass by Ms. Beck.  The glass broke.  Mr. Ryczak was
    successful in pushing the victim away and verbally tried to ascertain from her
    that she would calm down and not seek to perpetrate any further violence
    towards him.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>But I accept his
    evidence to the effect that despite such assurance she then came at him with a
    piece of the broken glass in her hand.  He then put his hands around her throat, holding her in that fashion and
    directed her over to the area of a couch.  She stopped breathing.  Mr. Ryczak
    tried to ascertain whether she was dead by ascertaining whether there appeared
    to be any breath coming out of her nose, which there was not.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>One of Mr. Ryczak’s neighbours later observed
    him outside of his home, loading a body into his car.  It is undisputed that Mr. Ryczak then drove
    Ms. Beck to a rural area and left her body in the snow.  When Ms. Beck’s body was discovered shortly
    thereafter, the clothing on the upper half of her body was raised up and the
    clothing on the lower half of her body was pulled down.  The sentencing judge accepted the respondent’s
    claim that the dislocation of Ms. Beck’s clothing was the result of his struggle
    to load and then unload her body from his car. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While there was no direct evidence that the
    respondent and Ms. Beck knew each other, the respondent acknowledged that they
    may have met before and that Ms. Beck may have been at his house on a previous
    occasion in the company of someone else.  There was no evidence of any prior relationship or of any animus between
    the respondent and Ms. Beck.  The
    sentencing judge found that Ms. Beck was in the respondent’s home on the night
    in question without the respondent’s prior knowledge or consent.</p>
  <h2>(2)       The Victim </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ms. Beck was 29 years old at the time of her
    death.  She was a sex trade worker who
    had a criminal record for offences that included assault and assault with a
    weapon.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>An autopsy was conducted on Ms. Beck’s body.  It revealed that she had sustained injuries
    to her neck, eyes and face as a result of the fatal altercation with the
    respondent.  The immediate cause of death
    was thought to be manual strangulation.  However, Ms. Beck also had a potentially lethal level of cocaine in her
    body at the time of her death.  In the
    opinion of the examining pathologist: (i) the cocaine ingested by Ms. Beck
    could, but need not, have proved fatal without any intervention by the
    respondent; (ii) the cocaine may have made Ms. Beck’s death by manual
    strangulation with the degree of force applied by the respondent more likely;
    and (iii) the degree of force utilized by the respondent would not necessarily
    cause death.</p>
  <h2>(3)       The Offender</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At the time of sentencing, the respondent was a
    55-year-old father and grandfather.  He had
    no prior criminal record and had been steadily employed for virtually his
    entire adult life.  He was well-regarded
    by his employer as a senior estimator with supervisory responsibilities in a
    construction firm.  He had also
    contributed to the community by serving as a member of a municipal Committee of
    Adjustments, was a Cub Scout leader for many years, and coached a minor league
    lacrosse team.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There was also evidence that the respondent had
    what his trial counsel termed “a shadow side” to his life.  He habitually associated with sex trade
    workers and admittedly had used non-prescription drugs on occasion and to
    excess.  But there was no evidence nor
    any suggestion that he had ever engaged Ms. Beck’s services as a prostitute, or
    that the offence charged involved sexual activity or drugs of any kind.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While the respondent was in custody, he was the
    victim of a serious assault at the hands of other inmates.  As a result of the assault, he lost four
    teeth and was placed in segregation.  He
    was subsequently transferred to another institution in another city, which
    prevented him from having frequent family contact while in custody.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The respondent also suffers from testicular
    cancer, which requires bi-yearly monitoring.  His dental problems, caused by the assault during his detention,
    continue.</p>
  <h2>II.        Issues</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The main issue on appeal is whether the sentence
    imposed is unfit since it allegedly falls outside the applicable range of
    sentences for manslaughter involving manual strangulation and the deliberate
    disposal of the victim’s body.  As I have
    said, the Crown submits that the sentencing judge erred in his sentencing
    analysis by: (i) mis-apprehending the respondent’s evidence of the altercation
    with Ms. Beck; (ii) failing to appreciate the loss of sexual dignity arising
    from the condition in which the respondent left Ms. Beck’s body; and (iii)
    failing to consider the impact of the crime given Ms. Beck’s pregnancy at the
    time of her death.  These errors, the
    Crown maintains, led to the imposition of a demonstrably unfit sentence.</p>
  <h2>III.       Analysis</h2>

    Sentences</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For several reasons, I would not accede to the
    Crown’s submission that the sentence received by the respondent is unfit on the
    ground that it falls outside the range of sentences applicable in a case of
    this kind.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First, the sentence imposed was a penitentiary
    sentence.  The sentencing judge, as he
    was entitled to do, credited the respondent with 30 months for 14 months and 10
    days pre-trial custody.  In so doing, he properly
    took account of the duration and conditions of the respondent’s pre-trial
    custody, including the assaultive incident and consequent segregation of the
    respondent.  The sentencing judge’s discretionary
    decision as to the amount of credit to be assigned to the respondent’s
    pre-trial custody attracts considerable deference from this court.  It is not challenged by the Crown on appeal.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second, while the Crown relies on several
    “strangulation manslaughter” cases in which sentences longer than that received
    by the respondent were imposed, those cases are factually distinguishable from
    this case in several respects.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As recognized by the sentencing judge, self-defence
    was a live issue in this case.  Nonetheless, the respondent pleaded guilty to manslaughter.  In these circumstances, it was open to the
    sentencing judge to attach considerable weight to the respondent’s relatively early
    guilty plea.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover, on the evidence in this case, it was
    not established that strangulation was the sole cause of death.  The pathology evidence demonstrated that the
    cocaine ingested by Ms. Beck was a complicating and potentially causative
    factor in her death.  There is no
    suggestion that the respondent knew or could have known of any particular
    vulnerability by Ms. Beck due to her consumption of a considerable quantity of
    cocaine.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally, unlike many of the cases relied on by
    the Crown, this was not a domestic abuse situation.  Nor did the offence involve a breach of trust,
    any planning or premeditation, or the use of any weapon by the respondent.  On the contrary, on the uncontested findings
    of the sentencing judge, the respondent was the victim of rapid and repeated
    violent attacks by Ms. Beck, involving the use of a lamp, a glass and a piece
    of glass as weapons.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third, and importantly, Crown counsel properly
    conceded during the course of oral argument before this court that the sentence
    imposed in fact is within the applicable range of sentences, albeit at the
    lower end of that range.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Fourth, the sentencing judge expressly adverted
    to the range of sentences advanced by the Crown and to the authorities relied
    on by the Crown in support of the asserted range.  He recognized that: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It is virtually
    impossible to ever find a precedent case that has exactly the same facts
    surrounding the events and the same facts surrounding the offender, and that
    impossibility shows itself in this case, as is the usual circumstance.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The sentencing judge also correctly observed
    that:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The circumstances that
    can constitute manslaughter can range over such a variety of circumstances that
    it is impossible to legislatively predict what the least amount of punishment
    should be.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The sentencing judge concluded, citing <i>R. v. Turcotte</i> (2000), 48 O.R. (3d) 97 (
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), at para.
    36, that the offence in this case was “committed under very specific difficult
    conditions unlikely to ever reoccur”.  That observation, with which I agree, is amply supported by the record.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover, the sentencing judge’s reliance on <i>Turcotte</i> was not misplaced.  In that case, this court made a clear
    statement about the range of sentences available in a manslaughter case, noting
    at para. 19 that, “[w]hile many, if not most, sentences for manslaughter are in
    the penitentiary range, maximum reformatory sentences are not unknown and are
    clearly within the acceptable range (citations omitted).”  Further, “[c]onditional sentences of that
    duration and, indeed, of shorter duration, have been passed against persons
    found guilty of manslaughter both in this province and elsewhere (citations
    omitted).”  See also <i>R. v. Simcoe</i> (2002), 156 O.A.C. 190 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), at para 14.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Fifth, the Crown’s claim that trial defence
    counsel recognized that a further term of two years imprisonment, in addition
    to the respondent’s pre-trial custody, was warranted in this case does not
    assist the Crown on appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At the sentencing hearing, the Crown asserted
    that the proper range of sentences in this case was between seven and ten years
    imprisonment.  The respondent’s trial
    counsel urged the imposition of a two-years less one day conditional
    sentence.  He also argued that if a
    conditional sentence was rejected, a two-year penitentiary sentence should be
    imposed.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As I read the transcript of defence counsel’s
    submissions on sentence, it was his position that given the particularly harsh
    circumstances of the respondent’s pre-trial custody, enhanced credit for
    pre-trial custody should be given to the respondent.  Defence counsel argued, in effect, that such
    enhanced credit would negate the need for a further term of imprisonment.  He then submitted, in the alternative, that
    if a custodial term of imprisonment was to be imposed, a penitentiary term
    should apply.  He explained:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The reason we ask for a
    penitentiary term, rather than a provincial term, is because of my client’s
    health problems.  What did not emerge
    during the course of, of the evidence, and it’s my fault completely, is that he
    has had a bout with testicular cancer, and requires ongoing medical care.  He has profound issues involving his teeth,
    because of the assault [during pre-trial custody].  And he has been advised by having made
    inquiries that the opportunity to obtain medical treatment is much swifter in
    the federal system.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus, as I understand his position, defence
    counsel argued first, that no further custodial term of imprisonment should be
    imposed once proper credit was assigned to the respondent’s pre-trial
    custody.  Next, and in the alternative,
    he submitted that any additional custodial term should be served in the
    penitentiary to accommodate the respondent’s serious health concerns.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The sentencing judge, of course, was not bound
    to accept the submissions of either party.  However, he did accept defence counsel’s argument that enhanced credit
    should be given for the respondent’s pre-trial custody.  Indeed, his reasons indicate that, on the
    facts of this case, he was prepared to give even greater credit for pre-trial
    custody than he ultimately awarded.  In
    his reasons, the sentencing judge said:  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[I]ndeed if it were
    necessary to my decision I would enhance the amount of pre-trial credit by
    virtue of the violence perpetrated on him while he was within…correction’s
    control and by virtue of the solitary confinement to which he was subjected,
    not as a result of any misbehaviour on his part.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ultimately, the sentencing judge rejected the
    defence request for a conditional sentence on the basis of what he viewed as
    the respondent’s “callous” and “inhumane” treatment of Ms. Beck’s body and the
    respondent’s failure to seek assistance from the police or medical authorities
    when Ms. Beck stopped breathing.  In the
    sentencing judge’s opinion, these serious aggravating factors compelled the
    rejection of a conditional sentence and the imposition of a penitentiary term.  I agree.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A 30-month penitentiary sentence was in fact imposed.  That sentence was effectively reduced to one
    day, having regard to the lengthy pre-trial custody served by the respondent in
    difficult circumstances that involved violence, serious and on-going personal
    injuries, and isolated and restrictive confinement.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In the end, there is simply no basis on which to
    conclude that the sentencing judge failed to consider the applicable sentencing
    principles, erred in their application to the facts of this case as he found
    them, or failed to appreciate the range of sentences established in
    manslaughter cases involving strangulation and disposal of the deceased’s
    body.  I would reject this ground of
    appeal.</p>
  <h2>(2)       Other Alleged Errors</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Nor do I accept that the sentencing judge
    otherwise erred as asserted by the Crown.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Crown submits that the sentencing judge
    erred in his appreciation of the respondent’s evidence of the altercation with
    Ms. Beck.  In particular, the Crown
    asserts that the respondent’s evidence indicated that he responded to Ms.
    Beck’s “advances” with “two separate strangulations”.  The Crown says that, contrary to the
    sentencing judge’s findings, the respondent was not struck with the glass
    directly after he was hit by the lamp and he did not push Ms. Beck away at any
    point in time.  Rather, after he was
    struck with the lamp, the respondent held Ms. Beck by the throat with
    sufficient force to prevent her from speaking and then let her go after this
    “first strangulation”.  According to the
    Crown, only thereafter was the respondent hit by the glass, whereupon he “pushed
    her towards the couch as he strangled her again”, with greater force.  The Crown maintains that the sentencing judge
    misapprehended the respondent’s evidence of this chronology of events, key
    aspects of the altercation and the degree of force applied in the “strangulations”.  I disagree.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In his evidence, which the sentencing judge
    accepted, the respondent described two applications of force to Ms. Beck’s
    neck.  Contrary to the Crown’s
    contention, the respondent testified that the first application was
    discontinued when Ms. Beck “acknow-ledged she was gonna be a, behave, so I let
    her go”.  He then said, “I backed up, she
    came at me, I was over by the door.  I
    kind of grabbed her again by the throat, took a step at her and grabbed rather
    a little more forcefully and pushed her towards the couch.  By the time she got to the couch she just
    collapsed.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This was a relatively short sentencing
    hearing.  The sentencing judge delivered
    his reasons the day after hearing the respondent’s evidence.  Thus, the respondent’s testimony would have
    been fresh in the sentencing judge’s mind.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In his reasons, the sentencing judge described the
    respondent’s evidence, including the sequence of events outlined by him in his
    testimony, in only brief compass.  However,
    the reasons reveal that the sentencing judge had a firm grasp of the
    respondent’s evidence.  In particular,
    when the reasons are read as a whole, it is clear that the sentencing judge
    understood that separate applications of manual pressure to the deceased’s neck
    were applied by the respondent and that the force used by him was
    excessive.  The sentencing judge observed
    in his reasons that Ms. Beck attacked the respondent not once, but a total of
    three times, and that the respondent’s guilty plea confirmed his acknowledgement
    that he used excessive force in responding to Ms. Beck.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although the sentencing judge did not elaborate on
    the degree of force used by the respondent to repel each of Ms. Beck’s attacks,
    or set out in detail the respondent’s exact description of the events at his
    home, the reasons demonstrate that the sentencing judge appreciated the core of
    the respondent’s evidence – that manual strangulation occurred and that the
    amount of force used was ultimately excessive.  In my view, on this record, the Crown’s contention that the sentencing
    judge misapprehended the respondent’s evidence is unsustainable.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I would also reject the Crown’s complaints that
    the sentencing judge erred by failing to appreciate the loss of dignity to Ms.
    Beck arising from the condition in which the respondent left her body and by
    failing to take into account the fact that Ms. Beck was pregnant at the time of
    her death.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The sentencing judge held that the respondent’s
    disposal of Ms. Beck’s body was “callous”, “uncaring” and “inhumane”.  He regarded it as “certainly an aggravating
    factor” to be considered on sentencing.  As I have said, it was the respondent’s treatment of the body, coupled
    with his failure to seek assistance when Ms. Beck stopped breathing, that led
    the sentencing judge to conclude that a penitentiary sentence was required in
    this case.  In my opinion, it was
    inherent to the sentencing judge’s strong condemnation of the respondent’s
    callous acts that he recognized the impact of those acts on Ms. Beck’s human
    dignity.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There is also no basis on which to fault the
    sentencing judge for his failure to expressly mention Ms. Beck’s pregnancy at
    the time of her death.  There is no
    evidence that the respondent knew that Ms. Beck was pregnant.  Indeed, there is no evidence that Ms. Beck
    herself was aware of her pregnancy.  No
    questions on this issue were put to the respondent during cross-examination by
    Crown counsel at trial.  It is also
    telling that Crown counsel did not assert that Ms. Beck’s pregnancy was an
    aggravating factor to be taken into account on sentencing.  Indeed, the Crown made no mention of this
    fact at all in her sentencing submissions.  In these circumstances, I would not give effect to this ground of
    appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I note that in its appeal factum, the Crown also
    complained that the sentencing judge failed to mention the victim impact
    statement of Ms. Beck’s mother.  This
    complaint was not pursued by the Crown in oral argument.  In any event, the sentencing judge was not
    required to explicitly list every piece of evidence considered by him in
    crafting his sentence.  There is nothing
    in his reasons to support the conclusion that he failed to consider the victim
    impact statement.  On the contrary, his reasons
    reveal a sensitive and explicit recognition of the value and importance of Ms.
    Beck’s life and of the tragedy occasioned by its loss.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I conclude with this observation.  The sentencing judge emphasized in his
    reasons that, “[t]his is not a case, whatsoever, of anyone preying upon a sex
    trade worker or of anyone committing violence towards a sex trade worker
    engaged in that profession.”  He also
    said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Whatever Ms. Beck’s
    [antecedents] may be, they are of no relevance or interest to me in this
    sentencing, in that her attendance at Mr. Ryczak’s home had nothing whatsoever
    to do with any life choices she may have made, other than the fact she chose to
    be in another individual’s home with no lawful purpose or reason or excuse for
    being there on the day in question.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>I agree.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This case concerns the tragic loss of the life
    of a woman who was unlawfully in the respondent’s home, who the sentencing
    judge found on the evidence “must have been there to steal something”, and who
    repeatedly attacked the respondent without provo-cation.  In fashioning a just sentence, this
    experienced sentencing judge indicated that he had attempted to meet the aims
    of the sentencing principles dictated by the <i>Criminal Code</i> without in any way suggesting a lack of value to Ms.
    Beck’s life.  This was both appropriate
    and necessary.</p>
