  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was convicted by a jury of: (1) sexual
    assault with a weapon; (2) unlawful confinement; and (3) theft under
    $5,000.  He was 37 years old at the time
    of the offences and had a very lengthy criminal record.  These convictions represent his 28<sup>th</sup>,
    29<sup>th</sup> and 30<sup>th</sup> convictions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The complainant, a complete stranger to him, was 15
    years old.  After convincing her to drive
    with him to a secluded area outside the small town in which she lived, he bound
    her hands with a bungee cord, held a knife to her throat and took her into the
    bush where he kept her for approximately ten hours.  In that time, he sexually assaulted the
    complainant some 14 times.  The assaults
    included repeatedly forcing her to perform oral sex and numerous acts of
    unprotected anal and vaginal intercourse.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When he was finished, the appellant stole all the money
    that the complainant had in her purse.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One of the appellant’s prior convictions is for a
    sexual assault with very similar facts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant was given an effective sentence of 10
    years in addition to 30 months of pre-sentence custody credited at a rate of
    approximately 1:5 to 1.  The sentence is
    composed of 9 ½ years for sexual assault with a weapon; 2 ½ years for unlawful confinement,
    consecutive to the other sentences; and 6 months for theft under $5,000,
    consecutive to the other sentences.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing judge ordered that parole be delayed, with
    the result that the appellant must serve half of the sentences imposed on
    counts 1 and 2 before he can be released on full parole.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant seeks leave to appeal sentence and, if granted,
    asks that the sentence be varied so that the sentences are concurrent rather
    than consecutive, “2 for 1” pre-sentence custody credit is given, and the order
    for delayed parole is quashed.  He raises
    three grounds of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the appellant contends that the sentencing judge
    erred in ordering consecutive sentences because the offences were all part of
    the same transaction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We disagree.  The
    decision to order concurrent or consecutive sentences should be treated with
    the same deference that appellate courts owe to sentencing judges concerning
    the length of sentences ordered: <i>R. v.
    McDonnell</i> [1997], 1 S.C.R. 948 at para. 46.  It was open to the sentencing judge to order consecutive sentences
    because the offences “constitute invasions of different legally protected
    interests”: see <i>R. v. Gummer</i> (1983),
    1 OAC 141 (C.A.) at para. 13.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the appellant argues that he should have been
    given 2 for 1 credit for his pre-sentence custody and that the sentencing judge
    failed to consider evidence as to the conditions of the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Owen Sound jail where the appellant served
    his pre-sentence custody. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The amount of credit to be given for pre-sentence
    custody is a matter within the discretion of the sentencing judge.  One of the considerations in granting 2 for 1
    credit for pre-sentence custody is that such time does not count towards
    parole.  The sentencing judge gave a cogent
    reason for reducing the usual 2 for 1 credit to approximately 1.5 to 1 credit,
    namely, that the appellant was unlikely to qualify for early parole.  This court has indicated that such a
    consideration is valid: see <i>R. v. Francis</i> (2006), 207 C.C.C. (3d) 536 at para. 23.  Given that the appellant is a violent recidivist who has previously
    violated parole and court orders, no objection can be taken to the reasoning of
    the sentencing judge that the appellant is unlikely to obtain early parole.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing judge requested the evidence that was
    adduced in relation to the conditions of the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Owen Sound jail.  Although he did not refer to that evidence in
    his reasons, he stated that he had considered it.  We accept that he did so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The third ground of appeal relates to the order for
    delayed parole.  The appellant argues
    that the sentencing judge was biased because, prior to the sentencing, the sentencing
    judge became aware that the appellant had filed a complaint against him with
    the Canadian Judicial Council.  The appellant
    also argues that the sentencing judge erred and became an advocate for the
    Crown by advising the Crown that he was considering an order for delayed
    parole.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We accept neither submission.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We see nothing in the submission that the sentencing
    judge was biased because of the complaint that had been filed against him.  At the outset of delivering his reasons for
    sentence, the sentencing judge acknowledged that the complaint had been
    filed.  He assured the appellant that the
    action would have no influence on his determination of a fit sentence.  We accept that the sentencing judge so
    conducted himself.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The sentencing judge was entitled to consider delayed
    parole and did so in accordance with the dictates of <i>R. v. Zinck</i> (2003), 171 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.) at paras. 33-36.  After raising the issue on his own motion,
    the sentencing judge granted the parties an adjournment so that they could
    adequately address the issue, made clear that he had not formed any conclusions
    about whether the order was warranted, and conveyed that he viewed it as an
    extraordinary measure.  Nothing in these
    circumstances gives rise to concerns about bias, as the appellant suggests.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, on this record, as the sentencing judge
    identified, denunciation, deterrence and the need for protection of the public
    justified such an order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the schedule listing the offences that may be subject
    to delayed parole, when the legislator wanted to limit the application of the
    delayed parole provision to part of a section, the schedule so specifies. By
    contrast, when the entire section is meant to be subject to the delayed parole
    provision, only the section is referenced. It is not broken down by
    subsection.  Here section 279 is
    specified in its entirety without discrimination between its various
    subsections.  Furthermore, section 3 of
    the <i>Criminal Code</i> states that descriptive
    cross-references are inserted for ease of reference only. See also<i> R. v. Pritchard </i>[2008] 3 S.C.R. 195 at
    para. 25. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We acknowledge that the principle of totality must be
    kept in mind when reviewing the overall sentence.  In our view, the overall sentence is not
    demonstrably unfit, given the nature and number of assaults, the seriousness of
    the offences, the victim’s age, the appellant’s record and the total absence of
    mitigating factors.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, leave to appeal sentence is granted but
    the sentence appeal is dismissed.</p>
