    seeks to set aside the order of the Registrar dismissing its appeal for delay
    and to extend the time for perfecting its appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Background</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    events that give rise to this litigation go back 20 years.  In 1988, Mladenov retained the responding parties
    (Beak) as environmental consultants on property that it owned.  In 2000, Mladenov sued Beak.  It claimed that Beak overstated the amount of
    PCB contamination on the property, thus preventing Mladenov from selling it. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Beak
    moved for summary judgment to dismiss the action on the ground that it had not
    been started within the applicable limitation period of six years.  On March 14, 2008 Sosna J. granted summary
    judgment.  He held that by 1992 at the
    latest Mladenov had all the facts needed to sue Beak.  Yet it waited eight years to do so.  Sosna J. therefore held that Mladenov’s
    action was statute-barred.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mladenov
    filed a notice of appeal on time but took no steps to perfect it.  The record shows a disagreement over whether
    Mladenov’s previous lawyer was retained to perfect the appeal or only to file a
    notice of appeal.  On June 12, 2008 the
    Registrar of this court dismissed the appeal for delay.  In late 2008, Mladenov’s current lawyer was
    retained to bring this motion.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    overriding question on the motion is whether the justice of the case calls for
    setting aside the Registrar’s order and permitting Mladenov to pursue its
    appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mladenov
    has not satisfactorily explained its delay of eight months in moving the set
    aside the Registrar’s order; and its inaction after filing its notice of appeal
    raises doubt whether it maintained a serious ongoing intention to appeal.  These failings by themselves may not preclude
    the relief Mladenov seeks.  I agree with
    Ms. Batner, counsel for Beak, however, that the decisive consideration on this
    motion is the lack of merit in the appeal.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    summary judgment dismissing the action did not depend on resolving questions of
    credibility.  Nor was it based on
    disputed facts.  It was based on the
    December 2007 discovery evidence of Peter Mladenov, the principal of the moving
    party.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr.
    Mladenov testified that as early as 1989 he believed that Beak had overstated
    the amount of PCB contamination on his company’s property.  In February 1992, Mr. Mladenov retained Bruce
    Brown, an expert on PCB contamination.  Mr. Brown confirmed Mr. Mladenov’s belief.  Mr. Mladenov therefore acknowledged that by
    March 1992, he knew everything he needed to know to sue Beak.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Q.        So by the time you went to the meeting
    with Bruce Brown in March 1992, to use your words, you already knew there was
    something very, very wrong with the Beak report?</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>A.        That is right…</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:
center;'><span lang=EN-US>…</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Q.        So an expert on PCBs, somebody you
    sought out for an opinion, told you that Beak’s report was wrong and
    exaggerated?</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>A.        Right.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Q.        And you knew at that Beak’s report was a
    problem for you in terms of cleaning up the property?</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>A.        I knew that before, way before.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Q.        So
    you knew since 1989?</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>A.        But
    I had somebody now to confirm it.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Q.        So Bruce Brown confirmed your belief
    held as early as 1989, that Beak’s report was wrong and exaggerate the PCB
    problem?</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>A.        Exactly. </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Q.        And
    he was the big expert in the field?</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>A.        Yes.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Q.        So that gave you a lot of comfort in
    knowing you were right and Beak was wrong about the PCB circumstances?</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>A.        Right.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:
center;'><span lang=EN-US>…</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Q.        Just to return, then, to the issue of
    Bruce Brown, it is fair to say, I take it, that what you are now saying in this
    action is exactly what Bruce Brown told you and what you knew before and he
    confirmed; is that fair?</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>A.        Yes.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>When
    asked why he did not sue Beak earlier, Mr. Mladenov replied that he was busy and
    distracted by other matters.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
    this motion, Mr. Mladenov attempts to avoid the effect of his acknowledgement
    on discovery by pointing out that Mr. Brown’s report to him was not in
    writing.  He contends that another
    consultant’s 1994 report was the first written report supporting his claim
    against Beak.  But the application of the
    discoverability rules do not depend on whether the information needed to start
    a claim is in writing.  Here, by 1992, on
    his own evidence, Mr. Mladenov knew all the material facts on which his claim
    was based.  I therefore see no merit in
    Mr. Mladenov’s appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
    add that the 1994 consultant’s report, which Mladenov relies on, did not
    suggest that Beak had been negligent.  And
    even on this motion, Mladenov has not filed an expert report that questions
    whether Beak met the standard of care required of it. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
    facts giving rise to Mladenov’s lawsuit occurred many years ago.  I see no arguable ground of appeal from the
    motion judge’s finding that the lawsuit was started after the limitation period
    had expired.  The justice of the case
    entitles Beak to finality. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The

    $4,000, inclusive of disbursements and GST.</span></p>
