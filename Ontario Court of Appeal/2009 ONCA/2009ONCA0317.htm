    the judgment of Moore J. of the Superior Court of Justice, sitting with a jury,
    dated September 8, 2008, concerning a motor vehicle accident which occurred on
    June 8, 2000, involving the respondent, Robert Marcoccia, and Bhupinder Singh
    Gill, the driver of the truck owned by the appellant.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

    respondent was 39% at fault and Gill was 61% at fault for the accident.  The jury assessed the respondent’s damages at
    $312,000 for pain and suffering, $5,322.73 for past income loss, $1,384,918 for
    future income loss, and $13,952,064 for future cost of care.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant contests the findings made by the jury in
    respect of the apportionment of liability and damages for future cost of
    care.  The appellant also seeks leave to
    appeal the trial judge’s costs award of $720,000 and, if leave is granted,
    seeks a reduction of that award.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>II.        <u>FACTS</u></span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>A.        The accident and the respondent’s
    injuries</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The basic facts in this case are relatively
    simple.  The accident took place in the
    City of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto
    on the evening of June 8, 2000, at the right-angled intersection of
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Rexdale Blvd. and
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Humberwood Blvd.  Rexdale runs east and west and Humberwood
    runs north and south.  Rexdale is a
    through street.  Humberwood ends at
    Rexdale at a “T” intersection.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent was travelling west along Rexdale,
    intending to continue on through the intersection.  He was in the left-most lane as he neared the
    intersection at Humberwood.  As he
    approached the intersection, the traffic light turned amber.  He initially slowed down, but then sped up
    over the speed limit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At this time, Gill had entered the intersection on the
    amber light and was stopped in the left turn lane waiting to turn left from
    Rexdale onto Humberwood.  As the light
    turned red, Gill started to turn slowly into the intersection.  He did not notice the respondent approach the
    intersection or run the red light.  An
    instant later, the respondent’s car collided with Gill’s van, seriously
    injuring the respondent. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At the time of the accident, the respondent was 20 years
    old and had just finished grade 12.  He
    suffered serious injuries to the frontal and temporal lobes of his brain in the
    accident.  As a result, he suffers from
    diminished executive functioning, has enduring physical, psychological,
    behavioural, and emotional impairments that impede his ability to lead a normal
    life, and cannot be competitively employed in the future.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent brought an action for damages against
    Gill and Gill’s employer, Purba Furniture Ltd., as well as against the
    appellant.  Gill and Purba Furniture Ltd.
    settled with the respondent before trial.  The appellant defended the action.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>B.        The parties’ positions at trial
    regarding liability and damages</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At trial, the appellant asserted that the respondent
    was far from the intersection when the traffic light turned amber and that it
    was amber for a full five seconds before the respondent reached the
    intersection.  The respondent could
    easily have slowed down to stop at the light.  Instead of slowing down, however, the respondent sped up in an attempt
    to beat the light.  When the light turned
    red, the respondent ran the red and collided with Gill, who had just begun his
    left turn.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent, on the other hand, asserted that he was
    very close to the intersection when the light turned amber.  Gill therefore could and should have seen him
    coming.  The respondent misjudged his
    ability to clear the intersection on the amber light and entered the
    intersection on the red light.  Because Gill’s
    van moved out in front of him in the intersection, the vehicles collided.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>C.        The jury’s findings and disposition
    regarding liability and damages</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The jury found that the respondent entered the
    intersection “on the red light”.  It
    concluded that the respondent was 39% at fault for doing so, contributing to
    the accident, and that Gill was 61% at fault for failing to ensure that his
    left turn could be negotiated safely, causing the accident.  The jury assessed the respondent’s damages at
    $312,000 for pain and suffering, $5,322.73 for past income loss, and $1,384,918
    for future income loss.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The jury also assessed the respondent’s damages for
    future cost of care at $13,952,064, which amounted to roughly 96% of the
    highest schedule of future care costs claimed by the respondent.  This award envisioned the respondent living independently
    with provision for extensive support and services.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two other situations were considered but ultimately rejected
    by the jury: the respondent advanced the option of residence and treatment at
    CHIRS (Community Head Injury Resources Services of Ontario), a residential
    rehabilitation facility, which would have cost $9,589,302 but had an 11-year
    waiting list; and, the appellant advanced the option of a semi-independent
    living arrangement preceded by a two year period of intensive rehabilitation in
    a rehabilitation facility and a one year transition period in a
    semi-independent living environment, which would have cost $2,173,000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant appeals from the jury’s findings
    regarding both liability and damages in respect of the respondent’s future care
    costs.  The appellant also seeks leave to
    appeal, and a reduction of, the trial judge’s costs award of $720,000.</p>

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>IV.       <u>ANALYSIS</u></span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>A.        Liability</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The essence of the appellant’s submission on the
    liability issue is two-fold: first, the 61%:39% (appellant: Gill) apportionment
    of fault between the two drivers was perverse and illogical; and, second, this
    conclusion was the direct result of serious deficiencies in the trial judge’s
    charge to the jury in relation to the apportionment of liability.  For the reasons that follow, we do not accept
    either component of the appellant’s submission.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>1. The
    jury’s allocation of fault was not “plainly unreasonable and unjust”</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant asserts that it is a well-recognized
    principle that drivers are entitled to reasonably expect that other drivers
    will respect the prohibition against entering an intersection on a red
    light.  The appellant submits that,
    accordingly, in light of the jury’s finding that the respondent had run the red
    light in breach of his traffic obligations and the duty of care owed to Gill
    and other drivers, its conclusion that Gill was 61% liable is illogical and
    perverse.   According to the appellant,
    the jury’s conclusion is also perverse given the supporting evidence that the
    light had been amber for a full five seconds before the respondent reached the
    intersection, that he could have stopped safely, and that he was driving over
    the speed limit when he struck Gill’s van.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not accept this submission.  The standard of review of a jury verdict in a
    civil case is well-established.  An
    appellate court may interfere with a jury’s verdict only where “it is so <i>plainly unreasonable and unjust</i> as to
    satisfy the court that no jury reviewing the evidence as a whole and acting
    judicially could have reached it” (emphasis added): see <i>Snushall v. Fulsang</i> (2005), 78 O.R. (3d) 142 (C.A.), at para. 19,
    citing <i>Vancouver-Fraser Park District v.
    Olmstead</i>, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 831, at p. 838.  As explained by this court in <i>McIntyre
    v. Grigg </i>(2006), 83 O.R. (3d) 161, at para. 38, “in the absence of a
    material misdirection or non-direction” by the trial judge in his or her charge
    to the jury, an appellate court will not disturb a jury’s apportionment
    decision unless “no jury reviewing the evidence as a whole and acting
    judicially could have arrived at that conclusion.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant has not persuaded us that the jury’s
    allocation of fault in this case clears the high hurdle described above.  In our view, the jury’s apportionment of fault
    as between Gill (61%) and the respondent (39%) does not meet this “exacting
    standard for appellate intervention”: see <i>Kerr
    v. Loblaws</i> (2007), 224 O.A.C. 56, at para. 46.  It is clear from the record that both drivers
    committed major blunders that led directly to the disastrous accident and the
    respondent’s injuries – the respondent ran a red light, and Gill did not keep a
    proper lookout.  They collided as a
    result of both their errors.  Both were
    indisputably at fault.  The jury’s
    attribution of negligence to both drivers was therefore entirely
    reasonable.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This determination then required the jury to apportion
    the fault between them.  A 61%:39%
    apportionment recognizes that both drivers were at fault to a substantial
    degree.  The jury heard and saw all the
    evidence in a lengthy trial and did precisely what it was entitled to do –
    exercise its collective common sense and judgment and attempt to reach a fair
    result.  In our view, the jury’s
    apportionment of liability in this case simply does not attract the perverse
    and unreasonable labels promoted by the appellant; the jury’s apportionment was
    not “so plainly unreasonable and unjust as to satisfy the court that no jury
    reviewing the evidence as a whole and acting judicially could have reached it”: <i>Snushall </i>at para. 19.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>2. The trial
    judge’s charge to the jury regarding liability was not deficient</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant asserts that the jury’s perverse
    apportionment of liability resulted from a deficient charge to the jury by the
    trial judge in relation to liability.  According to the appellant, the trial judge’s charge was general, vague,
    confusing, and unhelpful.  The appellant
    submits that the trial judge not only failed to relate the legal obligations of
    the drivers and the law of negligence to the theories of liability that were
    advanced by each party, but also misdirected the jury as to the relevant
    obligations and permissible expectations of these drivers under the <i>Highway Traffic Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c.
    H.8. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In particular, the appellant submits that the trial
    judge erred in failing to instruct the jury that Gill was entitled to assume
    that the respondent would abide by the rules of the road and obey the red
    light: see <i>Zurevinski v. P &amp; G
    Construction Co</i>. (1987), 15 M.V.R. (2d) 281 (Ont. Dist. Ct.), at paras. 17
    – 19, citing <i>Chatten v. Armstrong</i>,
    [1968] 1 O.R. 497 (C.A.), at p. 499.  The
    appellant further submits that although its trial counsel did not object to the
    impugned portions of the charge, this does not preclude the appellant from
    relying on the misdirection, especially where the errors bore directly on the
    jury’s central task – the apportionment of liability.  In other words, the absence of an objection
    at trial is not fatal to this ground of appeal.  The appellant submits that these errors render it uncertain that the
    jury would have returned with the same verdict had the errors not occurred.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We see nothing in the trial judge’s jury charge in
    relation to liability that introduces any element of fragility into the jury’s
    conclusion, nor into our assessment thereof.  The trial judge expressly instructed the jury that they could use the <i>Highway Traffic Act </i>and the associated
    rules of the road “as indicators of a reasonable standard of conduct that
    drivers could and should govern themselves by at intersections controlled by
    traffic signals.”  He cautioned the jury,
    however, not to use the provisions of the <i>Highway
    Traffic Act </i>“to establish liability for offences under the Act” but instead
    simply for assistance in determining the standard of care applicable to the
    drivers in the circumstances of this case.  He also carefully reiterated and explained the sections of the <i>Highway Traffic Act </i>pertinent to the issue
    of liability.  He concluded this
    component of the charge by reminding the jury “to apportion [liability]
    according to [their] best sense of fairness and justice upon the evidence as
    [they] find it.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the trial judge’s charge in relation to
    liability was comprehensive, clear, fair, and balanced.  There was no “material misdirection or non-direction”
    by the trial judge that warrants appellate intervention.  Further, although not determinative, the
    absence of any objections to the charge by an experienced trial counsel
    supports this assessment.  In our view,
    the trial judge’s instructions to the jury in relation to liability provided
    genuine assistance, not confusion, in a difficult case.  We therefore would not give effect to the
    appellant’s submissions to the contrary.  </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also contests the jury’s assessment of
    damages in the amount of almost $14 million for the respondent’s future care
    costs.  This amount represented
    approximately 96% of the maximum amount claimed by the respondent.  The appellant submits that this amount is
    “perverse and wholly unreasonable” and greatly exceeds any known award for
    future care costs in a brain damage or personal injury case in

    including cases that involve full paraplegic plaintiffs.  Further, the appellant submits that this
    perverse award resulted directly from the trial judge’s inadequate and
    erroneous jury charge in relation to future care costs.  In particular, the appellant asserts that the
    trial judge erred in his charge to the jury in the following ways:</p>
  <blockquote>

      damages for future care costs should be based only on what is “reasonably
      necessary” on the medical evidence to promote the mental and physical health of
      the plaintiff and that he failed to properly “unpack” what reasonableness
      means; and </p>

      erroneous in the sense that he did not instruct the jury that they were
      permitted to combine elements of the different scenarios put to them by the
      respondent, contrary to the decision of this court in <i>Sandhu v. Wellington Place Apartments </i>(2008), 234 O.A.C. 200, at
      paras. 17 and 19.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We would not give effect to the appellant’s submissions

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>1. The

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 119 of the <i>Courts
    of Justice Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, provides that “[o]n an appeal from an
    award for damages for personal injury, the court may, if it considers it just,
    substitute its own assessment of the damages.”  As noted above with respect to a jury’s apportionment of liability,
    appellate intervention regarding a jury’s damages assessment is justified only
    where the damages award “is so <i>plainly
    unreasonable and unjust</i> as to satisfy the court that no jury reviewing the
    evidence as a whole and acting judicially could have reached it” (emphasis
    added): see <i>Snushall </i>at para.
    19.  In the same vein, a jury’s decision
    on the apportionment of damages can be disturbed only in “exceptional
    circumstances”: see <i>Jones v. Niklaus</i> (2008), 240 O.A.C. 43, at para. 43, citing <i>Deshane
    v. Deere &amp; Co.</i> (1993), 15 O.R. (3d) 225 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">

    ), at para. 43, and <i>Jack v. Kirkrude</i> (2002), 155 O.A.C. 28, at
    para. 3. This court must thus accord considerable deference to a jury’s damages
    assessment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel for the appellant stated in oral
    submissions that the appellant was not advancing on appeal its trial position
    regarding damages, which amounted to just over $2M.  The appellant confirmed that the
    appropriate damages award in this case would therefore lie somewhere above
    $9.5M and below $14M, the two options advanced by the respondent at trial.  The appellant submitted that the jury’s
    almost $14M damages award was “way out of the park” and characterized it as
    “perverse and wholly unreasonable”.  Before
    us, the appellant further argued that the $14M option left with the jury was
    based on much duplication and unrealistic assumptions.  It conceded, however, that a lower award in
    the range of $11M would have been reasonable, albeit at the upper end of the
    range of reasonableness.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the jury’s assessment of damages in this
    case was not “plainly unjust and unreasonable”.   Rather, it was based on expert
    evidence properly adduced at trial. No evidence was led at trial with respect
    to the alleged overlap in the calculations advanced by the respondent’s expert.
    Although the parties’ experts disagreed as to assumptions relating to the
    appropriate level and length of care required, it was open to the jury to
    prefer the respondent’s expert on these points.  Further, the jury did not simply adopt the
    figures advanced by the respondent’s expert.  Substantial reductions were effected to many
    of the claims, including a reduction in the claim for future care costs.
    Accordingly, this court has no basis upon which to interfere with the jury’s
    assessment of damages.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>2. The trial
    judge’s jury charge in relation to future care costs was sufficient</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In any event, the trial judge’s instructions to
    the jury in relation to future care costs were neither inadequate nor
    erroneous, as the appellant suggests they were.  While the trial judge did not expressly delineate the meaning of
    reasonableness, he instructed the jury on multiple occasions that their
    findings needed to be grounded in “evidence [they] accept as being
    reasonable.”  Based on this instruction,
    it is implicit that if the jury determined that an item or scenario was justified on the evidence, by definition, it must
    be reasonable.  Moreover, the trial judge
    emphasized that “[t]he award must be fair to all parties” and that “[f]airness
    to the parties is achieved by assuring that the claims are legitimate and
    justifiable” on the evidence.  Accordingly, it cannot be said that the trial judge’s charge was
    inadequate for failing to more comprehensively “unpack” what reasonableness entailed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellant also submits that the trial judge
    erroneously failed to instruct the jury that they were not obligated simply to
    accept the scenarios advanced by the respondent; instead, the trial judge
    should have expressly instructed the jury that they were permitted to combine
    scenarios.  The appellant relies on the
    following statement from <i>Sandhu </i>at
    para. 17:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Juries are told they
    may accept some, none or all of the witnesses’ evidence. This jury was not
    obliged to accept only one of the scenarios presented by counsel by way of
    example. They were free to make their own calculation, provided that the
    calculation was based on the evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We do not accept the appellant’s submission in this
    regard.  While the trial judge did not
    come up with a specific combined scenario to put to the jury, the following
    excerpts illustrate that he did expressly instruct the jury that they were
    permitted to deviate from the scenarios advanced by the respondent at trial:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Remember that the onus
    is on the plaintiff to establish that a future pecuniary loss is a real
    possibility.  Each party bears an onus of
    establishing that the model or models they present to value a given future
    pecuniary loss, is realistic and reasonable.  Yours must be a reasoned analysis grounded in evidence before you.  <i>If the
    models given to you by Mr. Seigel or Dr. Charette do not assist you or persuade
    you, you must develop a different, yet fair and reasoned analysis of your own</i>.</p>
  <p align=center style='
text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is not necessary
    that you accept one side’s entire proposal, although you may well decide to do
    so.  I want you to understand this, that
    you need not accept the entire menu of damages proposed by the defendants, or
    the entirety of what is proposed by the plaintiff.  For example, there may be a part of the
    future care cost claim that you conclude is not fair and reasonable.  This does not mean that you must reject the
    plan in its entirety.  However, there
    must be a base of evidence that you have accepted to support whatever amounts
    you do decide to assess these future claims at. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More importantly, the appellant did not devise a
    specific combined scenario at trial, nor did it ask the jury to consider
    combining the scenarios advanced by the parties.  Counsel for the appellant presumably made a
    strategic decision not to do so in order to convey to the jury the appellant’s
    position that the scenarios advanced by the respondent were inappropriate –
    scenario one ($14M) because it was excessive, and scenario two ($9.5M) because
    it was impractical due to the 11 year waitlist – and, accordingly, that the appellant’s
    position ($2M) was the only reasonable and appropriate one in the
    circumstances.  The appellant’s
    submission on appeal is, in effect, that the trial judge had a duty to put to
    the jury a position that he was not only required to devise on his own, but
    which was also not advanced or put to the jury by either party.  This argument is untenable, particularly in
    light of the above excerpts.  Further,
    although not determinative, the absence of any objection to the jury charge by
    counsel for the appellant at trial supports the conclusion that the charge was
    not erroneous in this regard.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>C.        Costs</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the issue of costs, the appellant has raised three
    grounds of appeal to support its submission that the trial judge’s costs award
    should be reduced. For the reasons that follow, we reject the appellant’s first
    two grounds of appeal, but accept the third. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>The trial judge gave the appellant credit

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the appellant argues that the trial judge should
    have reduced the total costs award by $159,000.  This sum represents a portion of the payment
    made by the defendants Gill and Purba Furniture Ltd. pursuant to a partial
    settlement of the claim, and which was ordered by Wilkins J. to be held in
    trust and applied against future fees: see <i>Marcoccia
    v. Gill</i>, 2007 CanLII 33 (ON S.C.), at para. 69.  In the appellant’s view, the failure to reduce
    the costs award by this amount constitutes a breach of the terms of the partial
    settlement, which provides that the appellant is not to be subject to any
    duplication in respect of costs and disbursements payable to the respondent
    pursuant to the partial settlement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We disagree.  The
    terms of the partial settlement provided for the payment of $1 million in
    damages, as well as an additional $395,000 payable to the respondent’s
    solicitors for fees and disbursements.  The
    full $395,000 was applied in payment of the respondent’s partial indemnity
    costs incurred to the date of the partial settlement.  The additional $159,000, designated by Wilkins
    J. to be held in trust and applied against future fees, was subtracted from the
    $1 million damages award recovered by the respondent.  In other words, the $159,000 was taken from
    the respondent’s damages award in the partial settlement and was directed to be
    held in trust so that the respondent’s solicitors would have access to funds to
    pay for the work necessary to bring the matter to trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In the costs endorsement released following the trial,
    the trial judge indicated that the appellant was required “to pay the net
    damages recovery less the $1,000,000 already recovered through the partial
    settlement of damages claims”: see <i>Marcoccia
    v. Gill</i>, 2007 CanLII 51528 (ON S.C.), at para. 10.  Therefore, contrary to the appellant’s
    assertion, the appellant was given credit for the $159,000.  These monies are included in the $1 million
    that the trial judge subtracted from the net damages award against the
    appellant, to account for the damages already recovered by the respondent in
    the partial settlement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the appellant seeks further reductions of
    $8,775 and $11,175 in the costs award.  With
    respect to the $11,175, the appellant submits that the trial judge’s costs
    award included $7,057.50 for an unsuccessful appeal by the respondent of a
    master’s order when, in fact, the appellant was awarded the costs of the appeal
    in the amount of $4,118.10.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the $8,775, the appellant argues that
    the trial judge awarded the respondent substantial indemnity costs of
    $21,937.50 for the guardianship motion.  He
    ought not to have done so as the offer to settle (on which the order of
    substantial indemnity costs is based) excluded the guardianship issue.  As a result, the costs related to this issue
    ought to have been awarded on a partial indemnity basis.  The difference between the two scales is
    $8,775.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent does not dispute that the costs awarded
    on the guardianship issue should have been on a partial indemnity basis, nor
    does he dispute that the appellant was awarded costs of the unsuccessful appeal
    of the master’s order.  Rather, the
    respondent argues that the trial judge made a global costs award in relation to
    the fees, consisting of $120,000 in partial indemnity costs and $600,000 in
    substantial indemnity costs.  There is no
    reason to believe that the award did not take into account the two points now
    being raised by the appellant.  Further,
    the last sentence in the trial judge’s reasons suggests that a portion of the
    costs award for work carried out after the date of the offer to settle was
    calculated on a partial indemnity scale.  This, the respondent submits, shows that the
    trial judge was conscious that the work relating to the guardianship motion,
    which took place after the offer to settle, did not attract substantial
    indemnity costs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We would not give effect to this ground of appeal.  In the portion of his reasons outlining the
    appellant’s submissions, the trial judge referred to both of these issues.  The fact that the trial judge did not again
    refer to them at the point in his reasons where he set the figure for the
    global costs award does not, in our view, indicate that the two points were not
    taken into account.  In fact, the partial
    indemnity component of the costs award was substantially less than the amount
    sought by the respondent, suggesting that the costs awarded to the appellant
    for the respondent’s unsuccessful appeal of the master’s order were taken into
    account by the trial judge.  Further, as
    noted by the respondent, the last sentence of the trial judge’s reasons
    provides some confirmation that he awarded the costs on the guardianship issue
    on a partial indemnity basis. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third, the appellant submits that the trial judge’s
    award of $600,000 in substantial indemnity costs amounts to an award of costs
    on a full indemnity basis.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From the reasons, it is not entirely clear how the
    trial judge came to the $600,000 figure.  It appears that, pursuant to the definition of
    “substantial indemnity costs” in rule 1.03 of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i><a
href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a>,
    the trial judge applied a multiplier of 1.5 to the sum of $400,000, being the
    amount of fees that he would have considered reasonable on a partial indemnity
    scale.  However, the $600,000 he awarded
    is more than the $559,489 in substantial indemnity costs sought by the
    respondent’s solicitors.  Although rule
    57.01(4)(d) of the <i>Rules of Civil
    Procedure</i> allows the court “to award costs in an amount that represents
    full indemnity”, there is nothing in the trial judge’s reasons to suggest that
    his $600,000 costs award was intended to be a full indemnity award.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is unclear from the record how the respondent calculated
    the sum of $559,489. However, it is reasonable to assume that the respondent’s
    solicitors applied a modest reduction to their regular hourly rates to achieve
    a substantial indemnity rate, which they then used as a basis for calculating
    their substantial indemnity costs in the amount of $559,489.  The substantial indemnity rates are set out in
    the contingency fee agreement made between the respondent and his solicitors. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent submits that the solicitors’ hourly
    rates were irrelevant because of the contingency fee agreement.  Although the agreement set out hourly rates,
    the fees actually charged to the respondent pursuant to the agreement were not
    hourly based.  In light of the favourable
    outcome for the respondent at trial, the fees charged were a percentage of his
    recovery and far exceeded the $600,000 costs award.  The respondent argues that the significant
    difference between the costs awarded against the appellant and the fees
    actually paid by the respondent to his solicitors is clear evidence that the
    respondent has not been fully indemnified. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The respondent further submits that, to the extent that
    hourly rates are a factor relevant in fixing the fees and/or costs, the trial
    judge noted that the substantial indemnity rates approved by him in the
    contingency fee agreement (which we have taken to be the rates that would
    ordinarily be recovered on a substantial indemnity basis) were “at a minimum,
    reasonable”: para. 65.  Thus, the respondent
    argues that these are the minimum rates recoverable by his solicitors. Should
    the trial judge have chosen not to apply one of the two percentage-of-recovery
    formulae set out in the contingency fee agreement, he could have based the fees
    on rates higher than these.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A further basis for the respondent’s suggestion that
    the $600,000 in substantial indemnity costs was warranted, even if it amounted
    to or exceeded full indemnity, is the trial judge’s view that the work being
    billed for was, in large measure, the work that required the greatest skill –
    work for trial preparation and the trial itself.  The costs award against the appellant was
    principally for trial and trial related work, because the costs incurred from
    the inception of the action to the period just preceding the trial had been
    assessed and paid as part of the partial settlement reached with the other
    defendants.  The respondent seems to
    suggest that for this reason, even though the award may have amounted to or exceeded
    full indemnity if the solicitors’ regular hourly rates were applied, it was
    fully justified. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In our view, the $600,000 substantial indemnity costs
    award cannot stand.  The trial judge
    properly concluded that, following <i>Walker
    v. Ritchie</i>, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 428, at para. 42, it was inappropriate to
    include in a costs award the risk premium being charged by the respondent’s
    solicitors.  By awarding the respondent
    more than what his solicitors had calculated to be the appropriate substantial
    indemnity amount, the trial judge was doing indirectly what he had concluded
    should not be done. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The $559,489 originally sought by the respondent
    represented a reasonable substantial indemnity award based on rates derived
    from the hourly rates normally charged by the solicitors who worked on the file.
     These rates generally reflect what the
    defendant reasonably expects to be the basis for the award of costs.  The fact that the contingency agreement
    provides for significantly higher fees in the event that the plaintiff is
    successful is of little relevance as the higher fee is, in effect, a form of
    risk premium. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, by suggesting that rates in excess of the
    solicitors’ regular hourly rates are justified for the hours devoted to the
    trial proper, the respondent is submitting that, in effect, the solicitors’
    regular hourly rates should be considered to be “blended rates”.  The rates would be viewed as a blend of higher
    rates for trial work and lower rates for work done in the pre-trial phases.  This overlooks the fact that the respondent’s
    costs for the pre-trial phases have already been assessed and recovered in the
    partial settlement using this “blended rate”. In fairness, therefore, if we
    were to disregard the “blended rate” and use a higher rate in the assessment of
    the work done at trial, the assessment of the pre-trial costs made as part of
    the partial settlement would have to be revisited.  These costs were based on the “blended rate”,
    being a rate that, on the respondent’s premise, exceeded the value of the work
    done.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Therefore, the substantial indemnity component of the
    costs award is excessive and ought to be reduced.  In so concluding, we do not wish to be taken
    as challenging the definition of substantial indemnity costs in rule 1.03 of
    the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>, or the
    trial judge’s decision to apply it.  However,
    we note that where the application of rule 1.03 leads to substantial indemnity
    costs that are equal to or greater than a full indemnity award, it necessarily
    follows that the partial indemnity costs have been assessed too generously.  Therefore, the effect of rule 1.03 is to limit
    the trial judge’s discretion in assessing partial indemnity costs to something
    less than two-thirds of the solicitor’s full indemnity costs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appropriate starting point for the substantial
    indemnity costs award should have been the $559,489 originally sought by the
    respondent.  As noted above, the
    respondent had included in this amount the $21,937.50 in costs flowing from the
    guardianship motion.  For reasons
    explained earlier, we have concluded that the trial judge included the costs
    for the guardianship motion within the $120,000 he awarded in partial indemnity
    costs.  The costs for the guardianship
    motion cannot be included in both the partial indemnity and substantial
    indemnity cost awards.  Therefore, the
    $559,489 claimed by the respondent in substantial indemnity costs must be
    reduced by $21,937.50 to reflect the fact that the costs of the guardianship
    motion are included in the trial judge’s partial indemnity component of the
    costs award.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In conclusion, we would allow the appeal on costs to
    the extent that the substantial indemnity costs should be reduced from $600,000
    to $537,551.50.  This reduces the fee
    portion of the costs award from $720,000 to $657,551.50.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>V.        <u>DISPOSITION</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the foregoing reasons, we would dismiss the appeal
    with respect to liability and damages.  We
    would allow the appeal on costs to the extent that the costs award should be
    reduced from $720,000 to $657,551.50.  The
    respondent is entitled to its costs of the appeal fixed at $25,000, inclusive
    of disbursements and GST.</p>
