  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>I.          BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Storms and Mr. Kaminskas are the owners of modest
    homes adjacent to each other in the City of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Niagara Falls.  Their homes are separated by a single paved
    driveway, which encroaches 3 feet onto the Storms’ property.  There is no room for a car to drive into the
    space between the houses.  Mr. Kaminskas
    uses the portion of the single-car driveway between the entrance steps to the
    houses and the front sidewalk to park his car.  In doing so, he says he is following a pattern that has been accepted by
    previous owners of these two homes for over 56 years.  The Storms – who purchased their property in
    2006, and whose daughter and son-in-law actually reside in the home – object.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The seeds for a potential dispute are readily apparent
    from a glance at the photo which is attached as Schedule A to these reasons.  There is no dispute that the driveway to Mr.
    Kaminskas’ home encroaches on the Storm’s titled property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To resolve the dispute, the Storms sought to build a
    fence down the middle of the driveway between the buildings and a three to four
    inch concrete curb on the dividing line of the open paved area.  This did not find favour with Mr. Kaminskas,
    who applied to the court for a declaration that he is entitled to a
    right-of-way over the driveway and for injunctive relief.  He succeeded.  Tucker J. found that he was entitled to a prescriptive easement over the
    disputed portion of the land and that he would be entitled to an injunction
    preventing the Storms from interfering with his use of the property.  The Storms appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Consent or permission operates to defeat a claim to a
    prescriptive right.  While Mr. Kaminskas
    and his predecessors in title had exclusive and continuing use of the driveway
    for parking purposes for over half a century, the evidence is clear that they
    used the driveway in that fashion with the permission (oral or written) of the
    prior owners of the Storm property.  Respectfully, the application judge erred in failing to calculate the
    period of unpermitted user as the period “next before” the commencement of the application.  Moreover, her attempts to characterize the
    permission granted as ineffective, or to differentiate it as something else,
    are not supportable on the evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would allow the appeal.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>II.        FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Kaminskas purchased the property at
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    5087 Kitchener St.
    in October, 1991, from a Mr. Parisi.  Mr.
    Parisi, in turn, had purchased the property in 1980 from his grandfather, who
    had owned it since 1970.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Storms acquired the adjacent property at
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    5091 Kitchener St.
    in March 2006 from Ross and Harriet Angiers, who had owned it since 1950. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Kaminskas claims, himself, to have had exclusive
    and continuous use of the disputed driveway – which encroaches approximately 3
    feet onto the Storm’s side – for 16 years prior to the application.  His predecessors in title enjoyed a similar
    use as far back as 1950.  The existence
    of the right to the use is important to him because the City by-law prohibits
    parking on the street at that point and there is no other parking available on
    his property.  The Storm property, on the
    other hand, has its own driveway on the opposite side of the building.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The evidence is that Mr. Parisi used the driveway in
    the same fashion during his tenure.  Mr.
    Parisi stated in his affidavit that his grandfather also used the driveway, to
    his knowledge and belief, although his grandfather, himself, did not drive.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Angiers swore he and his wife “were always aware of
    the previous and current owners of
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    5087
    Kitchener Street, using the single car driveway
    that encroached onto [their lands].”  In
    fact, he said that to the best of his knowledge and recollection the driveway “was
    already on the property” when he and Mrs. Angiers bought it in 1950, and “had
    been in use of the then owners” at that time.  He and Mr. Parisi Sr. (the grandfather) paved the driveway
    together.  Mr. Angiers swore that he made
    the person he thought was the buyer of their property – Mr. Balice, the
    son-in-law who now occupies it with the Storm’s daughter – aware of the
    encroachment and that they “shook hands agreeing to this encroachment and
    condition.”  He said that Mr. Kaminskas
    “has had the exclusive use” of the driveway and that he and Mrs. Angiers “had
    always given permission to the previous and present owners of
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    5087 Kitchener Street
    … to the use of this single car driveway and the said encroachment.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the encroachment is visually obvious, no
    declarations of possession were ever tendered on either the Kaminskas purchase
    in 1991 or the Storm purchase in 2006.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 1991, when Mr. Kaminskas acquired
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    5087 Kitchener St. from Mr. Parisi, the
    Angiers provided Mr. Kaminskas with a letter consenting to his use of the
    disputed driveway.  This letter said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>To: Janice Parker<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a> &amp; John Kaminskas:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>We, Ross &amp;
    Harriet Angiers give our consent to Janice and John for full use of the mutual
    driveway at 5087 and
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    5091
    Kitchener Street.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            Sincerely,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>                                    [Signed]
    Ross S. Angiers</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Storms’ side of the story was put forward partly through
    the affidavit of Mr. Balice.  He says the
    problems began when Mr. Kaminskas started to park on the encroachment part of
    the driveway, rather than on his own side.<a
href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a>  From the perspective of Mr. Balice and the
    Storms’ daughter, if Mr. Kaminskas were to park on “his” side, they would allow
    him to use the disputed portion of the driveway to get in and out of his car on
    the driver’s side.  They wish to use the
    driveway to put out their garbage and to have access to their back yard.  When Mr. Kaminskas parks in the centre of the
    driveway, they are unable to do so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Balice says that he did not know of the letter from
    Mr. Angiers to Mr. Kaminskas, cited above.  As the application judge noted, however, neither he nor Mr. Storm specifically
    deny the conversation with Mr. Angiers concerning the use of the driveway and
    shaking hands on it.  Nor do they
    specifically deny knowing about the claimed easement, either from the surveys
    or from the visual appearance and use of the property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application was heard and determined on the basis of
    the affidavit evidence filed.  No one was
    cross-examined.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>III.       THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants make two principal submissions.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They argue, first, that the application judge erred in
    the manner in which she calculated the time required for a prescriptive
    easement claim pursuant to the<i> Real
    Property Limitations Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.15, ss. 31 and 32.  The application judge determined that Mr.
    Kaminskas had established an absolute 40-year right that crystallized before
    the 1991 letter was provided and, therefore, that the letter of permission could
    not defeat what was already an absolute prescriptive easement.  The appellants submit, however, that the relevant
    time period for a prescriptive easement under the Act is “the period next
    before some action wherein the claim … was or is brought into question”, i.e.
    from the date of the commencement of the application in these proceedings.  The 1991 letter of permission therefore
    operates to defeat the prescriptive right, they say.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Secondly, the appellants submit there were insufficient
    facts before the court to enable the application judge to find a prescriptive
    easement and Mr. Kaminskas failed to meet his burden of proof in that respect.<u></u></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with the appellants’ submission that Mr.
    Kaminskas’ claim under statute is defeated by the written consent provided to
    him by the Angiers in 1991.  Further, the
    evidence failed to establish that the user was “as of right”.     </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>IV.       LAW &amp; ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h3 style='page-break-after:avoid'>The Applicable Principles</h3>
  <p style='page-break-after:avoid'><u>Methods of Acquisition of
    Easements by Prescription</u></p>
  <h3>&nbsp;</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In law, there are three ways in which an easement may
    be acquired by prescription:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>prescription at common law;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>prescription by the doctrine of lost modern grant; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>prescription by statute (<i>Real Property Limitations Act</i>).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Prescription at common law is no longer relevant.  It requires use of the disputed right since
    “time immemorial.”  Time immemorial, for
    purposes of the period of legal memory is defined as the year 1189, the
    beginning of the reign of King Richard I.  Obviously, a prescriptive right at common law is somewhat difficult to
    prove in modern times, particularly in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  It has been said that prescription by common
    law cannot exist here because there is no legal memory on which to found it:
    see A.H. Oosterhoff &amp; W.B. Rayner, 2d ed. <i>Anger and Honsberger: Law of Real Property</i>, vol. 2<i> </i>(Aurora, Ont.: Canada Law Book Inc.,
    1985), at p. 936, citing <i>Abell v. Village
    of Woodbridge and County of York</i> (1917), 39 O.L.R. 382 (H.C.), rev’d on
    other grounds 45 O.L.R. 79 (S.C. App. Div.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The doctrine of lost modern grant, on the other hand,
    “is alive” and – as Cory J.A. noted, drily, in <i>Henderson v. Volk</i> (1982), 35 O.R. (2d) 379 (C.A.), at p. 382<b> </b>– “if not well is at least surviving
    in the province of Ontario.”  This
    doctrine was developed in common law jurisprudence to overcome the
    inconvenience of the common law rule (where the right could be defeated if it
    could be proven that the right claimed did not exist at any point in time
    within legal memory).  Under the doctrine
    of lost modern grant, the courts will presume that there must have been a grant
    made sometime, but that the grant had been lost.  Uninterrupted user as of right at any point
    in time will create the prescriptive right under this doctrine, provided it was
    for at least 20 years.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Cory J.A. described the doctrine of lost modern grant
    in <i>Henderson v. Volk</i>, at pp. 382-383:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The doctrine indicates that
    where there has been upwards of 20 years uninterrupted enjoyment of an easement
    and such enjoyment has all the necessary qualities to fulfil the requirements
    of prescription, then apart from some aspects such as incapacity that might
    vitiate its operation but which do not concern us here, the law will adopt the
    legal fiction that such a grant was made despite the absence of any direct
    evidence that it was in fact made.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It should be emphasized that the nature of the
    enjoyment necessary to establish an easement under the doctrine of lost modern
    grant is exactly the same as that required to establish an easement by
    prescription under the <i>Limitations Act</i>.  Thus, the claimant must demonstrate a use and
    enjoyment of the right-of-way under a claim of right which was continuous,
    uninterrupted, open and peaceful for a period of 20 years.  However, in the case of the doctrine of lost
    modern grant, it does not have to be the 20-year period immediately preceding
    the bringing of an action.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>As well, the enjoyment must not be permissive.  That is to say, it cannot be a user of the
    right-of-way enjoyed from time to time at the will and pleasure of the owner of
    the property over which the easement is sought to be established. [Citations

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>d)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>a right must be capable of forming the subject matter
    of a grant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, for an easement to be created by
    prescription, the user of the alleged right (for the applicable time period)
    must be shown to have been (i) continuous, and (ii) “as of right”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here, there is no real issue that the proclaimed
    easement meets the four essential criteria of an easement at common law, or
    that the use of the driveway by Mr. Kaminskas and his predecessors was
    continuous.  The appeal hinges on whether
    the user was “as of right”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>User “as of right” means that the use has been
    uninterrupted, open, peaceful and without permission for the relevant period of
    time.  It is often described using the
    Latin maxim <i>nec vi, nec clam, nec
    precario</i> (i.e., without force, without secrecy, and without “precario”).  “Precario” in this sense is taken to mean “[t]hat
    which depends not on right, but on the will of another person”: <i>Burrows v. Lang</i>, [1901] 2

    Sweet &amp; Maxwell Ltd., 2002), at para. 4-82.  <i>Nec precario</i>, therefore, means
    “without permission.” </p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>Differences between Prescriptive
    Easements under Statute and Lost Modern Grant</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There are three important differences between a
    prescriptive easement arising by statute and a prescriptive easement arising by
    lost modern grant, however.  First, in
    order to establish a prescriptive right by statute, it is necessary for the
    user to have been continuous, uninterrupted, open, peaceful and without
    permission for a period of 20 or 40 years immediately preceding the
    commencement of the action or assertion of the claim – in the language of s.
    32, during the 20 or 40-year “period <i>next
    before</i> some action wherein the claim … to which such period relates was or
    is brought into question” (emphasis added).  For the right to accrue under the doctrine of lost modern grant,
    however, the requisite user need not be for the period “next before” the action,
    but may exist during any uninterrupted 20-year period or longer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While the “next before” requirement may give rise to
    unfairness in some circumstances, there are policy reasons founded in the need
    to promote certainty and stability in conveyancing law that support its
    existence.  As the authors of a leading
    text, Robert Megarry &amp; William Wade, <i>The
    Law of Real Property</i>, 6th ed. by Charles Harpum (London: Sweet &amp;
    Maxwell Ltd., 2000), observe, at p. 1138, footnote 76:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It should be noted
    that, for all its shortcomings, prescription under the <i>Prescription Act 1832</i> is, from a conveyancing point of view,
    preferable to prescription by lost modern grant.  Because it has to be exercised without
    interruption “next before some suit or action”, it may be easier for any
    purchaser of the servient tenement to discover.  If an easement has been acquired by lost modern grant … [a] purchaser
    may be bound by it even though he could not have discovered its existence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addition, the “next before” requirement under the
    legislation confines the courts review to a relatively recent period of time,
    when the evidence will be easier to obtain and evaluate, and therefore may be
    preferable to the lost modern grant regime for that reason: see U.K., “Easements,
    Covenants and Profits à Prendre”, The Law Commission Consultation Paper No.
    186, (2008), at p. 80, para. 4.213. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Secondly, a statutory claim to a prescriptive easement
    based on 40-years’ user can be defeated by permission only where that
    permission was given in writing.  This is
    established by the closing words of s. 31, which, for convenience, I repeat:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[W]here the way …
    has been so enjoyed for the full period of forty years, the right thereto shall
    be deemed absolute and indefeasible, unless it appears that it was enjoyed by
    some consent or agreement expressly given or made for that purpose by deed or
    writing. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under the statute, a 40-year right will not be
    considered permissive (“<i>precario</i>”)
    unless it is enjoyed by written permission.  However, claims to a prescriptive right based on the doctrine of lost
    modern grant (or with respect to the statutory right based on 20 years’ user)
    can be defeated by consent or permission, whether written or oral.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, it is noteworthy that the 40-year concept is a
    creature of the statutory prescriptive right.  It has no application to the doctrine of lost modern grant, which
    requires only an appropriate user of 20 years or more without permission.</p>
  <h3 style='page-break-after:avoid'>Application of the Principles to this Case</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In light of the foregoing review of the principles
    underlying prescriptive easements, it is apparent where the dilemma for Mr.
    Kaminskas arises.  His claim under statute
    is defeated by the written consent provided to him by the Angiers in 1991, less
    than twenty years “next before” the commencement of his application.  It is also defeated by the permission – by
    inference, an oral permission – that Mr. Angiers says he and his wife “had
    always given” to the owners of the Kaminskas property, whether the claim is
    based on statute or on the doctrine of lost modern grant.</p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>The Application Judge’s Reasons</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The application judge rejected the argument “that
    ‘consent’ or ‘permission’ somehow operated to remove what [she found] to be an
    easement since at least 1950 and, accordingly, [was] now a prescriptive
    easement.”  She went on to say (at para.
    25):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In any event, from 1950 until 2006, Mr. Angiers
    makes it clear that the neighbours have used as a right the driveway that
    encroaches on his lands.  I agree that
    the words used in 1991 were “permission” and “mutual driveway”, however, as
    indicated, Mr. Angiers would not be in a position in 1991 to grant permission
    to anyone having acknowledged and accepted the use of the property by the
    predecessors in title and the fact that the use pre-dated his occupation of his
    property.  In this regard, I quote from
    the case of <i>Rose v. Krieser</i> (2002),
    58 O.R. (3d) 641 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    )
    in which the Court of Appeal considers s. 31:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Examined in context, it
    is apparent that the closing words of s. 31 relating to the 40 year time period
    are to be read in contrast with the preceding part of the section dealing with
    the 20 year time period.  The words “consent
    or agreement expressly given or made for that purpose by deed or writing” in
    relation to the 40 year time period relate to the common law defence of <i>permission</i> given by deed or writing, and
    clarify that the defence of <i>permission</i> does not apply in full measure to the 40 year period.  Rather, the defence is limited to <i>written</i> <i>permission </i>with respect to the 40 year period. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Moreover, it is clear,
    in my view, that the words “consent or agreement expressly given or made for
    that purpose by deed or writing” cannot apply to <i>a</i> <i>use as of right</i> given
    by deed or writing.  The very foundation
    of the law of prescription is the presumption that the use originated with a
    grant of <i>the right</i> claimed.  Proof of a written agreement granting the
    right simply displaces prescription; it does not constitute a defence of the
    claim.  On the other hand, <i>permission</i> negatives a claimant’s
    assertion that his use was “as of right” and constitutes a real defence to the
    claim.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Here, I find that the use was a right.  The rights accrued 40 years prior to the 1991
    letter without “permission.”  I find it
    was not a mere acquiescence; it was acceptance and the use of the term
    permission does not erase that right. [Emphasis in original.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These findings appear to have been based on a
    prescriptive easement by statute – the application judge earlier cites the
    relevant law as being centred in ss. 31 and 32 of the <i>Real Property Limitations Act</i>, and makes no reference to the
    doctrine of lost modern grant – and to have been founded on the notion that prescriptive
    title had been acquired <i>before</i> the
    letter of 1991 was provided.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This may be a fair result, if the application judge were exercising a discretionary or equitable jurisdiction in making her decision.  Respectfully, the foregoing passage from her reasons discloses a number of misconceptions of the evidence and of the law.  I do not see how her conclusion can be born out on the record, given the law described above and the uncontested evidence of Mr. Angiers.</p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>Error in how Time was Calculated under
    the Act</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Insofar as the application judge purported to find a
    prescriptive easement by statute, she failed to apply the “next before” time
    parameters of s. 32.  I agree with the
    appellants’ submissions in this regard.  Even if Mr. Angier’s evidence is explained away as acceptance, rather
    than permission, throughout the period between 1950 and 1991, the 1991 letter
    granting Mr. Kaminskas <i>consent</i> to use
    the driveway for parking broke any prior period of open and uninterrupted use
    without permission.  And it did so within
    the 20 year period immediately preceding the commencement of the application,
    which is sufficient to prevent the right from crystallizing under the Act.</p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>The User was Not “As of Right” </span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Angiers evidence does not make it clear, however, –
    or, indeed, even suggest – that his neighbours had used the driveway “as a
    right”.  His evidence is that they used
    it at all times with his and his wife’s permission.  Mr. Angiers – who would know – was not
    cross-examined on his affidavit.  He did not
    say he and his wife “acquiesced” in their neighbours’ use of the driveway (a
    state of affairs that would justify the finding of a prescriptive easement,
    other factors being equal).  His evidence
    was unequivocal: “My wife, Harriet Angiers and I had always given <i>permission</i> to the previous and present
    owners of 5087 Kitchener Street … to the use of this single car driveway and
    the said encroachment” (emphasis added).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, the application judge’s comment that Mr.
    Angiers “would not be in a position in 1991 to grant permission to anyone
    having acknowledged and accepted the use of the property by the predecessors in
    title and the fact that the use pre-dated his occupation of his property” is
    based on the same misconception of the evidence.  Mr. Angiers did not say he “acknowledged and
    accepted the use of the property”.  He
    said they gave permission for the use.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The legal premise that the prescriptive right had
    already crystallized before the 1991 letter of consent was provided is also
    mistaken.  The application judge focused
    on the point that permission can only defeat the 40 year period if it is
    evidenced in writing.  This is apparent
    from her quotation from <i>Rose v. Krieser</i> and from her own statement that “[t]he rights accrued 40 years prior to the
    1991 letter without ‘permission’.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Her reasoning appears to have pursued the following
    logic.  Mr. Kaminskas and his
    predecessors in title had used the driveway since at least 1950, and perhaps
    before that time. There was at least 40 years user before 1991 and the rights
    had “accrued” by that time.  Mr. Angiers
    was therefore not in a position to give “permission” by the date of the letter
    and the letter was, in effect, meaningless.  Oral consent is not capable of defeating a 40 year prescriptive right.  The use before 1991 was therefore without
    permission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This logic does not get Mr. Kaminskas to where he needs
    to be, however.  The 40 years’ user was
    founded upon the Angiers’ permission.</p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>Doctrine of Lost Modern Grant </span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the doctrine of lost modern grant – not
    alluded to by the application judge, but raised on appeal – does not assist Mr.
    Kaminskas either.  Although permission
    can defeat a 40 year period of user for purposes of a prescriptive easement by
    statute only if evidenced in writing, oral permission is sufficient to defeat a
    prescriptive easement by lost modern grant.  Here, the evidence is that the Angiers at all times gave permission to
    the use of the driveway for parking.  It
    is not said whether that permission was oral or written, but since the 1991
    letter is the only reference on the record to consent in writing, it is a
    reasonable inference that, prior to the letter, the ongoing permission was
    oral.  In any event, a prescriptive right
    by lost modern grant cannot be established if the user was by permission,
    whether written or oral – it can only arise where the user is “as of right”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This result may seem unfair to Mr. Kaminskas.  It is apparent that he and his predecessors
    in title have had the continuous, open, uninterrupted, peaceful and exclusive
    use of the driveway for purposes of parking over a period of at least 56 years
    before the commencement of these proceedings.  Everyone was in agreement, except for the current occupants and owners
    of the Storm property.  But it is also
    apparent that this user was with the permission of the predecessors in title to
    the Storms.  And permission defeats a
    prescriptive easement.</p>

    has long been disparaged on that basis.  For example, in 1966, the U.K. Law Reform Commission stated that the

    Reform Committee, 14th Report, Cmnd 3100 (1966), at para. 40).  Simmons J.A. echoed this comment in <i>Rose v. Krieser</i>, at para. 22.  In spite of these criticisms, however, the
    language of the
