  <h3>I. Overview</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The appellants, Morrison Fuels, 503373 Ontario Limited,
    and John McDougall appeal from the judgment dated February 20, 2008 dismissing
    their third party claim against the respondents, D.W. Stanzel Plumbing and
    Heating Limited and Donald Wright Stanzel, for contributory negligence and
    apportionment of damages.  The
    appellants’ third party claim related to the apportionment of liability for
    significant residential property damage and environmental remediation costs
    stemming from an inadvertent oil discharge that resulted from an oil delivery
    they mistakenly made to the residence of the plaintiffs in the main action,
    Mary Patricia and Francis Bingley.  </p>
  <h3><span lang=EN-US>II. Facts</span></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In 1979, the Bingleys hired Stanzel Plumbing to decommission
    their old oil heating furnace and to convert their heating system to natural
    gas.  In so doing, Stanzel Plumbing removed
    the Bingleys’ oil furnace but left in place the oil tank in the basement as
    well as the oil fill pipe and the vent pipe located on the exterior of the
    house.  Stanzel Plumbing tightened the
    cap on the oil fill pipe so that it could not be removed by hand and then
    turned this pipe down towards the ground to prevent it from being filled in
    this position and to indicate that it was no longer to be used.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Twenty-two years later, on March 8, 2001,
    McDougall, an employee of Morrison Fuels, misread a delivery ticket and mistakenly
    made an oil delivery to the Bingleys’ home in Smiths Falls, Ontario.  He found the Bingleys’ oil fill pipe on the
    exterior of the house in a downward position with its cap end pointing towards
    the ground at approximately a 45 degree angle.  Erroneously thinking that the oil fill pipe was simply loose, he raised
    it to a 45 degree angle pointing the opposite way from the position it was in when
    he first saw it and then loosened the cap with a wrench.  He then began pumping oil and heard the usual
    whistle sound from the vent pipe, which indicated that oil was going into the
    tank and air was coming out of it.  He
    did not realize his error until he had mistakenly pumped 933.4 liters of
    furnace oil into the wrong residence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Unfortunately, the Bingleys’ old decommissioned oil
    tank had rusted and leaked.  As a result,
    oil spilled onto the unfinished basement surface and entered the soil and
    groundwater.  The house was rendered
    uninhabitable and serious environmental contamination occurred.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The Bingleys brought an action for negligence
    against the appellants.  The appellants
    admitted their negligence, settled the Bingleys’ claim, and remediated the
    Bingleys’ property at a total cost of over $1 million.  The appellants brought a third party claim
    against the respondents, claiming contributory negligence and apportionment of
    damages based on allegations that the respondents had negligently
    decommissioned the Bingleys’ oil heating system in 1979.  The trial judge found that the respondents
    had not been negligent and, accordingly, dismissed the appellants’ third party claim<span
style='font-size:14.0pt'>.  </span>The
    appellants appeal to this court.<span style='font-size:14.0pt'> </span></p>
  <h3>III. The Reasons of the Trial Judge</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge began by itemizing the many elements of
    the appellants’ carelessness.  The oil delivery
    person, McDougall, had been employed by Morrison Fuels for only two months.  
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Smiths
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Falls was his hometown.  Although he had seen similar down-turned
    exterior oil fill pipes in the town before, he did not know nor had he been
    trained as to their significance.  On the
    day of the incident, he was working in a hurry and mistakenly misread the
    delivery ticket.  The delivery ticket
    contained information in addition to the address that would have indicated to
    McDougall, had he taken the time to read it properly, that the Bingleys’ home
    was not the right address.  The ticket also
    indicated that the exterior vent and oil fill pipes were located at a different
    corner of the house than where he found them at the Bingleys’ house.  Further, the ticket indicated that there was
    no whistle in the vent pipe to indicate that the oil tank had air.  The absence of a whistle was unusual and,
    presumably, warranted extra care to avoid overfilling the intended customer’s
    oil tank.  Finally, the ticket indicated
    that the delivery volume was expected to be approximately 560 liters, significantly
    less than the 933.4 liters McDougall pumped into the Bingleys’ decommissioned
    oil tank.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The appellants’ negligence was not an issue at
    trial; they had already admitted their negligence and had settled with the
    Bingleys.  Nor was there an issue that
    the respondents owed a duty of care to the Bingleys when they performed the conversion
    work.  The trial judge observed that the only
    issue was the measurement of the standard of care expected of Stanzel Plumbing
    in 1979 for the decommissioning and whether Stanzel Plumbing met that standard.  If it did not, it was negligent and contributed
    to the damages caused by Morrison Fuels’ mistaken furnace oil delivery. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In determining the standard of care, the trial
    judge considered the following factors:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>For Stanzel Plumbing, the question,
    then, to be asked is what would have been the standard of care expected of an
    ordinary, reasonable and prudent person in the same circumstances, having
    regard to the likelihood of a known or reasonably foreseeable harm, the gravity
    of that harm, the burden or cost which would be incurred to prevent the harm, industry
    practice and regulatory standards.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge found that Stanzel Plumbing’s method of
    decommissioning the Bingleys’ oil furnace was an accepted industry practice in
    1979 and that it complied with the then applicable regulatory standard.  In 1979, the governing regulatory requirement
    was section 3.3.3 of th<i>e Canadian Gas
    Association Installation Code for Natural Gas Burning Appliances and Equipment,
    CGA B149.1-1976</i> (the 1976<i> Code</i>):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3.3.3 When the installation of an
    appliance constitutes a conversion from another form of energy including oil,
    gas, propane and electricity it shall be the responsibility of the installer to
    ensure that the means of supply of the other form of energy <i>has either been removed or left safe and
    secure from accidental discharge</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge also noted that the 1976 <i>Code</i> was amended in 1982 in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario to require
    removal or plugging of the oil fill pipe when converting an oil heating system to
    natural gas.  Stanzel, the owner of
    Stanzel Plumbing, testified that prior to the 1982 amendment, if his customers chose
    the least costly method of conversion, his practice was to leave the vent pipe
    in its upright position because it could never be filled with oil, but to
    tighten the cap of the fill pipe so that it could not be turned by hand and to
    turn the fill pipe towards the ground, usually at a 90 degree angle, as an
    indication to oil delivery persons that “they should be asking questions before
    putting oil in through that pipe.”  Stanzel
    expressed the opinion that this method complied with the requirement in the
    1976 <i>Code </i>to leave a decommissioned heating
    system “safe and secure from accidental discharge.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>John Butler, who also decommissioned oil heating systems
    as part of his business, was called as an expert witness by the respondents.  He testified that prior to the 1982 amendment
    to the 1976 <i>Code</i>, one of the industry
    practices in decommissioning an oil heating system, if the old oil tank and
    piping were not to be removed, was to turn the oil fill pipe down to the ground
    as a signal to any fuel delivery person.  He also expressed the opinion that this practice satisfied the
    requirement in the 1976 <i>Code </i>of
    leaving the decommissioned oil system “safe and secure from accidental
    discharge.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the basis of this evidence, the trial judge found that
    the method used by Stanzel Plumbing to perform the Bingleys’ conversion work
    was an accepted industry practice in 1979.  She also found that it complied with the 1976 <i>Code</i>, although she noted that the better conversion method would
    have been to remove or plug the fill pipe.  She recognized, however, that these findings
    were not determinative and that it was still necessary to consider whether the
    respondents had met “the standard of care that would be expected of an
    ordinary, reasonable and prudent person in the circumstances, including the
    reasonable foreseeability of the harm.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I set out below the trial judge’s analysis of this
    issue completely:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[33]    …In 1979, industry practice that was <i>Code</i> compliant allowed for tightly
    capped and turned down oil fill pipes as part of a decommissioning method.  The homeowners were able to choose this method
    and did.  Stanzel Plumbing heard of no
    problem associated with this method. In 2001 a fuel oil delivery was made by a
    man who, having been trained in the safe handling of “dangerous goods” ignored
    the most basic safety rule from his training that the fuel was to be delivered
    to the right address.  He never checked
    to see if he had the right address.  He
    had not been trained as to the significance of down-turned oil fill pipes
    within his delivery area.  Nothing about
    the state of the residence that he should have noticed had he read the delivery
    ticket or known of the significance of those down-turned oil fill pipes, served
    to give him any warning that not only was he at the wrong place, but that place
    had no fuel oil heating system.  He did
    not ask any questions of his office when he noticed the down-turned pipe and
    its very tight cap, even though that option was easily available to him through
    the use of his two-way phone.  He did not
    seem to understand that moving an oil fill pipe as much as he did, even if this
    had been at a home that used furnace oil, could cause leaks in the piping
    system.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[34]    The duty of care and the proper performance
    of its content was an obligation that Stanzel Plumbing owed to the homeowners
    in 1979.  It was not a duty of care that
    extended to Morrison Fuels or to any other furnace oil delivery company, to
    save them from making an egregious mistake in the face of all indications to
    the contrary and delivering furnace oil to a place with no oil furnace.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based on this analysis, the trial judge concluded as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[35]    In terms of the objective and reasonable
    foreseeability of this kind of harm, I cannot find that an ordinary, reasonable
    and prudent tradesperson in 1979 who is aware of and who complies with the <i>Code</i> and whose choice of measures is
    concurred in by the homeowners would reasonably foresee this kind and degree of
    mistake and negligence by someone who had nothing to do with the homeowners.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[36]    In other words, I find that in exercising
    its standard of care owed to the homeowners, Stanzel Plumbing could not have
    reasonably foreseen that a delivery of fuel oil that was not authorized by
    anyone and that was made in the face of many indicators to the contrary would
    be made into that tightened and down-turned oil fill pipe.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having reached these conclusions, the trial judge
    dismissed the appellants’ third party claim against the respondents.  She went on to state, however, that in the
    event she was wrong and the respondents’ failure to remove or permanently plug
    the oil fill pipe as part of their conversion work for the Bingleys did create a
    reasonably foreseeable risk that there could be a mistaken delivery of furnace
    oil into the oil fill pipe, she would have apportioned the liability between
    the parties as follows: the respondents’ fault at 5%; Morrison Fuels’ fault at
    20%; and, McDougall’s fault at 75%. </p>
  <h3>IV. Analysis</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge properly stated the governing legal
    principles of negligence.  I would not
    interfere with her application of those principles to the relevant regulatory
    requirements, industry practice, gravity of harm, and burden or cost to prevent
    that harm.  However, in my view, she
    erred in applying the reasonable foreseeability of harm factor to the
    circumstances of this case.  Before
    explaining why her analysis of the foreseeability factor was flawed, I briefly
    comment on the trial judge’s treatment of the other factors. </p>
  <h5>          <span style='font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>A. The Other Factors</span></h5>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, I am skeptical of the trial judge’s finding that
    the method used by Stanzel Plumbing in performing the Bingley’s conversion work
    in 1979 met the requirement in the 1976 <i>Code</i> that the decommissioned heating system be left “safe and secure from accidental
    discharge.”  I would have thought that a
    tightened cap and a downturned fill pipe, left accessible where they could be
    undone easily by anyone, have not been left in a “secure” state.  However, I recognize that the trial judge’s
    finding was open to her on the record before her.  I note, though, that the record did not
    include evidence from the governing regulatory body, but only opinions from
    tradespersons in the business of decommissioning furnaces.  The finding that Stanzel Plumbing did not
    infringe the applicable regulatory standard, as the trial judge noted, is not,
    by itself, determinative of the standard of care. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the trial judge’s finding that the method used
    by Stanzel Plumbing was an industry practice in 1979 was also open to her on
    the record before her.  I am not
    convinced, as the appellant argued, that the trial judge relied on evidence she
    had ruled inadmissible in making this finding. I would make the comment,
    however, that the record did not enable the trial judge to make a broader assessment
    of industry practice than what one or two tradespersons did in a fairly small
    geographic area.  While this factor, too,
    weighs in favour of finding that the respondents met the standard of care, it is
    also not determinative.  Moreover, the
    poor quality of the evidence regarding industry practice reduces the weight to
    be given to this factor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The other two factors, the gravity of harm and the
    burden or costs of preventing the harm, were not disputed at trial.  The potential harm was exceedingly grave, as the
    damages suffered in this case illustrate.  The cost of prevention, as the trial judge noted, was minimal; simply plugging
    the fuel oil fill pipe would have certainly and permanently prevented the possibility
    of an accidental discharge. </p>
  <h5>          <span style='font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>B. Reasonable Foreseeability of Harm Analysis</span></h5>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I turn, then, to the trial judge’s analysis of the
    reasonable foreseeability of harm in the circumstances of this case.  The trial judge considered whether a mistaken
    delivery occasioned by the particular chain of events that unfolded in this
    case was reasonably foreseeable rather than considering whether, in general, harm
    from a mistaken delivery of oil to the Bingley residence was reasonably foreseeable.  The trial judge erred in approaching the
    reasonable foreseeability analysis in this fashion.</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is enough to fix liability if one could foresee

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly, Dickson J.A. emphasized that “one need not
    envisage ‘the precise concatenation of circumstances which led up to the
    accident’”, provided that the general harm is reasonably foreseeable:

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this case, there is no doubt that the respondents’
    witnesses, Stanzel and
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Butler,
    subjectively foresaw the risk that an oil delivery person could make a mistake by
    inadvertently delivering fuel to the Bingley address.  Indeed, they explained that the very purpose
    of turning the fill pipe downward was to signal to any delivery person who
    arrived at the Bingley residence that the oil heating system had been
    decommissioned.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge, however, did not consider whether, in
    general, such a mistaken delivery was reasonably foreseeable.  Rather, she referred to the specific chain of
    events for which the appellants admitted negligence and concluded that “this
    kind and degree of mistake and negligence by someone who had nothing to do with
    the homeowners” was not reasonably foreseeable by the respondents.  She also stated that it was not reasonably foreseeable
    that a delivery of fuel oil “that was not authorized by anyone and that was made
    in the face of many indicators to the contrary would be made into [the]
    tightened and down-turned oil fill pipe.”  In approaching the analysis in this fashion, the trial judge incorrectly
    considered whether the harm could reasonably have been foreseen to occur in the
    particular way that it did.  This
    approach is contrary to the proper reasonable foreseeability analysis
    articulated in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Assiniboine</i>,
    which requires only that the general harm, not “its manner of incidence”, be
    reasonably foreseeable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even focusing on the manner of incidence of the harm in
    this case, I do not agree with the trial judge’s conclusion that it was not
    reasonably foreseeable that a mistaken delivery would occur “in the face of
    many indicators to the contrary”.  In
    addition to the downturned fill pipe and the tightened cap, these additional indicators
    were items of information set out on the delivery ticket.  In my mind, however, these indicators do not
    support the trial judge’s conclusion.  To
    the contrary, it may be safely assumed that any oil delivery person who attends
    at the wrong address has not read the delivery ticket carefully.  The method used by Stanzel Plumbing is
    implicitly premised on an oil delivery person not reading the delivery ticket
    carefully and, as a result, attending at the wrong address.  Accordingly, I fail to see how listing the
    various additional items of information on the delivery ticket that McDougall failed
    to read decreased the reasonable foreseeability of a mistaken delivery.  What is important is what all the witnesses
    contemplated – that an oil delivery person could arrive at the wrong address to
    deliver oil.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The correct approach leads to the conclusion that the respondents’
    failure to take the measure of permanently plugging the oil fill pipe created a
    reasonably foreseeable risk that oil could be mistakenly pumped into the pipe
    at some later time.  Fill pipes are located
    on the exterior of houses and are accessible to anyone and subject to
    interference of one kind or another.  The
    Bingleys’ fill pipe was on the side of the house next to an extremely narrow
    driveway and was intended to be left in place indefinitely, irrespective of who
    owned and occupied the house.  It could easily
    be unintentionally bumped by a vehicle, perhaps a moving truck, or tampered
    with by anyone unfamiliar with the warning signal intended by the respondents.  There was a reasonably foreseeable risk that,
    over the years, the pipe could be moved to a more upright position by some event
    or interference, thus negating the intended warning signal, and that a mistaken
    delivery could occur as a result.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore, while the respondents took the additional measure
    of tightening the fill pipe cap, this must be considered in light of the
    evidence presented at trial that it was not uncommon for a delivery person to
    have difficulty removing the cap due to the type of threading or temperature-related
    issues.  In addition, the respondents
    left the whistle in place, the presence of which would generally indicate to an
    oil deliverer that the oil was being pumped properly into an intact oil tank.  Finally, it was reasonably foreseeable that,
    with the passage of time, an empty oil tank could rust and lose its capacity to
    hold oil securely. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In short, the possibility of a mistaken delivery was both
    subjectively foreseen by the respondents and, more importantly, was objectively
    foreseeable.  The method used by Stanzel
    Plumbing did not adequately safeguard against this reasonably foreseeable harm.  Combining reasonable foreseeability with the
    enormous potential harm and the trifling cost of permanently plugging the fill
    pipe, I conclude that the respondents breached the standard of care owed to the
    Bingleys. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two comments are worth making about the conclusion that
    the respondents breached the standard of care owed to the Bingleys. First, though
    I agree it would be unfair to reach back into the past and measure the
    respondents’ decommissioning work by contemporary safety standards, here the
    conclusion turned on the forseeability factor. I stress what I noted above,
    that the view of all the witnesses was that a mistaken delivery was foreseeable
    at the time. Second, it is worth mentioning that no limitations issue was
    raised in this case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having concluded that the respondents breached the
    standard of care owed to the Bingleys, I would not disturb the trial judge’s apportionment
    of liability as between the parties.  Her
    apportionment was supported by her findings regarding the carelessness of
    McDougall and Morrison Fuels.</p>

    in assessing the standard of care and whether there was a breach, she considered
    reasonable foreseeability taking into account the precautionary measures that
    were put in place using the Stanzel conversion method. Her findings reflect an
    assessment that, viewed from a 1979 perspective, using the Stanzel conversion
    method made it factually unlikely that a mistaken oil-fill would occur.
    Accordingly, she found no reasonably foreseeable risk of harm and, weighing all

    colleague and will not repeat them. Simply put the only contested issue at
    trial was whether the appellants breached the standard of care by using the
    “Stanzel method” in converting a residential heating system from oil to gas.
    The Stanzel method involves leaving most of the components of the oil heating
    system in place, but protecting against the risk of an errant delivery by
    turning the exterior oil fill pipe on the home downward, towards the ground,
    and tightening the cap on the fill pipe so it cannot be opened manually. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In addressing the standard of care issue, the trial

    care when she quoted the following <span lang=EN>passage
    from <i>Ryan v.
    <st1:place w:st="on">

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge began her analysis by addressing
    industry practice and regulatory standards. Based on the evidence adduced at
    trial, she found that prior to the 1982 amendments to the <i>Canadian Gas Association Installation Code for Natural Gas Burning
    Appliances and Equipment</i>, CGA B149.1-1976 (the “Code”), which introduced a
    specific requirement that oil fill pipes be removed or plugged when converting
    to natural gas, one of the industry practices in decommissioning an oil fuel
    heating system was turning the fill pipe down to the ground. She also found
    that, as of 1979, the Stanzel method was compliant with the Code. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge turned then to the reasonable
    foreseeability factor. I will repeat her analysis and conclusions for ease of
    reference:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In 1979, industry practice that was <i>Code</i> compliant allowed for tightly
    capped and turned down oil fill pipes as part of a decommissioning method.  The homeowners were able to choose this
    method and did.  Stanzel Plumbing heard
    of no problem associated with this method. In 2001 a fuel oil delivery was made
    by a man who, having been trained in the safe handling of “dangerous goods”
    ignored the most basic safety rule from his training that the fuel was to be
    delivered to the right address.  He never
    checked to see if he had the right address.  He had not been trained as to the significance
    of down-turned oil fill pipes within his delivery area.  Nothing about the state of the residence that
    he should have noticed had he read the delivery ticket or known of the
    significance of those down-turned oil fill pipes, served to give him any
    warning that not only was he at the wrong place, but that place had no fuel oil
    heating system.  He did not ask any
    questions of his office when he noticed the down-turned pipe and its very tight
    cap, even though that option was easily available to him through the use of his
    two-way phone.  He did not seem to
    understand that moving an oil fill pipe as much as he did, even if this had
    been at a home that used furnace oil, could cause leaks in the piping system.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The duty of care and the proper performance of its
    content was an obligation that Stanzel Plumbing owed to the homeowners in
    1979.  It was not a duty of care that
    extended to Morrison Fuels or to any other furnace oil delivery company, to
    save them from making an egregious mistake in the face of all indications to
    the contrary and delivering furnace oil to a place with no oil furnace.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based on this analysis, the trial judge concluded as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In terms of the objective and reasonable foreseeability
    of this kind of harm, I cannot find that an ordinary, reasonable and prudent
    tradesperson in 1979 who is aware of and who complies with the <i>Code</i> and whose choice of measures is
    concurred in by the homeowners would reasonably foresee this kind and degree of
    mistake and negligence by someone who had nothing to do with the homeowners.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><u>In other words, I find that in exercising its
    standard of care owed to the homeowners, Stanzel Plumbing could not have
    reasonably foreseen that a delivery of fuel oil that was not authorized</u> by
    anyone and that was made in the face of many indicators to the contrary <u>would
    be made into that tightened and down-turned oil fill pipe</u>. [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I agree with my colleague’s comments about the trial
    judge’s analysis of the industry practice and regulatory standards factors.
    Although I may not have made the same findings as the trial judge, I see no
    basis on which to interfere with her findings. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I reach the same conclusion on the reasonable
    foreseeability of harm factor. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s conclusion on the reasonable
    foreseeability of harm factor is crucial. She said, “Stanzel Plumbing could not
    have reasonably foreseen that a delivery of fuel oil that was not authorized
    ... would be made into that tightened and down-turned oil fill pipe.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In making this statement, in my opinion, the trial
    judge was focussing on the perceived likelihood, in 1979, of a mistaken
    oil-fill being made when the Stanzel method was used. In the trial judge’s
    view, given the industry standard and practice in 1979, a reasonable person
    would not have conceived of it as possible that a trained oil delivery person
    would make a mistaken oil fill into a turned down fill-pipe with a tightened
    cap. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Put another way, the trial judge concluded that, viewed
    from the perspective of 1979, there was no reasonably foreseeable risk of a
    mistaken oil-fill when the Stanzel conversion method was used because the
    Stanzel method protected against the perceived risk of harm created by leaving
    the oil heating system components in place. In other words, using the Stanzel
    method met the standard of care.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> As I see it,
    this reflects a legally correct approach to the reasonable foreseeability of
    harm factor at the standard of care and breach stage of the negligence
    analysis. In effect, it involves assessing reasonable foreseeability taking
    account of the measures that were adopted (in this case, the Stanzel method) to
    avoid a perceived risk of harm (in this case, the risk of an oil delivery man
    arriving at the wrong address and mistakenly filling a decommissioned heating
    system with oil). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Taking account of her finding that the Stanzel method
    was an industry practice and Code compliant, the trial judge concluded that,
    viewed from a 1979 perspective, there was no foreseeable risk of a mistaken oil
    fill when the Stanzel method was used. That was the trial judge’s call to make.
    Her conclusion was open to her on the record. I would not interfere with it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My colleague relies on <i>Assiniboine South School Division No. 3 v. Greater Winnipeg Gas Co. </i>(1971),

    that the extent of damage and its manner of incidence need not be reasonably
    foreseeable to found liability. My colleague concludes that the trial judge
    erred by approaching the case on the basis of whether a particular chain of
    events was reasonably foreseeable rather than considering whether, in general,
    a mistaken delivery of oil was reasonably foreseeable. In my opinion,

    the unusual chain of events that occurred, as I have said, in my opinion, her
    core finding was that, viewed from a 1979 perspective, there was no foreseeable

    reflects an appreciation that the risk of harm was a mistaken oil fill and a
    conclusion, based on the evidence, that using the Stanzel method would negate

    the standard of care. My concern is that applying the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Assiniboine</i> principles
    could result in holding defendants to a standard of perfection.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, it is important to bear in mind the stage
    of the negligence analysis one is at when applying negligence jurisprudence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Supreme Court of Canada summarized the stages of
    the negligence analysis in <i>Mustapha v.
    Culligan of Canada Ltd.</i>, [2008] 2 S.C.R. 114, at para. 3: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A successful action in negligence requires that the
    plaintiff demonstrate (1) that the defendant owed him a duty of care; (2) that
    the defendant’s behaviour breached the standard of care; (3) that the plaintiff
    sustained damages; and (4) that the damages were caused, in fact and in law, by
    the defendant’s breach.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Tort Law</i>,
    4th ed. (Toronto: Thomson Carswell, 2008) at p. 468, Professor Lewis N. Klar points
    out that analytical confusion can arise from the fact that the foreseeability
    of harm factor forms part of the analysis in relation to duty, standard of care
    and proximate cause (legal causation or remoteness). Moreover, he appears to
    sound a note of caution concerning the use of proximate cause (legal causation or
    remoteness) jurisprudence in relation to standard of care issues;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The fact that <i>foreseeability
    of harm is a component of duty, breach and proximate cause and thus can create
    analytical confusion</i> is illustrated in <i>Resurfice
    Corp. v. Hanke</i>, [2007] 1 S.C.R. 333, reversing (2005), 53 Alta. L.R. (4th)
    219 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ),
    affirming (2003), 333 A.R. 371 (Q.B.). The trial judge found that the risk that
    an operator of an ice-resurfacing machine could confuse the water and gasoline
    tanks of the machine was not foreseeable; hence the manufacturer of the machine
    was not negligent in its design of the machine. This is an issue of breach. The
    Court of Appeal, on the other hand, saw the issue of foreseeability of the risk
    of harm as one relating to proximate cause, and applied the jurisprudence
    relating to that issue. I would agree with the trial judge’s approach; the
    issue was one relating to breach. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In conclusion, I am not persuaded that the trial judge
    committed any reversible legal error in her approach to the standard of care
    analysis and I see no palpable and overriding error in her findings. In any
    event, I question my colleague’s application of <i>Assiniboine</i> in this case, given that the live issue in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <i>Assiniboine</i> was
    remoteness and in this case it is the standard of care. </p>
