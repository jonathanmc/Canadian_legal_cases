    old son, Anthony, to the respondent, Evelyn Zaya.  The trial judge also ordered Homsi to pay monthly
    spousal support of $250 per month with a review after 3 years, guideline child
    support of $333 per month based on imputed annual income of $36,000, plus $100

    ignoring his <i>de facto</i> custody of
    Anthony in awarding custody to Zaya; (ii) awarding, without any evidentiary
    foundation, child support based on an imputed income, and a further amount for
    extraordinary expenses; (iii) awarding spousal support even though Zaya was voluntarily
    unemployed; and, (iv) awarding Zaya an equalization payment without any
    evidentiary support for the valuation of the property in issue.  </p>

    that the judgment be set aside in its entirety and that custody of Anthony be granted
    to him (with access to Zaya).  He seeks an
    order quashing the child support order and an order that Zaya pay him child
    support in accordance with the guidelines.  He also asks for an order quashing the spousal support order and rescinding
    the award of outstanding arrears of child and spousal support, as well as an
    order quashing the equalization order.  Finally,
    Homsi requests an order replacing the trial judge’s costs order with one in his
    favour on a substantial indemnity basis.</p>

  <h2>FACTS</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Homsi and Zaya were married in 2003.  Zaya had a daughter, aged 12 at the time of
    the trial, from a previous marriage. Anthony was born on July 2, 2004. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>During the marriage, Zaya was employed as a
    hairdresser.  However, due to health
    problems during her pregnancy, she did not work between September 2003 and
    February 2006.  In February 2006, she
    accepted employment as a manager of a jewelry store at an annual salary of
    approximately $19,000.  Until December
    2005 when he lost his job, Homsi worked as a car salesman.  After that, he was largely unemployed
    although he did find sporadic work at a gas bar and tried unsuccessfully to
    make a living in a submarine sandwich shop venture.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In 2004, the couple bought a house for $220,000
    with a mortgage of $215,000. In the mortgage application, Homsi reported his
    income as over $63,000.  The decrease in the
    family’s income during 2006 caused the couple to incur financial problems.  The mortgage on their home went into arrears
    and other debts accumulated.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The marriage began to deteriorate in the fall of
    2006.  In December of that year, Homsi
    removed Anthony from the matrimonial home and took him to his parents’
    residence. Zaya went to live with her parents.  In January 2007, Homsi moved to
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Montreal
    to find work and to be near family members. He took Anthony with him.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='"Times New Roman"'>In January 2007, Homsi agreed to sell
    the matrimonial home to a man he met by chance at an Auto Mart. Title to the
    property was transferred in consideration for the assumption of the mortgage
    and other debts. No money changed hands.  The land transfer tax statement on the transfer showed that there was
    $201,927 outstanding on the mortgage.  The transfer documentation included a statement by Homsi that he was not
    a spouse. Around the same time, Homsi also sold most of the home furnishings.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>During 2007 when Homsi and Anthony were in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Montreal, Zaya tried to
    find her son, but experienced difficulties with lawyers she retained for this
    purpose.  Eventually she retained a
    lawyer who helped her to obtain an order that gave her access to her son over
    Christmas of 2007.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Homsi had commenced his application for divorce
    and associated relief early in 2007.<span style='"Times New Roman"'>  The trial took place over two days in March 2008.  At the time of the trial, Homsi was working
    in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Montreal for
    $12.00 per hour.  His T4s indicated that
    he was earning roughly $19,000 per year.  Zaya had quit her job at the jewelry store in order to qualify for legal
    aid.  She was receiving support from Ontario
    Works.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><b><span style='"Times New Roman"'>THE TRIAL JUDGMENT</span></b></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='"Times New Roman"'>After setting out the facts reviewed
    above, the trial judge first dealt with the issue of the division of net family
    property. With the limited information available, the trial judge found that
    there was at least $18,000 of equity in the former matrimonial home.  He arrived at this number by calculating the
    difference between the amount outstanding on the mortgage when the purchasers
    assumed it ($202,000), and the value of the mortgage that the purchasers placed
    on the property less than two months later ($221,616). The trial judge accepted
    counsel’s submission that the costs of the sale of a comparable house would be
    approximately $14,000.  He found that the
    value of the house at the time of separation was $230,000.  From this amount, he subtracted first the
    amount outstanding on the mortgage ($202,000) and then the costs of disposition
    ($14,000), to arrive at the conclusion that there was $14,000 remaining equity
    in relation to the house.  Homsi also
    sold many of the furnishings of the matrimonial home and did not take great
    issue with Zaya’s submission that these items were worth $25,000. Homsi said he
    used the proceeds of the sale of the furnishings to pay mortgage arrears and
    utilities bills for the matrimonial home, but he did not produce any documentation
    to support this. Accordingly, the trial judge determined that Homsi received at
    least $10,000 from the sale of the furniture for which he did not account.
    Adding $10,000 in proceeds from the furnishings to the $14,000 in equity in the
    house, the trial judge arrived at a net family property value of $24,000.   Zaya was
    entitled to half this amount.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge next turned to the issue of
    custody.  In his reasons, the trial judge
    remarked upon Homsi’s unilateral decision to “seize custody” of Anthony and take
    him to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Montreal.  He also noted Zaya’s close involvement with Anthony
    during the first few years of his life.  In
    addition, the trial judge briefly canvassed the plan that each parent offered for
    Anthony’s care.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge concluded that it would be in
    Anthony’s best interests for Zaya to have custody.  In support of this conclusion, the trial
    judge expressed his concern about the dearth of evidence that Homsi offered in
    support of his plans for Anthony.  On the
    other hand, the trial judge noted Zaya’s qualities as a mother and took into
    consideration the benefit to Anthony in residing with his sister.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Turning to support, the trial judge considered Homsi’s
    evidence that at the time of separation, he was earning approximately $19,000
    per year.  He referred to Homsi’s 2007
    financial statement, which stated that he was at that time earning
    approximately $30,000.  The trial judge
    also noted that in order to obtain a mortgage in 2004, Homsi had indicated an annual
    income of $62,000.  The trial judge
    concluded that Homsi was capable of earning more than $19,000, taking into
    account his ability to sell cars and his apparent intelligence.  He imputed to Homsi an income of $36,000 and accordingly
    ordered him to pay guideline support in the amount of $333 per month.  He also ordered $100 per month in
    extraordinary expenses.  The reasons
    contain no explanation for this aspect of the child support order.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Lastly, the trial judge ordered the payment of
    monthly spousal support to Zaya in the amount of $250 per month, finding that
    she suffered an economic disadvantage as a result of the breakdown of the
    marriage.   There were no reasons in support of the amount
    of this order.</p>
  <h2>ANALYSIS </h2>
  <h2><i>1.         Whether the trial judge
    erred in awarding custody of Anthony to Zaya</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Homsi submits that the trial judge erred by not
    giving proper weight to Homsi’s de facto custody of Anthony for one year in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Montreal.  This is his primary ground of appeal.  He argues that Zaya acquiesced in his
    decision to move to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Montreal
    with Anthony and to start a new life there.  He suggests that the evidence demonstrates that Zaya made no real effort
    to interfere with this arrangement.  Homsi also argues that there is no evidence to support a finding that
    Anthony’s interests would not be best-served by maintaining the status quo.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In his analysis of the main issue raised at
    trial – custody of Anthony – the trial judge identifies his obligation to
    decide custody on the basis of Anthony’s best interests.  He then dispenses with this obligation in a
    single paragraph.  He finds that there is
    inadequate evidence about Homsi’s plan for the child.  He then comments on Zaya’s difficulties with
    the legal system during the year when Anthony was with Homsi in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Montreal and rejects the
    suggestion that her efforts to find her son were inadequate.  He further notes that Homsi was “less than
    forthcoming” in providing access to Zaya during this time. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>He finds Zaya to be a competent mother in
    relation to her daughter and observes that the court should strive to keep
    siblings together.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Unfortunately, the trial judge’s reasons do not do
    much to elucidate the basis upon which the ‘best interests of the child’
    determination was made.  Section 16(8) of
    the <i>Divorce Act,</i> R.S.C. 1985, c.3 (2<sup>nd</sup> Supp.) provides that in any custody decision, the court shall take into
    consideration only the best interests of the child by reference to the
    conditions, means, needs and other circumstances of the child.  Section 24(2) of the <i>Children’s’ Law Reform Act</i> R.S.O. 1990, c. C.12, illuminates this
    concept by providing a list of considerations of the needs and circumstances of
    the child.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Unfortunately, the reasons include neither any explicit
    mention of the guidelines nor any analysis that implicitly refers to them.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;
'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>But that is not the end of the inquiry.  Case law confirms that a trial judge’s
    reasons should not be viewed on a stand-alone basis. What is required on appeal
    is an examination of whether the reasons, considered in the context of the
    entire record, show that the trial judge has “seized the substance of the
    matter”: <i>R. v. R.E.M.</i> (2008), 235
    C.C.C. (3d) 290 (S.C.C.), at paras. 43-44. In my view, the question is,
    therefore, whether the record demonstrates that the trial judge implicitly, and
    adequately, considered the best interests of Anthony.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>An examination of the reasons in the context of
    the record reveals evidence that is capable of supporting the trial judge’s
    conclusion that it was in Anthony’s best interests to award custody to Zaya.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The record includes evidence about Zaya’s close
    relationship with her son before the parties separated.  The reasons address the ability of each
    person to parent and to provide for the child, as well as each parent’s plans
    for Anthony’s upbringing.  In commenting
    upon the absence of access when Anthony was in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Montreal, the trial judge  implicitly considers the benefit to Anthony in
    maximum contact with both parents </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Turning to Homsi’s argument that the trial judge
    erred by not considering the status quo, I note two things.  First, the trial judge may well have
    considered the status quo and simply failed to refer to it in his reasons.  Second, status quo is merely one factor among
    many, and it is less important where the other parent was previously the
    primary caregiver.  There is evidence
    that such was the case here.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This court's power of appellate review only
    allows intervention where there is a material error, serious misapprehension of
    the evidence, or an error in law. None of these elements is present in relation
    to the trial judge’s conclusion that Anthony’s best interests would be served
    if his mother had custody.  I would
    therefore not disturb the trial judge’s finding in this regard.</p>
  <h2><i>2.         Whether the trial judge erred in awarding child support on
    the basis of an imputed income</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Homsi submits that the trial judge imputed income
    to him without evidentiary foundation. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I agree.  The approach mandated by this court in <i>Drygala v. Pauli</i> (2002), 61 O.R. (3d) 711 requires a consideration
    of whether the spouse is intentionally unemployed or under-employed, and, if so,
    what the appropriate income is under the circumstances. The onus is on the person
    requesting an imputation of income to establish an evidentiary basis for such a
    finding.  Here, the trial judge cited
    only historic and unproven evidence in support of imputing an income of $36,000
    to Homsi.  In my
    view, the trial judge’s observation that Homsi was intelligent and had the
    ability to sell cars (in Quebec when he does not speak French) was not evidence
    capable of supporting the inference that Homsi was intentionally under-employed
    and that an annual income of $36,000 was reasonably imputed to him. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The only reliable evidence concerning Homsi’s
    income was presented in the form of his T4 slips.  These demonstrated an annual income of
    approximately $19,000.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial
    judge’s reasons supplied no foundation for imputing $36,000, as opposed to any
    other amount, to Homsi.  It follows that
    the child support order of $333 per month cannot stand.  Counsel for Homsi submitted, and counsel for
    Zaya did not respond, that the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Quebec
    table amount applies.<a href="#_ftn2"
name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a>  However, since no submissions were made
    respecting Zaya’s income, a factor that must be considered in computing the
    Quebec table amount, and since any difference in Anthony’s support based on
    what is in the record with respect to the incomes of Zaya and Homsi, would be
    minimal, I would order, as the trial judge did, that Homsi pay Zaya in
    accordance with the Ontario table amount. Any future variations to the child
    support amount should, however, be made in compliance with the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Quebec table
    amounts.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I would therefore
    order that Homsi pay Zaya $164 per month in child support retroactive to March
    18, 2008.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There was also
    neither evidence nor analysis to support the award in the amount of $100 per
    month for extraordinary expenses.  I
    would accordingly set that order aside.</p>
  <h2><i>3.         Whether the trial judge
    erred in awarding spousal support to Zaya</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Zaya submits that appellate courts should only
    interfere with a lower court decision awarding support if the trial judge made
    a material error. The trial judge held that Zaya suffered an economic
    disadvantage from the marriage because she was not working for 18 months after
    Anthony was born and would have been employed if the marriage had not broken
    down.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The trial judge provided no reasons in relation
    to this part of his judgment.  Accordingly, it is open to this court of make its own assessment of
    whether Zaya is entitled to support, for how long, and in what amount. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='"Times New Roman"'>Moge
    v. Moge</span></i><span style='"Times New Roman"'>, [1992] 3 S.C.R. 813 (at para. 74)<i> </i>establishes that since there is no automatic entitlement to spousal
    support, the evidence must be examined.  There was no evidence to support a finding
    that Zaya had suffered economic disadvantage as a result of the marriage.  The marriage was not long, and there was nothing
    to suggest that Zaya suffered disadvantage as a result of the marriage. In
    fact, her employment record during the marriage was stronger than Homsi’s. Moreover,
    the trial judge ignored Homsi’s limited ability to pay support. The law is
    clear that priority should be given to support for Anthony.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Homsi contends that the trial judge awarded an
    equalization payment in the absence of any evidentiary support with respect to
    either the value of the house or the furnishings.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While it is true that there is a paucity of
    evidence in this regard, the onus is on the party asserting the value of an
    asset that he or she controls to provide credible evidence as to its value: <i>Conway v.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Conway</i>, [2005] O.J. No. 1698 (S.C.J.) at
    para.14.  Homsi had control of the items
    in question since he took possession of the matrimonial home and proceeded to sell
    it without Zaya’s consent. It was open to the trial judge to draw an adverse
    inference from Homsi’s failure to produce an updated financial statement or an assessment
    of the property in support of his position. While the factual foundation for
    the trial judge’s numerical calculations, as well as his ultimate assessment of
    value of the net family property, are rather opaque, I appreciate that he was
    not provided with much assistance in this regard.  The trial judge’s determination that Zaya was
    entitled to an equalization payment of $12,000 was supported by the limited
    evidence available to him.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

    part.  I would vary the Judgment below in
    accordance with these reasons. Specifically, I would set aside the spousal
    support order and the order requiring Homsi to pay $100 for Anthony’s extraordinary
    expenses.  I would award monthly child
    support in the amount of $164.  These
    changes to Homsi’s support obligations will be effective as of March 18, 2008. Any
    arrears of support payments due under the judgment below will be
