    was not a reportable disease under the <i>Health
    of Animals Act</i>, and CFIA had no policy on it.  Indeed, it appears that this was the first
    time DT104 had been isolated in a layer hatchery.  Still, CFIA was aware that this strain of
    salmonella was potentially dangerous because it was resistant to most commonly
    used antibiotics.  And it was concerned
    that DT104 could pose a significant human health risk if the hatchery chicks
    were infected by it when they began laying eggs.  If that were the case, the salmonella could
    be transmitted from the infected chicks to the inner contents of their eggs.  Because of this concern CFIA asked Health
    <st1:country-region

    <st1:place

    to conduct a prompt and competent investigation into whether DT104 had infected
    its flock, the motion judge did apply the <i>Anns</i> test.  As will become apparent, I
    disagree with his application of that test, especially with his analysis of the
    requirement of proximity.</p>
  <h3>(i)        Reasonable
    foreseeability</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge found (at para. 38 of his reasons)
    that CFIA knew River Valley’s flock would start laying approximately 100,000
    eggs daily by the end of November 2001.  In his view, CFIA “should and could foresee that
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">
    River
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Valley
    had to know as soon as possible whether or not that product would be condemned
    or saved”.  He therefore concluded that
    the requirement of foreseeability was made out: “CFIA inspectors and officers
    could readily foresee that
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    River
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Valley was among those

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The Attorney General challenges this conclusion.  However, on the record before him, I think

    <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">

    <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">
    River
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Valley
    had established proximity.  In his view,
    CFIA owed a duty of care not only to the public at large but also to individual
    farmers.  Its duty to
    <st1:PlaceType
w:st="on">
    River
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">

    arose when it “targeted” or “singled out”

    <st1:PlaceType

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge’s conclusion on proximity rested on
    four planks: the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in <i>Hill v. Hamilton-Wentworth Regional Police Services Board</i> (2007),
    285 D.L.R. (4th) 620; his finding that River Valley was “targeted” for
    investigation; his finding that River Valley had no choice but to rely on
    CFIA’s investigation and to assist CFIA in carrying out the testing; and the
    investigative powers and obligations imposed on governmental authorities in
    several federal statutes.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In this court,
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">
    River
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Valley
    relied on the reasoning of the motion judge.  It also relied on the recent judgment of the New Brunswick Court of
    Appeal in <i>Adams et al. v. Borrel et al.</i> (2008), 336 N.B.R. (2d) 223, where that court held that the Attorney General of
    Canada owed a private duty of care to potato farmers in New Brunswick to
    conduct a timely investigation into whether a deadly virus was infecting their
    crops.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my opinion, <i>Hill</i> lends no support to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    River
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Valley’s position.  In <i>Hill</i> the majority of the court recognized the tort of negligent investigation, and
    held that a police officer owes a duty of care to a suspect that the officer is
    investigating. 
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    River
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Valley contends that similarly, CFIA
    owed it a duty of care when CFIA investigated the possibility of DT104
    contamination of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    River
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Valley’s flock.  However, I see no similarity between <i>Hill</i> and this case for two reasons.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First, the holding in <i>Hill</i> is narrow.  The Supreme
    Court found that a relationship of proximity arose in the context of a criminal
    investigation where the accused’s liberty interests and <i>Charter</i> rights are at stake.  At para. 27 of her majority judgment, Chief Justice McLachlin adverted
    to the narrowness of her holding:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Before moving on to the analysis of proximity in
    depth, it is worth pausing to state explicitly that this judgment is concerned
    only with a very particular relationship – the relationship between a police
    officer and a particularized suspect that he is investigating.  There are particular considerations relevant
    to proximity and policy applicable to this relationship, including: the
    reasonable expectations of a party being investigated by the police, the
    seriousness of the interests at stake for the suspect, the legal duties owed by
    police to suspects under their governing statutes and the <i>Charter</i> and the importance of balancing the need for police to be
    able to investigate effectively with the protection of the fundamental rights
    of a suspect or accused person.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By contrast,
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    River
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Valley’s proximity claim
    was made in a non-criminal investigation where only its economic interests were
    at stake.  Any liberty interests it might
    have had were not threatened and it asserted no <i>Charter</i> rights.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, in <i>Hill</i> the police were investigating harm that had already occurred.    Thus,
    the officer’s investigation focused on assigning criminal responsibility to a
    particular suspect.  Here, CFIA sought to
    prevent future harm.  It was reacting to
    a potential threat, the severity and extent of which was unknown.  Its investigation focused more broadly on
    preventing harm to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario
    consumers from the spread of contaminated eggs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Recently, in <i>Correia
    v. Canac Kitchens</i>, 2008 ONCA 506, this court extended the potential reach
    of <i>Hill</i> to the relationship between a
    private security firm retained by an employer to investigate theft and drug
    dealing by its employees, and the specific employee being investigated.  In my view, <i>Correia</i> also does not support
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">
    River
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Valley’s
    claim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Correia</i>,
    the employer, Canac, relying on the security firm’s investigation, accused the
    plaintiff of theft and fired him for cause.  However, the plaintiff was innocent; Canac had accused the wrong
    man.  This court overturned the motion
    judge’s summary dismissal of the negligent investigation claim against the
    private security firm.  Rosenberg and
    Feldman JJ.A. concluded that whether the private security firm owed the
    plaintiff a private duty of care raised a triable issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My colleagues justifiably saw similarity between the suspect’s
    high interest in the police investigation of him, and the employee’s interest
    in the private security firm’s investigation.  In each case the individual’s reputation, dignity and “how he may spend
    a good portion of his life” were at stake.  And my colleagues noted that the private security firm, like the police,
    was investigating criminal wrongdoing.  They concluded, at para. 47, “where, as here, the private firm performs
    a function analogous to the public police, they ought to be subject to similar
    liability.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The relationship between employee and private security
    firm in <i>Correia</i>, like the
    relationship between suspect and police in <i>Hill</i>,
    is far different from the relationship between
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">
    River
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Valley
    and CFIA.  None of the considerations that
    raised a triable issue on proximity in <i>Correia</i> exist in this case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge also found that proximity could be
    established because
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    River
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Valley had been
    “targeted” for investigation. “Targeting” distinguishes this case from other cases where public authorities
    charged with responsibility for protecting the health of the public have been
    held not to owe a private duty of care to affected individuals.  One example of these other cases is <i>Eliopoulos (Litigation Trustee of) v.
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    Ontario (Minister of Health and Long-Term Care)</i> (2006), 82 O.R. (3d) 32 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  There, the family of a man who contracted
    West Nile Virus from an infected mosquito and later died, sued the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario government in
    negligence for failing to prevent the outbreak of the virus.  In dismissing the claim on a pleadings
    motion, Sharpe J.A. held that
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario’s
    statutory duties under the <i>Health
    Protection and Promotion Act</i> did not establish proximity.  The government’s discretionary powers under
    the statute were to be exercised in the general public interest.  They did not create a private law duty.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Eliopoulos</i> no individual was targeted for investigation.  Similarly, this court recently held that the federal government’s
    regulation of breast implants and temporolmandibular joints (TMJ implants) did
    not give rise to a private duty of care to individuals harmed by these
    implants.  See <i>Attis v.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    (Health)</i>, 2008 ONCA 660 and <i>Drady v.

    2008 ONCA 659.  In these cases too, the
    regulating authority did not target a specific person.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I accept that when a government agency targets an
    enterprise for investigation that might suggest some relationship between the
    two.  But proximity under the <i>Anns</i> test requires something more: it
    requires a sufficiently close and direct relationship making the imposition of
    a private duty of care fair and just.  Mere targeting in the context of a statutory regime under which a
    government agency is responsible for preventing and controlling the spread of
    disease in the interest of animal and public health is not enough to establish
    proximity.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The motion judge further supported his finding of

    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    River
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">

    proximity.  Moreover, the record shows

    recommendation (made through the Ontario Board) that its flock be destroyed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally, the motion judge held that the governmental
    powers and obligations under s. 27 of the <i>Canada
    Agricultural Products Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. 20 (4th<sup> </sup>Supp.), s. 23
    of the <i>Food and Drugs Act</i>, and s. 45
    of the <i>Health of Animals Act</i> “demonstrate a legislative intent to impose upon the defendants an obligation,
    or duty of care, not only to the public at large but also to individual
    farmers”.  Although the motion judge was
    correct in looking at the legislation to determine whether it reflected a
    parliamentary intent to give farmers a private remedy, the three provisions he
    relied on largely did not come into play in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 23 of the <i>Canada
    Agricultural Products Act</i> authorizes an inspector to “seize and detain any
    agricultural product or other thing”.  Section 27 regulates how long a thing seized may be detained.  However, neither
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceType

    River
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 23(1) of the <i>Food and Drugs Act</i> authorizes an inspector to enter any place where
    an article is stored.  Subsection (a)
    permits the inspector to examine the article and to take samples; and
    subsection (d) permits the inspector to seize and detain the article “for such
    time as may be necessary”.  Although a
    CFIA inspector did take environmental samples from
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceType

    River
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 45 of the <i>Health
    of Animals Act</i> also deals with the seizure and detention of “an animal or
    thing”, which, again, did not occur in this case.  Indeed, as I view the record in this case,
    CFIA’s inspectors acted under ss. 38(1)(d) and (e) of the <i>Health of Animals Act</i>, which provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>For the purpose of detecting diseases or toxic
    substances or ensuring compliance with this Act and the regulations, an
    inspector or officer may</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>…</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(d) examine any animal or thing in respect of
    which this Act or the regulations apply and take samples of it;</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(e) require any person to produce for
    inspection or copying, in whole or in part, any record or document that the
    inspector or officer believes on reasonable grounds contains any information

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>CFIA took environmental samples from

    <st1:PlaceType

    River
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Valley’s
    flock and tested them.  It neither seized
    nor detained the flock.  The motion judge
    misapprehended the record by relying on the seizure and detention provisions of
    the <i>Health of Animals Act</i> and the
    other two federal statutes to establish proximity.  Moreover, as I will discuss, even if there
    had been a seizure or detention, I am not convinced that either would give rise
    to a private duty of care.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where, as in this case, a governmental authority
    exercises discretionary power under a statutory regime, proximity must be
    determined by looking at the relevant statute.  The relevant statute in this case is the <i>Health of Animals Act</i>.  It is
    the only source of CFIA’s duties.  See <i>Cooper v. Hobart</i> at para. 43.  The ultimate question is whether this statute
    discloses a legislative intention to exclude or confer a private law duty of
    care.  In my view, the <i>Health of Animals Act</i> discloses an
    intention to exclude a private law duty.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although the motion judge considered the <i>Health of Animals Act</i>, he erred by not
    properly taking into account its purpose, its statutory compensation scheme,
    and its immunity clause.  These three
    compelling factors show the absence of proximity between CFIA and
    <st1:place

    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    River
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">

    and instead show that CFIA’s duty is to the public as a whole, not to
    individual farmers or egg producers.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The purpose of the statute can be gleaned from its long
    title, an act “respecting diseases and toxic substances that may affect animals
    or that may be transmitted by animals to persons, and respecting the protection
    of animals”.  In <i>Vona v.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    (Minister of Agriculture)</i> (1996), 30 O.R. (3d) 687, at p. 691, this court
    noted that the purpose of the <i>Health of
    Animals Act</i> is to enable the Crown to protect the health of people and
    animals.  Nothing in this statute
    suggests that one of its purposes is to protect the economic interests of
    individual farmers.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Inspectors charged with tracking the spread of
    infectious disease inevitably must focus their investigations on persons or sites
    where exposure or contamination has potentially occurred.  In carrying out their investigations,
    inspectors appointed by CFIA have broad discretionary powers to inspect
    enterprises, even seize and detain and quarantine animals.  In exercising these broad powers, inspectors
    are not obliged to be mindful of the economic interests of individual
    farmers.  Their overriding concern is the
    protection and promotion of human and animal health.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The statutory compensation scheme in s. 51 of the <i>Health of Animals Act</i> also points to the
    absence of proximity.  Section 51(1)(a)
    authorizes the Minister of Agricultural to order compensation out of the Consolidated
    Revenue Fund to an owner of an animal that an inspector has ordered to be
    destroyed:<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Minister may order compensation to be paid from
    the Consolidated Revenue Fund to the owner of an animal that is</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a)  destroyed

    this Act and dies after the requirement is imposed but before being destroyed;</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(b)  injured
    in the course of being tested, treated or identified under this Act by an
    inspector or officer and dies, or is required to be destroyed, as a result of
    the injury; or</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(c) reserved for experimentation under
    paragraph 13(2)(a).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 51(2) fixes the amount of compensation payable:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Subject to subsections (3) and (4), the amount of
    compensation shall be </p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a) the market value, as determined by the
    Minister, that the animal would have had at the time of its evaluation by the
    Minister if it had not been required to be destroyed</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>minus</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(b)       the
    value of its carcass, as determined by the Minister.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Once compensation has been paid under s. 51, then s. 9
    of the <i>Crown Liability and Proceedings
    Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-50 applies.  That provision bars an action against the Crown in respect of any claim
    for which statutory compensation has been paid:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>No proceedings lie against the Crown or a servant
    of the Crown in respect of a claim if a pension or compensation has been paid
    or is payable out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund or out of any funds
    administered by an agency of the Crown in respect of the death, injury, damage
    or loss in respect of which the claim is made.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>   By enacting a
    statutory compensation scheme in s. 51, Parliament addressed the concern that
    the economic interests of individual farmers may be harmed by CFIA’s
    actions.  A farmer whose animal is
    destroyed under a CFIA order or is injured during CFIA testing is entitled to
    apply for compensation.  At the same time,
    the combination of s. 51 of the <i>Health of
    Animals Act</i> and s. 9 of the <i>Crown
    Liability and Proceedings Act</i> demonstrate an express legislative intent to
    preclude an action for negligence against CFIA where statutory compensation has
    been paid.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover, a farmer cannot bypass the underlying intent
    of the scheme in s. 51 by refusing to apply for compensation from the
    Consolidated Revenue Fund.  In other
    words, a farmer whose animal is ordered destroyed or is injured during testing
    cannot refuse to apply for statutory compensation and by doing so maintain CFIA
    owes a private duty, the breach of which entitles the farmer to damages in the
    Superior Court.  The farmer must seek
    compensation under the Act.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus, River Valley’s claim comes down to this
    proposition: when CFIA takes the drastic action of ordering the destruction of
    an animal, it owes no private duty of care; yet, when CFIA takes less drastic
    action, as it did in this case, it then owes a private duty to an individual
    farmer.  That proposition, respectfully,
    is illogical. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>River Valley was not without options: it could have tried
    to pursue CFIA’s recommendation to divert its eggs to pasteurization and thus
    minimize its losses; it could have tried to claim statutory compensation on the
    footing that CFIA’s actions amounted to a “constructive” destruction order; or
    it could do what it eventually did – obtain compensation from the industry fund,
    which is a residual safeguard for farmers, and from its own insurers.  The one option

    <st1:PlaceType

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The statutory immunity clause in s. 50 of the <i>Health of Animals Act</i> further shows an
    absence of proximity.  Section 50 shields
    CFIA inspectors from lawsuits for actions taken in carrying out their statutory
    duties:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Where a person must, by or under this Act or the
    regulations, do anything, including provide and maintain any area, office,  laboratory or other facility under section
    31, or permit an inspector or officer to do anything, Her Majesty is not liable</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a)       for
    any costs, loss or damage resulting from the compliance; or</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(b)       to
    pay any fee, rent or other charge for what is done, provided, maintained or
    permitted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section 50 is a broad immunity clause.  Unlike many other statutory immunity clauses,
    it is not even qualified by an express requirement that to be entitled to its
    protection, inspectors must be acting in good faith. 
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    River
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Valley seeks to get out
    from under s. 50 by contending that it applies only when CFIA’s inspectors
    carry out their duties properly and does not apply when they act
    negligently.  That contention makes no
    sense.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By this wording, s. 50 protects inspectors whether or
    not they are at fault.  Moreover, it is
    precisely when they are alleged to be negligent that they will likely need to
    rely on this protection.  In <i>Vona</i> this court held that s. 50,
    standing alone, completely barred any action for negligence.  Here, it is unnecessary to decide whether
    some actions of CFIA inspectors may not be covered by s. 50.  At the very least, s. 50 strongly points to a
    legislative intent to preclude a private law duty.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Last, I will deal briefly with the New Brunswick Court
    of Appeal’s decision in <i>Adams</i> –
    relied on by
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    River
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Valley – which seems at
    odds with my conclusion on proximity.  In
    that case, as I said earlier, the court held, at para. 2, that the Attorney
    General of Canada owed provincial potato farmers a “<i>prima facie</i> duty of care to conduct a timely investigation with
    respect to identifying the source of [a potato] virus and that that duty was
    not negated … by overriding policy considerations…”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However, there is one important difference between the
    statute in issue in the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    New Brunswick
    case, the federal<i> Plant Protection Act</i>,
    S.C. 1990, c. 22, and the statute in issue in the case before us, the <i>Health of Animals Act</i>.  The difference lies in the purpose of each
    statute.  Under s. 2 of the <i>Plant Protection Act</i>, the federal
    government’s statutory obligation is “… to protect plant life and the
    agricultural … [sector] of the Canadian economy by preventing the… spread of
    pests”.  From this provision, Robertson
    J.A. found, at para. 44, that “an immediate purpose of the legislative scheme
    is to protect the agricultural sector of the economy by protecting the
    interests of farmers”. In the light of this finding, Robertson J.A. concluded that
    “it would be disingenuous to hold that no <i>prima
    facie</i> duty of care was owed to this group of entrepreneurs”.  The <i>Health
    of Animals Act</i> shows no legislative purpose to protect the interests of
    individual farmers.  The different
    legislative purposes of the two statutes alone distinguish the claim in <i>Adams</i> from
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceType

    River
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Valley’s
    claim.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I am obliged to add, however, that s. 38 of the <i>Plant Protection Act</i> is a statutory
    immunity clause similar to s. 50 of the <i>Health
    of Animals Act</i>, and that s. 39 of the <i>Plant
    Protection Act </i>provides for statutory compensation similar to the
    compensation provided for in s. 51 of the <i>Health
    of Animals Act</i>.  In Robertson J.A.’s view,
    ss. 38 and 39 were provisions for the trial judge to consider in assessing
    damages.  In my view, ss. 50 and 51 are
    very relevant to the determination of proximity.  To that extent our analyses differ.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I conclude that the legislative purpose of the <i>Health of Animals Act</i>, together with the
    provisions for statutory compensation in s. 51 and statutory immunity in s. 50,
    in combination, show an absence of proximity.  Thus, CFIA did not owe a <i>prima
    facie</i> duty of care to

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although unnecessary to my conclusion that no private
    duty of care exists, I see at least one overriding policy consideration that
    also negates a private duty.  That
    consideration is the potential for conflict if CFIA must be mindful not only of
    the health of animals and the public, but as well the economic interests of
    individual farmers.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    Valley submits that no
    conflict can exist because the public, CFIA and individual farmers all have the
    same interest: to ascertain the absence or presence of disease or
    contamination, in this case DT104.  As
    testing is scientific and objective, all interested and affected parties will
    consider themselves bound by the results.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I take a different view.  In some instances, and this case is perhaps a
    good example, the potential for conflict between the economic interests of an
    individual farmer and the public interest does exist.  The conflict may arise over the extent of the
    testing necessary to determine whether an animal is diseased.  In this case, initial testing of
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    River
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Valley’s
    barn 4 showed no DT104 in any of the samples.  With those negative test results in hand and having regard to its own
    economic interests,
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    River
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Valley may well have
    fairly claimed that it should have been able to market its eggs.  However, CFIA, with the benefit of Health
    Canada’s expertise, took a more cautious approach in the public interest, and
    insisted on further testing at the point where the hens were about to lay their
    eggs.  CFIA fairly claimed that this
    further testing was needed to be fully satisfied that the flock in barn 4 was
    not contaminated.  Undoubtedly other
    kinds of conflict may arise if CFIA inspectors have to worry about the economic
    interests of individual farmers as well as their obligation to the public to
    protect human and animal health.</p>
