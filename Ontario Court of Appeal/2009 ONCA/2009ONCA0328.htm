    Canada owned the Shares and that Sands Canada was represented by Laidlaw &amp;
    Co. Ltd. (“Laidlaw”).  In late October 2005,
    Mr. Lalani contacted Mr. Hugh Regan at Laidlaw to express UBS’ interest in
    acquiring the Shares.  He was told that
    the Shares were not for sale.  Mr. Regan
    advised Mr. Sands of the contact.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On November 14, 2006, Mr. Lalani called Mr. Regan again
    to ask whether the Shares were available for purchase.  Mr. Regan told him that Sands Canada owned
    the Shares and directed Mr. Lalani to speak to Mr. Sands.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Lalani’s telephone calls were timed by UBS’
    telephone logs, but his words were not recorded because he was trading for the
    house.  Each call that Mr. Lalani made to
    Mr. Sands followed this pattern: Mr. Lalani would call a receptionist at
    Laidlaw and the receptionist would then transfer the call from Mr. Lalani to
    Mr. Sands’ office.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That same day (November 14, 2006), Mr. Lalani called
    Mr. Sands and spoke with him.  In this
    conversation, Mr. Sands confirmed that he controlled Sands Canada, had the
    authority to sell the Shares, and indicated that he might be interested in so
    doing.  Mr. Lalani said that based on
    recent transactions reported in the press, UBS would pay $50 per share for the
    Shares.  Mr.&nbsp;Sands speculated on why
    the Shares might have appreciated so much and asked Mr. Lalani to send him some
    research.  Mr. Sands also asked Mr.
    Lalani to document the bid in an email.  He gave Mr. Lalani his email address and asked that he correspond with
    him through that.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At this time, Mr. Lalani had access only to publicly
    traded information about Bourse.  The
    same information would have been readily available to Sands Canada. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Lalani followed up with an email that day (November
    14, 2006), in which he confirmed UBS’ indication of interest in purchasing the
    Shares at C$50 per share.  The email went
    on to say: “If you are interested in this price level then we can discuss the
    steps we need to take to move forward, if possible”.  He also sent some information on Canadian
    economic trends.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is standard practice in the securities industry for

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On November 21, 2006, Mr. Lalani placed five calls to
    Mr. Sands.  He spoke with him on two
    occasions.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first call in which the two actually spoke took
    place at 13:50 and lasted two minutes and twelve seconds.  The trial judge found that the following took
    place during this call.  Mr. Lalani asked
    Mr. Sands whether he had decided to accept the offer and Mr. Sands responded
    that he was interested but wanted to settle the transaction in 2007 for tax
    reasons.  Mr. Lalani told Mr. Sands that
    his proposal was acceptable and they agreed to settle the transaction on
    January 3, 2007.  Mr. Sands asked if he
    should contact Credit Suisse for another bid or another institution for an
    independent valuation and Mr. Lalani told Mr. Sands that he should do what he
    felt was necessary.  Mr. Sands said that
    he wanted to get out of the transaction before settlement, if a material event
    affecting the value of the shares was announced before settlement.  Mr. Lalani had not seen a “material event
    out” clause before so he said that he would speak with his superior.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Lalani spoke to his supervisor, Mr. Finemore, about
    the material event out clause.  Mr.
    Finemore told him that, consistent with UBS’ practice, it would not give Sands
    Canada such a clause.  Mr. Lalani reported
    this to Mr. Sands in the second phone conversation they had on November 21,
    2006.  This second conversation took
    place at 14:02 and lasted for six minutes and six seconds.  The trial judge found that during this call,
    Mr. Lalani asked Mr. Sands if they had a deal at $50 per share for 100,000
    shares settling on January 3, 2007, even though UBS would not offer a material
    event out clause and Mr. Sands indicated that they had a deal and UBS should
    “draw up the papers”.  Mr. Lalani told
    Mr. Sands that in reliance on the agreement, UBS would be entering into an
    agreement with a third party to dispose of the Bourse shares that exceeded the 10%
    limit (the “Third Party Sale”).  According to Mr. Lalani, Mr. Sands said that he understood.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Between the end of this conversation at 14:08 and
    14:29, Mr.&nbsp;Lalani reported to Mr. Finemore on the arrangements he had made
    with Mr. Sands.  Mr. Finemore asked Mr.
    Lalani to confirm that he had completed a transaction to purchase the Shares. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At 14:29, Mr. Lalani sent an email to Mr. Sands, with a
    copy to Irene Winel, UBS’ chief compliance officer.  The email reads as follows: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Please confirm that Sands Brothers Canada / Laidlaw
    &amp; Company has agreed to sell 100K shares of the Montreal Exchange for C$50
    per share to UBS with settlement on January 3, 2007.  Please find attached the documents required
    to be completed by the seller in order to facilitate the sale of the Montreal
    Exchange shares.  Our point person for
    completing the transaction is Irene Winel (416-814-1445).  She will draw up the share purchase agreement
    that will incorporate the agreed terms.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The documents attached to the email set out the Bourse
    requirements for a transfer of shares.  Among other things, the documents indicated that the seller had to
    provide the share certificates and board of directors’ resolutions.  Ms. Winel testified that before this email
    was sent, Mr. Lalani told her that he had made a deal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After sending the email message, Mr. Lalani made three

    times.  The first two telephone calls lasted
    66 and 18 seconds respectively.  In
    neither did Mr. Lalani speak to Mr. Sands.  The third call, at 14:30, lasted 48 seconds.  The trial judge accepted Mr. Lalani’s
    evidence that during this call, Mr. Sands acknowledged and accepted the terms
    of the agreement, discussed the possibility of settling the transaction in
    <st1:place

    <st1:country-region w:st="on">U.S.</st1:country-region>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr. Sands testified that Mr. Lalani agreed to send him a
    draft shareholder’s agreement for his review and that it was premature to
    discuss completing an agreement or the terms.  The trial judge did not accept this evidence, stating that she preferred
    the evidence of Mr. Lalani.  </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>UBS immediately commenced legal proceedings.  It brought an application, returnable on
    December 14, 2006, in which it sought a declaration that Sands Canada had unconditionally
    agreed to sell 100,000 Bourse common shares to it for C$50 per share, for
    settlement on January 3, 2007.  It also asked
    the court to order specific performance of the agreement. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A trial took place on December 20 and 21, 2006.  The trial judge found in favour of Sands
    Canada.  However, on May 29, 2007, this
    court set aside the judgment and remitted the matter for a new trial.  An application for leave to appeal to the
    Supreme Court of Canada was dismissed on November 29, 2007.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The second trial took place before Pepall J. (the “trial
    judge”) on April 23, 24 and 25, 2008.  It
    proceeded on the same basis as the first, namely, that the witnesses’
    affidavits would constitute their examinations in chief.  The witnesses were Mr. Lalani and Ms. Winel
    for UBS, and Mr. Sands for Sands Canada.  At the commencement of trial, the parties agreed that the notice of
    application and the affidavits constituted the pleadings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge gave thorough, thoughtful reasons for
    judgment.  She found that an oral
    agreement was made between the parties and reiterated in the telephone call on November
    22, 2006, at which time Mr. Lalani confirmed that Mr. Sands, on behalf of Sands
    Canada, agreed to sell the Shares to UBS for C$50 per share, with settlement to
    take place on January 3, 2007 (the “Agreement”).  She found that in reliance on the Agreement,
    the parties proceeded to draft closing documents and UBS entered into the Third
    Party Sale.  She also found an
    anticipatory breach of the Agreement on the part of Sands Canada, and ordered
    that the Agreement be specifically performed.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On May 1, 2008, the Bourse merged with the Toronto
    Stock Exchange.  As a result of the
    merger, Sands Canada became entitled to 136,187 TSX shares and $4,876,995.33 in
    cash.  It received the shares and cash on
    May 2, 2008. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In a supplementary order dated May 14, 2008, the trial
    judge made detailed orders on how to implement the order for specific
    performance of the Agreement.    She
    ordered Sands Canada to transfer to UBS 136,187 common shares of the TSX and to
    pay to UBS the sum of $4,876,995.33.  UBS
    was ordered to deliver to Sands Canada the $5 million purchase price under the
    Agreement, plus pre-judgment interest.  In addition, Sands Canada was ordered to pay to UBS the amount it had
    received by way of dividends on the shares from January 3, 2007, to April 30,
    2008, inclusive of pre-judgment interest. </p>

    concluding that a binding agreement had been made and that she erred in law in
    ordering specific performance.    </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>THE TRIAL DECISION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As has been mentioned, the trial judge gave thorough,
    thoughtful reasons for decision.  After setting
    out the facts in detail, she reviewed certain basic principles of contract
    formation.  Those principles can be summarized
    as follows.  For a contract to exist, there
    must be a meeting of minds, commonly referred to as consensus ad idem.  The test as to whether there has been a meeting
    of the minds is an objective one – would an objective, reasonable bystander conclude
    that, in all the circumstances, the parties intended to contract?  As intention alone is insufficient to create
    an enforceable agreement, it is necessary that the essential terms of the
    agreement are also sufficiently certain.  However, an agreement is not incomplete simply because it calls for the
    execution of further documents.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge applied the law and found that a
    reasonable person would conclude that the parties intended to contract to
    effect a trade whereby Sands Canada would sell the Shares to UBS for C$50 per
    share, to settle on January 3, 2007.  Her
    reasons for reaching that conclusion are contained in paras. 45 through 50 of
    the decision, the key aspects of which read as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Firstly, both parties were sophisticated securities
    industry participants.  Mr. Sands had
    been in the industry for 28 years.  While
    Mr. Lalani had only worked at a securities trading desk for three years, during
    that time he had been involved in hundreds of trades.  It is customary in the securities industry,
    in both proprietary trading and trading as an agent for third parties, to
    consummate trades by verbal agreement.  This trade involved a proprietary trade and consistent with the custom,
    the parties intended to make a trade.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Secondly, I did not find Mr. Sands to be
    credible.  Where his evidence and that of
    Mr. Lalani conflict, I prefer Mr. Lalani’s evidence to that of Mr. Sands.  His affidavit which constituted his evidence in
    chief was conveniently lacking in particulars even though it was sworn shortly
    after the events in issue.  In his
    cross-examination, he seemed to have little recall of many of the events and
    there were instances where his evidence before me initially differed from that
    given at the first trial. …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I am also satisfied that an agreement was reached
    between the parties and was reiterated when Mr. Lalani and Mr. Sands spoke by
    telephone on November 22, 2006 at which time Mr. Lalani confirmed that Mr.
    Sands had agreed to sell 100,000 shares of the Bourse for $50 per share to
    settle on January 3, 2007.  I do not
    accept that there was no offer or acceptance or that the length of the various
    conversations would preclude such discussions.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There was also reliance on the agreement made.  The parties proceeded to draft documents for
    closing and at no time did Sands Canada take issue with the terms of the
    agreement reached or raise the material event out clause.  In reliance on the agreement, UBSSC
    contracted with a third party.  Mr. Sands
    was told on November 21, 2006 that in reliance, UBSSC would be entering into a
    third party agreement because of the Bourse’s 10% holding limit. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge then considered whether the essential
    terms of the agreement could be determined with a reasonable degree of
    certainty.  She concluded that they could.
     In para. 54 of the reasons, she explains:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p class="headingNUMBER" style="line-height:normal;">Having accepted Mr.
        Lalani’s evidence over that of Mr. Sands’, I am satisfied that the parties were
        ad idem on the parties, the purchase price, the absence of any material out
        clause, and the date of closing.  I do
        not view the place of closing and the representations and warranties to be
        essential terms as between the two parties to the agreement.  In this regard, I note the evidence on the custom
        and practice in the securities industry to the effect that the essential terms in
        a share purchase agreement are the number of shares, the price and the closing
        date.  As to whether currency of payment
        was in Canadian or US funds, Mr. Sands inquired as to the currency and Mr.
        Lalani responded that this was not a problem.  There was agreement on currency – it just had
        not been specified.  In my view, the lack
        of specification was not material.  The
        purchase price had been determined and it was C$50 per share with settlement to
        take place on January 3, 2007.   </p>
    </blockquote>
  </blockquote>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge viewed the 10% limit on Bourse shares as
    an “issue of mechanics” in the sense that the Bourse approval requirements were
    simply a mechanism to facilitate the transfer of its shares.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge referred again to the fact that the
    evidence demonstrated that it was customary in the securities industry to
    consummate trades by verbal agreement and without such a custom, the industry
    could not operate effectively.  She
    concluded in para. 58:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my view the parties entered into a binding
    enforceable contract in which Sands Canada agreed to sell 100,000 shares of the
    Bourse for $50 per share with a closing date of January 3, 2007.  Both parties committed themselves to the
    essential and material terms of the agreement and both reasonably expected to
    be bound to the terms they agreed to.  Having concluded that the deal he made was not sufficiently
    advantageous, Mr. Sands reneged on the agreement.  With not a shred of evidence to support his
    position, he alleged that UBSSC had insider information and then tried to
    concoct a version of events in an effort to avoid his bargain.  In my view, Sands Canada should be held to
    the agreement reached.  UBSSC asserted
    that Sands Canada was in anticipatory breach of its agreement with UBSSC.  No issue was taken with that position and I
    accept UBSSC’s submission in that regard.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge then considered the appropriate remedy.  She noted that Bourse was set to merge with
    the Toronto Stock Exchange and that Sands Canada had not carried on business in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    since 2002.  Further, its only asset was
    the Shares, and the share certificates were held in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    New York City.  She recited UBS’ concerns about Sands Canada’s
    ability to meet any financial commitments flowing from these legal proceedings.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge articulated the legal principles that
    inform the exercise of discretion in ordering specific performance of a
    contract for the sale of shares.  She saw
    the present case as similar to <i>W.C.
    Pitfield &amp; Co. Ltd. v. Jomac Gold Syndicate Ltd.</i>, [1938] O.R. 427
    (C.A.), in that UBS had pursued its claim for specific performance with “extraordinary
    dispatch” and entered into the Third Party Sale in reliance on the
    Agreement.  In light of the “special
    circumstances” of the case and the “substantial and legitimate interest represented
    by an order for specific performance”, she concluded that “there is a fair,
    real and substantial justification for granting” an order for specific
    performance of the Agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge distinguished the facts in the present
    case from those in <i>Asamera Oil Corp. v.
    Sea Oil and General Corp.</i>, [1979] 1 S.C.R. 633.  In <i>Asamera</i>,
    the litigation had been in the courts for 18 years whereas UBS had moved quickly.  Further, UBS was not speculating at Sands
    Canada’s expense.  In addition, the
    shares in question were not publicly traded until March 2007.  Before then, they traded on the grey market
    and valuation problems were likely to arise if an assessment of damages was
    required.  Furthermore, the Third Party
    Sale, although conditional, was a binding agreement with implications for UBS’
    reputation.     </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Effectively, Sands Canada argues that the trial judge
    misapprehended the evidence on two points. First, it submits that the trial
    judge was incorrect in her finding that Mr. Lalani’s email to Mr. Sands on
    November 21, 2006, preceded Mr. Lalani’s conversation with Mr. Finemore that
    same day.  Sands
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    argues that this error is
    significant because UBS took the position that the Agreement arose from the
    second conversation on November 21, 2006 at 14:02.  In Sands Canada’s submission, the fact that
    Mr. Finemore wanted confirmation in writing from UBS indicated that UBS did not
    think there was a binding agreement at that time.  Second, Sands Canada submits that the trial
    judge erred in finding that Mr. Lalani said that he was told by Mr. Sands that
    they had a deal during the 14:02 call when that was not his evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would reject both arguments.  The trial judge did not say that Mr. Lalani’s
    email preceded the conversation with Mr. Finemore.  She simply stated that on November 21, 2006,
    “Mr. Lalani reported on the matter to Mr. Finemore who asked him to be doubly
    sure there was a transaction.”  Contrary
    to Sands Canada’s submission, the fact that Mr. Finemore wanted confirmation of
    the Agreement is not inconsistent with the Agreement having been concluded at
    that time.  A confirmation is exactly
    that – confirmation or assurance that a prior agreement had been reached.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the trial judge did not misapprehend Mr.
    Lalani’s evidence regarding the 14:02 call.  The trial judge did <i>not</i> say
    that Mr. Lalani’s evidence was that Mr. Sands told him that the parties had a
    deal on November 21, 2006.  Rather, she
    accepted Mr. Lalani’s evidence that Mr. Sands “indicated” that they had a deal,
    a conclusion which was consistent with what she found to be Mr. Sands’
    unequivocal instruction to Mr. Lalani, during that call, to “draw up the
    papers”.  </p>

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    submits that the trial judge committed a number of other factual errors in
    concluding that the parties reached a binding agreement.  Its arguments may be summarized as follows:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>            1.  Failure to consider
    the 10% limit – the trial judge noted that under the By-laws, a shareholder who
    exceeds the 10% limit can be forced to divest itself of shares in excess of the
    10% threshold.  However, it is submitted
    that she failed to consider that to the knowledge of UBS, in addition to
    requiring a divesture, the By-laws prohibited the acquisition of more than 10%
  of the shares either legally or beneficially.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal;'>            2.  No negotiation as to price – the trial judge
    did not reconcile the lack of negotiation over the price to be paid for the
    Shares despite Mr. Lalani’s admission that he had authority to pay more than
    $50 per share and his testimony that, at the relevant time, the value of Bourse
    shares was estimated to be in the range of $76.  Given Mr. Sands’ experience and background, Sands Canada argues that it
    makes no sense that Mr. Sands would not negotiate the price especially when UBS
    would not agree to a material event out clause.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>            3.  The material event
    out clause – the trial judge believed that the request for this clause was made
    but that it was dropped, for no consideration, in a matter of a few minutes.  She made this finding despite the fact that in
    the same conversation, Mr. Sands said he did not wish to be embarrassed before
    his partner if there was a listing or merger.  This, it is contended, makes no sense and is inconsistent with the trial
  judge’s finding that Mr. Sands was sophisticated in securities matters.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal;'>            4.  Credibility – in rejecting Mr. Sands’
    evidence, the trial judge made a blanket statement that she preferred Mr.
    Lalani’s evidence wherever it conflicted with that of Mr. Sands.  She specifically accepted Mr. Lalani’s
    evidence that he did not offer Mr. Sands alternative language when UBS rejected
    the material event out clause.  Sands
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    claims
    it was not reasonable for the trial judge to have accepted Mr. Lalani’s
    evidence on this point.  Mr. Lalani claimed
    he confirmed the terms of the Agreement, including the lack of a material event
    out clause, the issue of currency and the drafting of an agreement in 48
    seconds, including the time necessary to place the call through Laidlaw.  Having regard to the length of all the calls
    where words were exchanged between the two, Sands Canada says this would have
    been “impossible”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal;'>            5.  No trade ticket – the trial judge did not
    reconcile Mr. Lalani’s failure to book the purchase of the Shares with his
    compliance department.  If he had
    completed a transaction and acquired the Shares, it is claimed, he would have
    had to show the Shares as an asset and reserve the funds to pay for them.  Moreover, the transaction was not recorded by
    a ticket or other means.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal;'>            6.  Third Party
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Sale – the trial judge failed to consider Mr.
    Lalani’s acknowledgement that his affidavit of December 12, 2006, dealing with
    the Third Party Sale was inaccurate.  In
    cross-examination, Mr. Lalani admitted that the Third Party Sale was
    conditional on UBS completing the transaction with Sands Canada.  The Third Party Sale could have been
    completed by selling some of the nearly 800,000 Bourse shares in UBS’
    portfolio.  UBS’ representation that it
    would suffer irreparable harm if it did not complete the Sands Canada purchase
    was not accurate.  Time was not of the
    essence in the Third Party Sale and UBS had already hedged against the
    possibility that it might not complete the Sands Canada purchase.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I do not accept that the trial judge made any of the
    alleged errors.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The first argument is, with respect, simply
    incorrect.  Contrary to Sands Canada’s
    submission, the trial judge did consider that the By-laws prohibited the
    acquisition of more than 10% of the Bourse shares. At para. 8 of her reasons,
    the trial judge noted:  “[t]he Bourse’s
    by-laws require that no entity hold more than 10% of the Bourse’s issued and
    outstanding common shares.”  She later
    referred to the 10% limit several times in her reasons in the discussion of the
    Third Party Sale, the purpose of which was to ensure that UBS complied with the
    10% limit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second, the fact that the trial judge did not expressly
    refer to the absence of negotiation of the price to be paid for the Shares does
    not mean that she committed a palpable and overriding error in finding that the
    parties had concluded an agreement for C$50 per share.  <span lang=EN-US>A trial judge is not obliged to accept all of the evidence before her or
    to advert to every possible argument or defence.  What is essential is that there is evidence
    to support the findings that she </span><span lang=EN-US>does make.  </span>There was considerable evidence to support the trial judge’s
    conclusion that the parties struck an oral agreement in November 2006 at a
    price of C$50 per share.  That conclusion
    was based, in large part, on the trial judge’s credibility findings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge accepted Mr. Lalani’s evidence that the
    parties had concluded an oral agreement and disbelieved Mr. Sands’ evidence
    that the parties were negotiating and moving towards the conclusion of a
    written agreement with a material event out clause.  She offered cogent reasons for her
    credibility findings: see, especially, para. 46 of her reasons, set out above.  In the end, she accepted Mr. Lalani’s version
    of events and found that Mr. Sands adduced evidence, which was “conveniently
    lacking in particulars” and was an effort to “concoct a version of events in an
    effort to avoid his bargain.”  There is
    no reason to interfere with those determinations, especially in light of the
    Supreme Court’s admonition that the task of “[a]ssessing credibility is clearly
    in the bailiwick of the trial judge” and that “heightened deference must be
    accorded to the trial judge on matters of credibility”: <i>F.H. v. McDougall</i> (2008), <span class=ssl2>297 D.L.R. (4th) 193
    (S.C.C.), at para. 72.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The trial judge’s credibility findings provide an
    answer to Sands Canada’s third and fourth arguments.  Based on those findings, the trial judge was
    entitled to infer that Mr. Sands decided against insisting on a material event
    out clause and that the parties were <i>ad
    idem</i> on the lack of such a clause.  Contrary
    to Sands Canada’s submission, that inference is not inconsistent with the trial
    judge’s finding that Mr. Sands was sophisticated in securities matters.  A sophisticated businessperson, such as Mr.
    Sands, may have simply assessed the risk of insisting on a clause which the
    purchaser was not willing to give and determined that it was not worth
    jeopardizing a desired transaction.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, nothing turns on the fact that the telephone
    calls were completed in a short time.  As
    the trial judge found, the transaction was not complicated and the parties were
    sophisticated.  In this context, it is
    reasonable to conclude, as the trial judge did, that the Agreement took a
    relatively short amount of conversation time to be consummated. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fifth, it was Mr. Lalani’s evidence that a trade ticket
    was not required.  For the reasons
    already given, the trial judge was entitled to accept that evidence.       </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sixth, the trial judge took into account that the Third
    Party Sale was conditional on the Agreement between UBS and Sands Canada.  She did not view this as being inconsistent
    with a binding Agreement having been concluded.  The Third Party Sale was made conditional on settlement, not because the
    Agreement had not been completed, but for the practical reason that the source
    of the shares sold under the Third Party Sale was to be the shares obtained
    from Sands Canada rather than UBS’ own inventory.  The fact that UBS could theoretically have
    completed the Third Party Sale by selling shares from its own inventory does
    not detract from the trial judge’s conclusion that the parties had reached a
    binding agreement in November 2006.  Indeed, to conclude otherwise would have been inconsistent with the
    evidence of UBS’ strategy to acquire as many Bourse shares as was legally possible.  </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I would reject this argument.  The trial judge properly relied on the
    uncontradicted evidence of UBS that it is customary in the securities industry
    to make binding agreements orally and that without this custom, the securities
    industry could not operate effectively.  That evidence formed a necessary part of the context of the parties’
    communications and was relevant to determining whether the parties had
    concluded the Agreement in November 2006 or whether they had merely reached an
    agreement to agree.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based in part on this evidence, the trial judge found
    that the parties had concluded the Agreement and that the essential terms were
    the price, quantity of shares and the closing date.  Thus, the trial judge found that a written
    share purchase agreement was not a “condition of the bargain” but merely “an
    indication or expression of a desire as to the manner in which the contract
    already made will be implemented”: <i>Klemke

'>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Contrary to Sands Canada’s contention, the trial judge
    did not conflate these two things.  Rather, she found that the parties had concluded an oral agreement and
    were “ad idem on the parties, the purchase price, the absence of any material
    event out clause, and the date of closing.”  The trial judge offered cogent reasons for accepting Mr. Lalani’s
    evidence and rejecting the alternative version of events put forward by Mr.

    an agreement.  It argues that the trial
    judge erred in referring to Mr. Lalani’s evidence regarding the 14:02 call on

    concluded the second conversation with Mr. Sands on November 22, 2006, he sent
    an email to Mr. Finemore indicating that he had spoken “to Mr. Sands and
    confirmed we have a deal”.   The trial

    contract.  Sands

    from UBS’ perspective as a buyer and can be contrasted with Mr. Lalani’s note
    of November 21, 2006, in which he sought confirmation that Sands Canada had
    “agreed to sell”.  Mr. Sands did not

'>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It is clear that the trial judge did not err in the
    statement of the objective test for whether the parties intended to
    contract.  The trial judge was alive to
    the fact that the test for consensus ad idem is objective.  At para. 40 of the reasons, she recites the
    objective test and then applies it before reaching her conclusion. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor did the trial judge implicitly apply a subjective
    test.  She did not consider Mr. Lalani’s
    evidence regarding the 14:02 call in isolation.  Rather, she considered the totality of the evidence before concluding that
    the objective test had been met and that the parties had agreed to a contract
    on the essential terms in November 2006.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;
'>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In my view, nothing that has been argued undermines the
    trial judge’s conclusion that an objective reasonable bystander would have
    concluded that the parties reached an agreement in November 2006.  To the contrary.  Mr. Lalani’s email to Mr. Sands on November
    23, 2006, is not framed as an offer to purchase but as confirmation of the
    Agreement.  In that email, Mr. Lalani stated
    that, as finalized on November 22, 2006, “<i>UBS
    has agreed to purchase</i> 100K shares of the Montreal Exchange from Sands
    Canada/Laidlaw &amp; Company” (emphasis added).  I fail to see a distinction between a confirmation that UBS had agreed
    to purchase the Shares from Sands Canada and a confirmation that Sands Canada
    has agreed to sell the Shares to UBS.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With respect to the terms in the written draft
    agreement, again, the trial judge’s findings regarding the essential terms of
    the transaction were supported by the evidence of the securities industry
    custom that such agreements are customarily oral and that the essential terms
    of such agreements are the price, quantity and closing date.  It was further buttressed by her credibility determinations.  Given her conclusion that the parties had
    concluded an oral agreement, the “entire agreement clause” in the draft
    purchase and sale agreement was non-essential.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>WAS BOURSE APPROVAL A CONDITION

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A true condition precedent is one that is agreed to by

    depends entirely on the will of a third party”:  see <i>Turney v. Zhilka</i>, [1959]
    S.C.R. 578, at p. 583.  When determining
    whether a contractual term is a “true condition precedent”, the intentions of
    the parties must be considered.  It is a
    question of construction whether the obligations of a contract are absolute and
    immediately binding or are contingent on an external event:  <i>Wu

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On the findings of the trial judge, there was no
    agreement between the parties that Bourse approval of the transfer of the
    Shares was a condition to be satisfied in order for a binding agreement to be
    effective.  On the contrary, the trial
    judge found that the agreement reached by the parties was “unconditional”.  The record amply supports this finding.  </p>

    the Third Party Agreement.  There is
    nothing in the record to suggest that either party made Bourse approval a
    condition precedent to the Agreement.  Indeed, the evidence is to the contrary.  UBS’ conduct indicates that it assumed any risk associated with a
    failure to obtain Bourse approval.         </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Part of Sands Canada’s argument on this issue is that
    the trial judge erred by confusing the 10% limit with the need for Bourse
    approval.  While she discusses both in
    para. 55 of her reasons, I see no such confusion.  The first two sentences of that paragraph
    speak to the 10% limit.  However, in the
    balance of the paragraph, she clearly deals with the matter of Bourse
    approval.  She begins by quoting from
    S.M. Waddams, <i>The Law of Contracts, </i>4th
    ed. (Aurora: Canada Law Book, 1999), at p. 42.  In the current edition,<a href="#_ftn1"

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a> Professor Waddams points out that where the consent of a third party is
    necessary, it may be a condition precedent to an agreement.  However, he goes on to note that “[m]ore
    commonly”, it is justifiable to assume that the approval constituted a
    condition, not of the agreement but of its performance.  The trial judge concluded that the Bourse
    approval requirements were but a mechanism to facilitate the transfer of shares
    – that is, that they were an aspect of performance of the Agreement and not a
    condition to its existence.  On the record,
    there is no justification for interfering with that determination.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>In any event, Sands Canada cannot rely on the lack of

    cannot avoid its bargain by
    arguing that there was an unfulfilled condition precedent of Bourse approval
    when Bourse approval was never sought because Sands Canada refused to tender
    the Shares or provide the required trade execution information to the Bourse.  That is, Sands Canada cannot rely on its own
    failures to take the necessary steps to obtain Bourse approval to deny the
    enforceability of the Agreement: see <i>Dynamic

    principles.  When fashioning a remedy for
    a breach of contract, the object is to place the injured party in the position
    that he or she would have been had the contract been performed.  Typically, damages are ordered.  However, where damages are inadequate to
    compensate an injured party for its losses, specific performance may be
    ordered.  Accordingly, specific
    performance may be ordered where the subject matter of a bargain is unique or
    irreplaceable because, in those circumstances, damages may be inadequate.  The remedy for an anticipatory breach of
    contract is discretionary.  The exercise
    of discretion requires an assessment of the parties’ conduct and the factual
    context.      </p>

      Canada</st1:country-region>
    submits that the trial judge erred in ordering specific performance of the
    Agreement.  Its arguments can be summarized
    as follows.  First, it says that there was
    nothing unique about the Shares which would warrant an order for specific
    performance.  Thus, it submits, the trial
    judge erred in distinguishing <i>Asamera</i> based on her assumption that there was no market for the Shares.  Nor was there evidence to suggest that UBS could
    not prove damages or that damages would be inadequate.  Second, it contends that the trial judge was
    improperly influenced by two factual matters:  the fact that Sands Canada had no assets in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario and a finding that UBS’ reputation
    would suffer if it failed to complete the Third Party Sale.  Third, it argues that the initial error in ordering
    specific performance was compounded by maintaining that order after the Shares
    no longer existed following their conversion into TSX shares and cash.  This, Sands Canada submits, resulted in a
    windfall for UBS, particularly as it relieved UBS of its obligation to comply
    with the 10% limit and of its duty to mitigate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For the reasons that follow, I do not agree.  The order for specific performance was an
    exercise of discretion by the trial judge.  As she applied the correct legal principles and had due regard to the
    relevant factual considerations, I see no basis on which to interfere with that
    exercise of discretion.        </p>

    performance may be ordered in connection with the shares of a private company because,
    as in the present case, such shares may not be readily available on the market
    and valuation can be difficult.  Contracts for the sale of publicly traded shares are also candidates for
    specific performance in circumstances such as those of the present case where
    the vendor is subject to an injunction restraining it from selling the shares,
    the purchaser has diligently pursued its claim for specific performance from
    the outset, and the plaintiff has entered into additional contracts for the
    resale of some of the shares: see </span><i>W.C.

    uniqueness of the property that is the subject of the contract is one,

    performance.  The underlying principle is
    that if the property is unique, it should be delivered up because damages would
    not put the party in the position they would have been in but for the breach.  The trial judge considered this factor and
    concluded that the Shares were unique.  During
    the relevant timeframe (i.e. prior to the public listing of the shares in March
    2007) <span lang=EN-US>there was no readily

    value they had for UBS.  In that regard,
    it will be recalled, UBS had a plan to accumulate as many Bourse shares as

lang=EN-US>I see no error in the trial judge
    having considered Sands Canada’s financial position when deciding the matter of
    remedy.  Whether a defendant is in a
    position to pay damages and, thus, whether the plaintiff is likely to recover
    them, is relevant to the issue of the adequacy of damages.  As Sharpe J.A. states in <i>Injunctions and Specific</i> <i>Performance</i>,
    loose leaf, (
    <st1:City w:st="on">

    aspects of a failure by UBS to conclude the Third Party Sale.  She recognized that the Third Party Sale was
    conditional.  On the record, that was no
    bar to her finding that UBS’ reputation would have been harmed had the
    Agreement not been honored and UBS thereby become unable to perform the Third

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By ordering specific performance, UBS was placed in the
    position that it would have been had the Agreement been performed.  As I have already explained, the trial judge
    was fully justified in concluding that damages were inadequate in the
    circumstances of this case.  Consequently, I do not view UBS as having received a windfall, despite
    what has occurred as a result of the merger of Bourse and the Toronto Stock
    Exchange.  The fact that UBS is no longer
    constrained by the 10% limit does not mean the Third Party Sale is not
    enforceable.  However, the enforceability
    of the Third Party Sale agreement is a matter between UBS and the third party,
    not UBS and Sands Canada.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The case
    law provides a full answer to the argument that UBS was unfairly benefited as
    it had no duty to mitigate.  In <i>Asamera</i>, Estey J. explained that in circumstances
    where there is a prompt claim for specific performance and a fair, real and
    substantial justification for the claim, the plaintiff may not be required to
    acquire replacement property.  At pp.
    667-68 of <i>Asamera</i>, he stated:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>On
    principle it is clear that a plaintiff may not merely by instituting
    proceedings in which a request is made for specific performance and/or damages,
    thereby shield himself and block the court from taking into account the
    accumulation of losses which the plaintiff by acting with reasonable promptness
    in processing his claim could have avoided.  Similarly, the bare institution of judicial process in circumstances
    where a reasonable response by the injured plaintiff would include mitigative
    replacement of property, will not entitle the plaintiff to the relief which
    would be achieved by such replacement purchase and prompt prosecution of the
    claim.  <i>Before a plaintiff can rely on a claim to specific performance so as to
    insulate himself from the consequences of failing to procure alternate property
    in mitigation of his losses, some fair, real, and substantial justification for
    his claim to performance must be found</i>. [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><span
lang=EN-US>He continued at pp. 668-69:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i><span
lang=EN-US>[I]n the case of anticipatory
    breach, there is a substantial and legitimate interest in looking to
    performance of a contractual obligation.  So a plaintiff who has agreed to purchase a particular piece of real
    estate, or a block of shares which represent control of a company, or has
    entered into performance of his own obligations and where to discontinue
    performance might aggravate his losses, might well have sustained the position
    that the issuance of a writ for specific performance would hold in abeyance the
    obligation to avoid or reduce losses by acquisition of replacement property.</span></i><span
lang=EN-US>  Yet, even in these cases, the action for performance must be instituted
    and carried on with due diligence.  This
    is but another application of the ordinary rule of mitigation which insists
    that the injured party act reasonably in all of the circumstances. Where those
    circumstances reveal a substantial and legitimate interest in seeking
    performance as opposed to damages, then a plaintiff will be able to justify his
    inaction. [Emphasis added.]  </span></p>

    UBS was entitled to specific performance.  On the record, there is no reason to interfere with that
    determination.  UBS elected to seek
    specific performance in the face of Sands Canada’s anticipatory breach.  Its application to enforce the Agreement was
    brought with “extraordinary dispatch”.  As has already been mentioned, a block of 100,000 Bourse shares was not
    readily available at the date the contract was breached.  The trial judge found, in the circumstances,
