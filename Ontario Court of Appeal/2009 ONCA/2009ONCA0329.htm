style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On February 15, 2006, the respondents were
    arrested and charged with a very serious sexual assault.  The complainant alleged that the respondents
    forced vaginal, anal and oral sex on her while she was incapacitated from the
    consumption of alcohol. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On March 4, 2008, the trial judge stayed the
    charges against both respondents on the basis that their rights to a trial
    within a reasonable time under s. 11(b) of the <i>Charter</i>  <i>of Rights and Freedoms </i>had been breached.  There had been a delay of approximately 25
    months from arrest to the scheduled trial date.  The Crown appeals the imposition of the stay.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I would allow the appeal.  With respect, I conclude that the trial judge
    erred in two regards.  First, he failed
    to take into account that at least 7 ½ months of the delay related to the
    intake of the case in the Ontario Court of Justice and in the Superior
    Court.  That delay was properly
    characterized as part of the inherent time requirements of the case and should
    have been treated as neutral in determining whether the delay was
    unreasonable.  Second, the trial judge
    appears to have isolated the delay in the Superior Court and focused on its
    reasonableness rather than examining the reasonableness of the total delay from
    arrest to the scheduled trial date.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When one removes the intake time from the delay
    calculation, the remaining time, 17 ½ months, comes within the upper end of the
    guidelines suggested by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. Morin</i>, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 771 for cases such as this where there
    is a preliminary hearing and a trial in the Superior Court.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On the interpretation of the facts most
    favourable to the respondents, approximately nine of the 17 ½ month delay was
    caused by late Crown disclosure.  That
    delay should not have occurred.  Nonetheless, given the strong societal interests in having these serious
    charges tried, the absence of any trial fairness prejudice to the respondents
    and the fact that the delay, including that caused by late disclosure, does not
    exceed the <i>Morin</i> guidelines, I am of
    the view that the stay should be set aside and a new trial ordered.</p>

    went to a party with the two respondents.  In the early morning hours of February 12, she was in the basement of
    the respondent Geene’s house.  She was
    intoxicated.  She alleges that the
    respondents subjected her to vaginal, anal and oral sex without her
    consent.  She only remembers parts of the
    sexual assault.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0 align=left style='text-align:left;

    complainant went to a local hospital to have a tampon which had been lodged
    inside of her during the assault removed.  She had been unable to remove it herself.  At the time, she did not disclose to her
    mother, who accompanied her to the hospital, or to the medical professionals
    attending her, that she had been sexually assaulted.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The complainant returned to

    <st1:City

    St. Joseph’s Hospital on Wednesday, February
    15, at which time further swabs were taken for the purpose of detecting

    testing relating to sexually transmitted diseases.</p>

    hearing proceeded and was completed on November 20 as scheduled.  At the preliminary hearing, by agreement, the

    pre-trial in the Superior Court was scheduled for January 4, 2007 and an
    assignment court date was fixed for February 2, 2007.  The pre-trial was adjourned to the assignment
    court date.  At the assignment court on
    February 2, counsel for the respondents sought an adjournment to March 19, 2007
    for two reasons: the transcript of the preliminary hearing had not been
    completed and the report from the Centre of Forensic Sciences (“CFS”) relating
    to the sexual assault evidence kit was not available.  I will come back to the history of the
    disclosure problems in some detail below.  </span></p>

    indicated that it expected to have the CFS report by that date.  </span></p>

    pre-trial.  On that date, the Crown gave
    an oral report to defence counsel saying that the forensic testing did not show
    the presence of semen.  However, as a
    result of the Crown’s failure to provide the written CFS report, the pre-trial
    was cancelled and the June trial date was vacated.  The trial was then set for September 20,
    2007.  </span></p>

    <st1:City w:st="on">
    St. Joseph’s
    Hospital.  The result was that the trial
    did not proceed on September 20.  A
    number of exchanges took place between the Crown and the respondents about
    disclosure.  The trial was eventually re-scheduled
    for March 17, 2008.  </span></p>

    swabs on February 15.  Those swabs were
    not taken for the sexual assault evidence kit, but rather were for the purpose

    sexual assault evidence kit, the test results of which were still outstanding,

    not able to explain the reason for the delay, although it appears to have been
    a failure on the part of the Ontario Provincial Police (the “OPP”).  The Crown counsel at trial conceded that the
    delay resulted from negligence.  There is

    days later, on May 30, 2007, the CFS report was finally delivered to the OPP.  However, further delay occurred as the OPP
    did not deliver the CFS report to the Crown until August 8, 2007.  The report had apparently been left on a
    retired officer’s desk.  On the same day
    the Crown received the report, the Crown provided copies to counsel for the
    respondents.  The results showed that no
    semen had been found on the swabs taken on February 13, 2006.  </span></p>

    have been resolved through agreement or by court order in ample time to have
    allowed the trial to proceed during the week of June 11, 2007, when it was
    first scheduled for trial in the Superior Court.  On that view of the facts, I do not think it
    is necessary to assess the various communications among the Crown, the
    respondents and the courts following the week of June 11, 2007.  All of what transpired thereafter would not
    have been necessary had there been timely disclosure.  Thus, the nine months between June 11, 2007
    and the scheduled trial date of March 17, 2008 should be viewed as having been

    language of Lamer J. in <i>R. v. Mills</i>,

    straightforward and the delay “<i>far

    assignment court date was set for February 2, 2007 in the Superior Court.  Initially, a pre-trial was scheduled for
    January 4, 2007, but for reasons that are not entirely clear, that date was
    adjourned to the assignment court on February 2, 2007.</span></p>

    February 2, 2007, the defence were not prepared to set a trial date for two
    reasons: the transcript of the preliminary hearing was not prepared and the
    Crown had not disclosed the CFS report.  If on that date the transcript of the preliminary hearing had been
    prepared and the Crown disclosure been completed, one can assume the parties
    would have been ready for trial and prepared to set a trial date.  Thus, it seems to me that the 2 ½ month
    period between the preliminary hearing and the assignment court was a
    reasonable time in which to expect the Superior Court to take in a new case and
    a period  which the parties could use to
    prepare for trial.</span></p>

    deducting the 7 ½ month intake period from the total delay of 25 months, there
    remains a delay of 17 ½ months.  The trial
    judge attributed “any delay” beyond the <i>Morin</i> guidelines to the Crown’s failure to make disclosure in a timely manner.  In my view, approximately nine of the 17 ½
    month delay was caused by the Crown’s failure to make disclosure in a timely
    fashion.  The balance was systemic or
    institutional delay.  Nonetheless, in my

    a view of the facts most favourable to the respondents, only nine of the 17 ½
    month delay can be attributed to the Crown’s late disclosure.  The preliminary hearing was scheduled and
    completed without delay caused by the lack of disclosure.  The 4 months between July 17, 2006 – when the
    date for the preliminary was set – and November 20, 2006 – when the preliminary
    hearing was heard – is properly characterized as institutional or systemic
    delay.</span></p>

    in the Superior Court, the case was put on the assignment court list for
    February 2, 2007.  As discussed above, it
    was adjourned to March 17 to set a date for trial because of two things: the
    transcript of the preliminary was not complete and the results of the CFS tests
    had not been produced.  Given that the
    transcript had not been completed, it seems likely that even if disclosure had
    been made, the case would have been put over to the March date to set a date
    for trial.  On March 17, the trial date
    was set for the week of June 11, 2007.  Thus, even if the Crown had made timely disclosure, it is fair to
    conclude that the earliest trial date would have been in the week of June 11,
    2007.  In my view, the time between the
    assignment court on February 2, 2007 and the first trial date during the week
    of June 11, 2007 – 4 ½ months – should be considered institutional or systemic
    delay.  </span></p>

    June 11, 2007 to the trial date of March 17, 2008 – should be attributed to the
    Crown’s late disclosure of the CFS report.  There is no explanation for the Crown’s delay in disclosure other than what
    the Crown Attorney said in his submissions – it was due to negligence.  By that, I take the Crown to have meant it
    was inadvertent.  While the delay cannot
    be explained or justified, there is no suggestion that it was intentional or
    that the police or the Crown had any ulterior motive in not ensuring that there
    would be timely disclosure.  </span></p>

    question arises whether it makes a difference when applying the <i>Morin </i>guidelines that a portion of the
    delay was caused by the Crown’s late disclosure rather than by institutional or
    systemic factors.  The trial judge’s
    conclusion that the delay was unreasonable appears to have been driven in large
    part by the fact that the delay was caused by the Crown’s actions.  He noted that if the task were to “simply
    balance the societal interest in the trial against prejudice to the
    defendants”, then the “application should be dismissed”.  However, there were other “issues at play”
    that related to the “conduct of the prosecution” which he earlier described as

    is important to note that the purpose of s. 11(b) is not to assign blame to

    v. Conway</i>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1659…, at pp. 1673-74…, L’Heureux-Dubé J. for
    the majority said:</span></p>

    justice.  </i></span></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>These words echo the comments of
    Lamer J. in <i>R. v. Mills</i>, [1986] 1

    seven-person court (the majority not addressing the point):</span></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'><span
lang=EN-US>The purpose of s. 11(b), however, is

    negligence or inadvertence is of little import….</span></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=left style='text-align:left'>The function
    of the doctrine of abuse of process is, therefore, in my view entirely distinct
    from that of s. 11(b).  While reduction
    in official misconduct may be a consequence of s. 11(b), this is not its
    purpose.  In the eyes of the individual
    accused, it matters little whether the delay is imputable to the authorities or
    not; what truly matters is the extent to which the delay will impair his or her
    interests.  Section 11(b) does not to any
    extent represent an entrenchment or an extension of the common law doctrine of
    abuse of process.  [Emphasis in original,

    reason why a court, when considering delay caused by the Crown’s late
    disclosure, should not have regard to the <i>Morin</i> guidelines in assessing the reasonableness of the delay.  The seriousness with which one views Crown
    conduct causing delay or indeed the seriousness of the systemic or
    institutional reasons causing delay may vary from case to case.  The focus of the exercise under s. 11(b),
    however, is on the impact of the delay on the accused and society, not on
