  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
    if we were to agree with the appellants’
    submission that the trial judge erred in her interpretation of the exclusionary
    clause for a pre-existing condition, she nonetheless reached the correct
    result.  The relevant portions of the exclusionary clause read as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In addition to the General Exclusions shown on
    page 18, this Insurance does not provide payment for indemnity for expenses
    incurred directly or indirectly as a result of: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Any Pre-existing Condition as defined on page 25
    except as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b><i>Applicable to persons 60 to 69 years</i></b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>on
    trips 15 days or less;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>on
    trips over 15 days, any condition which has remained Stable in the 180 days
    prior to the commencement date of a covered trip.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“Pre-existing
    condition” is defined as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>… a medical condition, illness or Injury known
    to the Insured Person, and for which an Insured Person has received medical
    consultation, diagnosis, and/or Medical Treatment by a Physician prior to
    the commencement date of a covered trip and includes a medically recognized
    complication or Recurrence of a medical condition.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“Stable” is
    defined as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>“Stable” means the medical condition is not worsening
    and there has been no alteration in any medication for the condition or its
    usage or dosage, nor any Medical Treatment prescribed or recommended by a
    Physician or received, within the period specified in this Policy before
    the commencement date of a covered trip.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    he purchased the insurance, the respondent indicated that the trip was to
    last 28 plus 7 days and he paid the appropriate premium.  Because the illness
    occurred toward the beginning of the trip, the respondent cut his trip short
    and returned within either 14 or 16 days of departure, depending on one’s
    interpretation of the evidence.  The trial judge concluded that the exclusionary
    clause did not apply because the trip only lasted 14 days and the trip length
    provision in the exclusionary clause should be interpreted to mean the actual
    length of the trip rather than the length of the trip as planned and contracted
    for.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    have assumed without deciding that trip length, for the purpose of the exclusionary
    clause, is determined by reference to the trip length stipulated in the policy
    (i.e. 28 days plus 7) and that therefore the exclusion did apply to the respondent.  Making
    that assumption, on the facts of this case, we find that the appellants did
    not meet their onus to show that the exclusionary clause was triggered.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent suffered from hypertension.  In the weeks prior to his departure
    he was placed on a third medication for this condition and the dosage of
    one of the medications he was taking at the time was increased.  However,
    as indicated in the hospital records filed in evidence, the respondent did
    not have a history of coronary artery disease.  The appellants led no evidence
    to establish that the respondent’s angioplasty procedure undergone in
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Florida was “incurred directly or indirectly” as a result of the respondent’s
    pre-existing hypertension.  Absent such evidence, the exclusionary clause
    did not provide a basis for the appellants’ denial of the claim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    see no basis to set aside the trial judge’s finding that, on the facts of
    this case, the stress test undergone by the respondent was not a “medical
    consultation” received for a medical condition known by him.  The cardiologist
    who monitored the test testified that he did not regard the procedure as
    a consultation.  The respondent received the results of the stress test before
    his departure and they disclosed no abnormality.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    light of our conclusion with respect to the trip length provision in the
    exclusionary clause, we need not deal with the appellants’ submission that
    the trial judge erred in her factual determination that the respondent returned
    to
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    within 14 days of departure.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the trial judge’s refusal to allow the appellants to call evidence respecting
    mitigation and
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Florida law is a discretionary ruling and we see no basis for interfering
    with it.  As noted by the trial judge, the evidence sought to be adduced
    had no relevance based on the pleadings and the appellants had not served
    a motion to amend their pleading.  The appellants had been aware of the issues
    of mitigation and the limitation period but failed to plead them.  If an
    amendment had been allowed at that stage of the trial, expert’s reports on
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Florida law would have been required and the respondent would inevitably
    have been prejudiced and delays and further expenses would have been incurred.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    a result, the appeal is dismissed.  Costs to the respondent on a partial
    indemnity basis fixed at $9,000, inclusive of GST and disbursements.</p>
