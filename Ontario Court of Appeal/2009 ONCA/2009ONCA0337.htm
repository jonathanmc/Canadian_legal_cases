style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    December 10, 2002, the appellants and several co-employees were in an elevator
    in a building owned by the respondent, West Arthur Place Limited.  The elevator
    was maintained by the respondent, Nor-West Elevator Co. Ltd.  The appellants
    and their co-workers got into the elevator and it proceeded to the ground
    floor.  The door did not open entirely and the elevator moved back up to
    the sixth floor.  It then dropped to the fifth floor, stopped momentarily
    and then dropped further.  It eventually came to rest between the second
    and the third floors.  The appellant, Beerthuizen, jumped down to the second
    floor and injured her ankle.  The appellant, Favuzzi, remained in the elevator.  She
    had, however, injured her back when it jolted to a halt.  Both sued the respondents.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    case was tried by a judge and jury.  The jury found against the appellants
    on liability.  They assessed Favuzzi’s damages at $36,733.35 and they assessed
    the damages of Beerthuizen at $78,293.15.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    plaintiffs’ expert testified that in his view a prior incident involving
    the elevator had been caused by a speed control malfunction.  He offered
    the opinion that this problem had not been corrected and must have reoccurred
    causing the incident involving the appellants. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants and several other people in the elevator testified about the incident.  They
    insisted there was no horseplay by anybody in the elevator prior to the incident.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    defence experts testified that on their examination of the relevant records
    and the elevator, the elevator had been properly maintained prior to the
    incident.  They also testified that they could find no evidence of any mechanical
    or other problems with the elevator that could have caused the incident.  By
    a process of elimination, the experts concluded that there must have been
    some external cause of the malfunction such as the misconduct of the passengers
    in the elevator.  </p>
  <h2>THE LIABILITY APPEAL</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for the appellants advance four grounds of appeal.  Three arise out of the
    charge to the jury and one concerns an evidentiary ruling made by the trial
    judge.</p>
  <h2>(i)  Did the trial judge err in failing to review the evidence relating
    to the defence position that the incident was caused by the misbehaviour
    of the occupants in the elevator?</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge put the respective positions of the plaintiffs and the defence
    to the jury in a fair and balanced manner.  She did not refer to the evidence
    for or against the positions of either the plaintiffs or the defence.  She
    had reviewed her proposed charge to the jury with counsel prior to delivering
    those instructions.  Counsel did not take any exception to the manner in
    which she proposed to deal with the positions of the parties or the evidence.  In
    particular, there was no suggestion that a more detailed review of the evidence
    was necessary.  There was also no objection taken to the charge after it
    was delivered.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    had reviewed the evidence in the course of their addresses to the jury.  The
    relevant evidence was straightforward, brief and not difficult to understand
    or recall.  In these circumstances, we see no reversible error in the trial
    judge’s failure to review the relevant evidence.  We are confident that the
    jury was fully aware of the evidence when it made its determination.</p>
  <h2>(ii)  The alleged misdirection in telling the jury that no adverse inference
    should be drawn from the defence failure to call a witness.</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    issue arises out of the following circumstances.  The defence had indicated
    at the outset of the trial that it intended to call a person named “Kyle” who
    had been in the elevator.  The defence ultimately did not call Kyle.  Defence
    counsel explained that it had come to his attention that Kyle knew two of
    the jurors and had talked to at least one juror during the trial.  Consequently,
    the defence determined that it would not call Kyle.  The trial judge, after
    consultation with counsel, instructed the jury that in these circumstances,
    no adverse inference should be drawn against either side for the failure
    to call Kyle as a witness.  In effect, the trial judge made it clear to the
    jury that they should decide the case based on the evidence they heard.  In
    our view, this was an appropriate instruction in these circumstances.</p>
  <h2>(iii)  Did the trial judge misdirect the jury on the burden of proof?</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>During
    her instructions, on more than one occasion, the trial judge gave the jury
    a full, accurate and specific instruction on the burden and standard of proof.  In
    the course of instructing the jury on the significance of compliance or non-compliance
    with applicable governmental standards to the issue of negligence, the trial
    judge said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=left style='text-align:left'>Where governing
    legislation stipulates a specific standard of care to be followed and the
    defendant complies with that government standard, the plaintiffs bear a heavy
    onus to prove negligence by the defendant who has complied with the standard.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Based
    on other authorities brought to our attention, this appears to be a commonly
    used instruction.  It is clearly intended to assist the jury in understanding
    the evidentiary significance on the question of negligence of evidence that
    a party did or did not comply with applicable governmental standards.  Used
    in this way, the instruction is proper.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    would be better and more to the point of the instruction were this instruction
    made without any reference to the term “heavy onus”.  We agree with counsel’s
    submission that this phrasing does pose some risk of a suggestion of a higher
    burden of proof than the applicable balance of probabilities standard.  However,
    having reviewed the trial judge’s instructions in their entirety, we are
    satisfied that this risk did not arise in this case.  We would not give effect
    to this ground of appeal but do suggest that the term “heavy onus” should
    be avoided in future instructions.</p>
  <h2>(iv)  Did the trial judge err in refusing to allow the plaintiffs’ expert
    to testify regarding applicable maintenance standards?</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    has taken us through the relevant parts of the transcript.  We see no error
    in the trial judge’s decision.  The trial judge did not preclude the plaintiffs’ expert
    from testifying about the adequacy of Nor-West Elevator Co. Ltd.’s response
    to either the prior incident or this incident.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for the appellants candidly acknowledged that on the ruling as it was ultimately
    made, it was open to counsel at trial to elicit the evidence that had in
    fact provoked the objection.    </p>
  <h2>Disposition</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    dismiss the appeal from the findings against the appellants on the issue
    of liability.  Consequently, we do not reach the damages issues raised by
    the appellants.  The appeal is dismissed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
