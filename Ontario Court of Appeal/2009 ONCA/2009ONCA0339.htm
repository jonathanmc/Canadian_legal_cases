  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>OVERVIEW</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant, an
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario law firm, and the respondent, a client who was the estate trustee
    and sole beneficiary of his mother’s estate, entered into a fee agreement
    that contained a “success fee” respecting litigation over the estate.  The “success
    fee” is a contingency fee, which the parties agreed would be 10 per cent
    of the value of the assets of the estate.  They also agreed that disputes
    in relation to the contingency fee would be resolved by arbitration. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    dispute arose as to which of two dates should be used to value the assets
    for the purpose of applying the contingency fee.  The appellant served a
    notice of arbitration.  The respondent brought an application in the Superior
    Court to strike it out on the basis that the agreement to arbitrate was unenforceable
    for reasons of public policy.  The application judge agreed and struck out
    the notice of arbitration.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the application judge erred in assuming jurisdiction
    to determine whether the dispute was arbitrable.  It submits that the application
    judge should have deferred jurisdiction to the arbitrator.  In the alternative,
    the appellant submits that an agreement to arbitrate a contingency fee dispute
    between a solicitor and a client is valid and that the agreement with the
    respondent should be enforced.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent’s position is that an agreement to arbitrate a contingency fee
    dispute is an agreement to contract out of the client protection provisions
    of the <i>Solicitors Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. S.15.  Accordingly, he submits
    that the agreement to arbitrate is unenforceable for reasons of public policy
    and asks this court to uphold the application judge’s order striking the
    notice to arbitrate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    appeal raises two issues.  The first is whether the application judge erred
    by determining the enforceability of the arbitration clause contained in
    the contingency fee agreement, instead of leaving this determination for
    the arbitrator.  The second is whether she erred in holding that an agreement
    to arbitrate a contingency fee dispute is prohibited and cannot be enforced
    on account of public policy.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    relation to the first issue, I would hold that the application judge did
    not err in assuming jurisdiction to decide the enforceability of the arbitration
    clause in the contingency fee agreement.  I acknowledge that, as a general
    rule, the enforceability of an arbitration clause should be decided by the
    arbitrator.  However, in <i>Dell Computer Corp v. Union des consommateurs</i>,<i> </i>[2007]
    2 S.C.R. 801 (“<i>Dell</i>”), at paras. 84-85, the Supreme Court of Canada
    recognized that exceptionally a Superior Court judge can assume jurisdiction
    over the threshold issue of enforceability when an important question of
    law is raised and only cursory reference to the evidence is necessary.  The
    Supreme Court added a proviso that the issue must not be raised for purposes
    of delay: para. 86. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two
    important questions of law arise in this case which do not require extensive
    reference to the evidence.  The first is whether an arbitrator, as opposed
    to a judge, can decide a contingency fee dispute.  The second is whether
    the parties can contract out of the statutory protection giving a client
    the right to an assessment of whether the contingency fee is fair and reasonable.  No
    suggestion of delaying tactics arises on this record.  While the application
    judge did not turn her mind to the requirements in <i>Dell</i>, I would hold
    that, having regard to them, the prerequisites for her to assume jurisdiction
    at first instance were met in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    decided that the application judge correctly assumed jurisdiction, I must
    decide whether she correctly determined the questions of law.  The application
    judge was of the opinion that enforcing the arbitration agreement would result
    in the respondent losing the statutory protections of the <i>Solicitors Act</i>.  There
    are two rights in ss. 23 and 24 of the <i>Solicitors Act</i>.  One is the
    right to have a Superior Court judge decide a contingency fee dispute.  By
    their agreement the parties chose to have an arbitrator as opposed to a judge
    resolve any disputes.  In <i>Dell, </i>at para. 160, the Supreme Court held
    that the right to arbitration is a substantive right and that the parties’ choice
    should be respected.  I would apply <i>Dell.</i>  The second right contained
    in ss. 23 and 24 is the right to an assessment of whether the contingency
    fee is fair and reasonable.  The arbitration agreement is silent as to the
    powers of the arbitrator.  If this right was lost, the arbitrator’s decision
    would not be a decision on the merits and the fairness of the result would
    be compromised.  Both the broad public policy favouring the resolution of
    disputes on the merits and the public policy underlying the remedies given
    to a client in the <i>Solicitors Act </i>militate against this result.  I
    would hold that a party cannot contract out of his or her right to have an
    independent assessment of whether the contingency fee is fair and reasonable
    by an independent assessor.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    I would hold that the application judge erred in concluding that a solicitor
    and his or her client could not agree to have an arbitrator, as opposed to
    a Superior Court judge, hear a contingency fee dispute.  However, apart from
    the decision maker, I would agree with her that public policy prevents the
    parties from contracting out of the statutory protections contained in the <i>Solicitors
    Act</i> and any arbitration must be conducted in accordance with them. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>   For
    ease of reference the relevant provisions of the <i>Solicitors Act </i>are
    attached as Appendix A to these reasons.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>FACTS</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the application judge noted, the facts are not in dispute. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent Peter Wong’s parents died in 1999.  The respondent is the executor
    of his mother’s estate and its sole beneficiary.  His parents had significant
    assets in various jurisdictions including
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">China</st1:country-region>
    ,
    <st1:City w:st="on">

    and

    Ontario. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Litigation
    over the assets arose in several jurisdictions.  In
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario, a dispute arose concerning entitlement to an account held jointly
    by the respondent’s parents at the Royal Bank of
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto.  The respondent retained David Wires and Karen Jolley – at that
    time members of another firm – to make a claim to the funds.  Before the
    litigation was resolved, Wires and Jolley left to form a new firm, the appellant
    Wires Jolley LLP.  The respondent transferred the file to Wires Jolley.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    March 2004, Mr. Wires informed the respondent that he was exploring the possibility
    of a global mediation of all issues involving the respondent’s parents’ estates.  It
    was thought that the mediation would be preferable to litigation to resolve
    the various conflicts of laws issues arising in each jurisdiction.  In May
    2004, the parties agreed to a mediation to be conducted in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Hong Kong.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    the preparation for the mediation, the parties discussed a contingency fee
    arrangement.  The parties agreed on a fee arrangement in late August 2004
    under which the appellant would receive a fee of 10 per cent of the value
    of the respondent’s inheritance after deducting certain liabilities and expenses
    in the event that the mediation was successful. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    mediation was successful.  On September 12, 2005, almost a year after the
    minutes of settlement were signed, the appellant sent a letter to the respondent
    setting out two options.  Under Option 1, the appellant would assess its
    accounts before the court using the original retainer agreement.  The assessment
    was to be based on the value of the services.  The letter restated the appellant’s
    policy “to charge fees which are fair and reasonable” set out in earlier
    correspondence and then went on to list the factors that the appellant considered
    relevant to such an assessment in accordance with the case law. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Option
    2 proposed a fee of $212,547.27 and a success fee “as discussed and recorded
    in earlier correspondence” of 10 per cent of the net value of the assets
    the respondent received or was entitled to receive from the estate.  There
    is no issue that the success fee is a contingency fee agreement within the
    meaning of the <i>Solicitors Act</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Option
    2 also contained a number of other stipulations including the following arbitration
    clause:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Disputes arising from or in relation to the success
    fee will be resolved by arbitration in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto with a single arbitrator from ADR Chambers.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    receiving the benefit of independent legal advice, the respondent chose Option
    2.  He concedes that at the time of entering into the fee agreement, he embraced
    the idea of keeping the matter private. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    July 2007, Mr. Wires met with the respondent in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Vancouver to discuss the administration of the estate.  Mr. Wires suggested
    that 10 per cent of the current value of the assets equalled a success fee
    of $2,000,000.  The respondent did not accede to this suggestion as he was
    of the opinion that the contingency fee should be calculated based on the
    value of the estate as of January 1999.  Based on the January 1999 valuation
    date, he estimated the contingency fee was approximately $461,115.92.
     The relationship then became strained. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant rendered an account to the Estate of Tung Jean and Peter Wong based
    on the July 2007 valuation date and claimed a success fee of over $2,000,000.  It
    also served the respondent with a notice of arbitration pursuant to the <i>International
    Commercial Arbitration Act, </i>R.S.O. 1990, c. I.9 (the “<i>ICAA</i>”<i>)</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent replied with an application to the Superior Court to strike the
    notice on the ground that it was an attempt to oust the Superior Court’s
    jurisdiction under ss. 23 and 24 of the <i>Solicitors Act</i>, which provide
    that a fee agreement will be enforced by the Superior Court if the court
    is of the opinion that the agreement is fair and reasonable.  If not, the
    agreement will be declared to be void.  The respondent also contended that
    the account submitted by the appellant was not due and owing because he had
    not received distribution of all the estate assets. </p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>…the court also has jurisdiction to determine whether
    an agreement between a solicitor and client, or a term thereof, is enforceable.  The
    parties are now before the court and there is no practical or theoretical
    purpose served in deferring the argument to the arbitrator (para. 26).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge accepted that private commercial disputes can be left to
    private arbitration, but she was of the view that “[t]he relationship between
    members of the legal profession and the members of the public that they serve
    however, is one which transcends a mere commercial transaction” (para. 28).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge held that the arbitration clause was inconsistent with
    clients’ rights under the <i>Solicitors Act</i> to have contingency fee agreements
    assessed by a court to determine whether they are fair and reasonable.  In
    her view, “an agreement to arbitrate is in effect an agreement by the client
    to relinquish his recourse to the court and ought not to be enforced” (para.
    31).  The application judge held that a client’s right to have judicial supervision
    over a fee agreement with his or her lawyer is supported by reasons of public
    policy.  At paras. 28-30, she held:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The relationship between members of the legal profession
    and the members of the public that they serve… is one which transcends a
    mere commercial transaction.  The profession has a monopoly over the provision
    of legal services and the occasions upon which lawyers interact with members
    of the public occur often when the latter are in the most vulnerable of circumstances.  There
    is therefore an overarching public interest to be served in the court's supervision
    of the profession's monopoly.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>One may be entirely confident that the chosen arbitrator
    in this case … would act judicially and skillfully in deciding the issues
    between the parties.  There is, however, a residual institutional duty imposed
    on the court to have regard to the public interest and the broader ramifications
    of the decision it is to make that is not owed by a private arbitrator resolving
    a dispute privately…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Because of the profession's monopoly and the imbalance
    in bargaining power that so often works in the solicitor's favour, it is
    in the public interest that the court retain a supervisory role to ensure
    that fee agreements are fair and reasonable and it is for that purpose that
    the <i>Solicitors Act</i> confers access to the court and establishes a mechanism
    or protocol for the determination of the reasonableness of a solicitor's
    fees...</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'>ANALYSIS</h4>
  <h3>1.         In what forum should the question of the enforceability of the
    arbitration agreement have been decided at first instance? </h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that, based on the provisions governing international arbitrations,
    the Superior Court judge was obliged to stay the respondent’s application
    and refer the question of whether the arbitration agreement should be enforced
    to the arbitrator.  In order to appreciate the appellant’s argument, I must
    make brief reference to some of the relevant statutory provisions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    2(1) of the <i>Arbitration Act </i>states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This Act applies to an arbitration conducted under
    an arbitration agreement unless,</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a) the application of this Act is excluded
    by law; or </p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(b) the [<i>ICAA</i>] applies to the arbitration.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I have indicated, the appellant has chosen to proceed under the <i>ICAA</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    8 of the <i>ICAA</i> provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Where, pursuant to article 8 of the Model Law,
    a court refers the parties to arbitration, the proceedings of the court are
    stayed with respect to the matters to which the arbitration relates.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Article
    8(1) of the <i>UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration</i>,
    U.N. Doc. A/40/17 (1985), Annex I<i> </i>(the “<i>Model Law</i>”<i>,</i> attached
    as a schedule to the <i>ICAA</i>)<i>,</i> allows a court to refuse to enforce
    an agreement to arbitrate where the court finds that the agreement is “null
    and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed.”  Article 8(1) states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A court before which an action is brought in a
    matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement shall, if a party
    so requests not later than when submitting his first statement on the substance
    of the dispute, refer the parties to arbitration unless it finds that the
    agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that article 8(1) of the <i>Model Law</i> does not confer
    jurisdiction on the Superior Court to determine the enforceability of the
    arbitration clause in this case.  According to the appellant, this provision
    is limited to situations where an “action”<i> </i>has been brought to determine
    whether the arbitration agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable
    of being enforced before the arbitrator has made such a determination.  An
    application, the appellant submits, is not an action.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also submits that article 8(1) must be read with article 16 in
    mind.  Article 16 gives the arbitral tribunal competence to rule on its jurisdiction, “including
    any objections with respect to the existence or validity of the arbitration
    agreement”, either as a preliminary question or in an award on the merits.  If
    the tribunal rules on a preliminary question that it has jurisdiction, any
    party may request the court to decide the matter within 30 days of the ruling
    and there is no appeal from the court’s decision: article 16(3).  Article
    5 of the <i>Model Law</i> also states that court intervention in arbitral
    proceedings is limited to circumstances expressly provided for by the <i>ICAA.</i>  When
    this article is applied, the appellant submits that the Superior Court judge
    ought to have declined jurisdiction.</p>
  <h3>(i)        Does Article 8(1) of the <i>Model Law </i>apply only to an action?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    23 of the <i>Solicitors Act</i> specifies that an application is to be brought
    to determine the validity of a contingency fee agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    urging me to hold that the <i>Model Law</i> prevents a court from assessing
    whether this dispute is arbitrable because the application brought by the
    respondent is not an “action”
    within the meaning of Article 8(1) of the <i>Model Law</i>, the appellant
    is urging me to adopt a literal interpretation of the word “action”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not consider a literal interpretation to be appropriate for two related
    reasons.  The first is the statutory principle of interpretation known as
    harmonization.  Both the <i>Arbitration Act </i>and the <i>ICAA </i>deal
    with the same subject matter: arbitrations.  Statutory interpretation presumes
    a harmony, coherence, and consistency between legislation dealing with essentially
    the same subject matter: <i>R. v. Ulybel Enterprises Ltd., </i>[2001] 2 S.C.R.
    867, at para 52 and <i>Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership v. Rex</i>, [2002]
    2 S.C.R. 559, at para 27.  The language in article 8(1) of the <i>Model Law </i>can
    be compared with s. 7(2) of the <i>Arbitration Act </i>which provides that
    a court shall stay a “proceeding” in limited circumstances.  In
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario, a proceeding “means an action or an application”: see s. 1.03 of
    the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a> <i> </i>Applying this principle, the word “action” in
    article 8(1) should be read as including an application.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second reason is that statutes are to be interpreted having regard to their
    purpose and the context in which the words are used.  As I will explain below,
    the purpose of article 8(1) of the <i>Model Law</i> is to grant parties limited
    access to the courts to resolve jurisdictional disputes of a legal nature
    due to the court’s expertise compared with that of the arbitrator, the desire
    to avoid multiple legal disputes over the jurisdiction of an arbitral tribunal,
    and the interests of finality.  That purpose ought not to be undermined by
    an unduly literal interpretation of the proceeding used to initiate the court’s
    process.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    find support for both aspects of my position in the Supreme Court of Canada’s
    recent decision in <i>Dell</i>, a decision that considered article 940.1
    of the <i>Québec</i> <i>Code of Civil Procedure, </i>R.S.Q., c. C-25 (the “<i>Québec
    CCP</i>”<i>)</i> in light of article 8 of the <i>Model Act.</i>  Article
    940.1 of the <i>Québec CCP</i> provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Where an action is brought regarding a dispute
    in a matter on which the parties have an arbitration agreement, the court
    shall refer them to arbitration on the application of either of them unless
    the case has been inscribed on the roll <i>or it finds the agreement null</i>.
    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=ParaNO style='line-height:normal'>Deschamps J. recognized that the
    plain language of article 940.1, allowing courts to depart from the rule
    of systematic referral to arbitration when an agreement is “null” was more
    restrictive than that of article 8(1) of the <i>Model Law </i>which permits
    a court to refuse to refer an agreement to arbitration where the agreement
    is “null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She
    departed from a literal approach to Article 940.1, recognizing that the Civil
    Code had to be interpreted in light of the context in which it was enacted.  That
    context was the implementation of the <i>Convention on the Recognition and
    Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards</i>, 10 June 1958, 330 U.N.T.S. 3,
    and of its counterpart in the <i>Model Law</i>, article 8.  Having regard
    to the context and purpose of Article 940.1, she adopted a broader meaning
    of “null” so as to conform with the approach laid out in the <i>Model Law</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,
    the context requires me to depart from the literal meaning of the word “action” in
    article 8(1).  Applying the principle of harmonization and having regard
    to the purpose and context of the <i>Model Law</i>, I would interpret the
    word “action” as meaning the procedure used to invoke the court’s jurisdiction
    and, in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario, this would include an application. </p>
  <h3>(ii)      Irrespective of whether the issue is brought by way of an action
    or application, does the <i>Model Law</i> prevent a court from assuming jurisdiction
    to decide the arbitrability of a dispute?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Dell </i>is
    instructive on the issue of whether and when a court should assume jurisdiction
    to decide whether an arbitration clause is enforceable in the face of the <i>Model
    Law.</i>  To appreciate the context of the ruling, I will briefly summarize
    the facts of that case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dell,
    a well-known retail computer vendor, erroneously posted a sale price on its
    website for certain computer models.  The error was soon discovered, Dell
    corrected its mistake and announced it would not honour sales of computers
    at the erroneous, lower price.  Mr. Dumoulin, a Québec consumer, circumvented
    the measures taken by Dell to correct its mistake and was able to order a
    computer at the erroneous price.  Other consumers also ordered computers
    at the erroneous price.  When Dell refused to honour the sales, the Union
    des consommateurs (the “
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Union”) and Mr. Dumoulin filed a motion for authorization to institute a
    class action.  Dell applied for a referral of Mr. Dumoulin’s claim to arbitration
    pursuant to an arbitration clause contained in the terms and conditions of
    sale and dismissal of Mr. Dumoulin’s motion.  Dell argued that the arbitrator,
    rather than the court, had jurisdiction to determine whether the clause was
    enforceable.  The
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Union contended instead that it was proper for the court to determine the
    validity of the clause.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Writing
    for the majority<i>, </i>Deschamps J., reaffirmed the basic principles in
    favour of fostering the arbitration process set out in such cases as <i>Desputeaux  v. Éditions
    Chouette (1987) Inc., </i>[2003] 1 S.C.R. 178 (“<i>Desputeaux</i>”); <i>GreCon
    Dimter inc. v. J.R. Normand inc.</i>, [2005] 2 S.C.R. 401; and <i>Bisaillion
    v. Concordia University</i>, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 666.  She recognized, at para.
    3, that “[t]he independence and territorial neutrality of arbitration are
    characteristics that must be promoted and preserved in order to foster the
    development of this institution.”
     Later, at paras. 51-52, she remarked that arbitration is “a creature that
    owes its existence to the will of the parties alone”, and that, generally
    speaking, parties are free to choose “any place, form and procedures they
    consider appropriate.”  She also noted that the provision of the <i>Québec
    CCP </i>that was in issue, article 940.1, incorporates the essence of Article
    8 of the <i>Model Law</i> and that its counterpart, article 943, incorporates
    article 16 of the <i>Model Law</i>, adopting the “competence-competence” principle:
    para.80. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The “competence-competence” principle
    is one of deference to the arbitrator and means that the arbitrator is competent
    to determine his or her own jurisdiction and competent to rule on objections
    to it.  In this regard, Deschamps J. observed at para. 75 of her reasons
    that: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Some authors argue that the competence-competence
    principle requires the court to limit itself to a <i>prima facie </i>analysis
    of the application and to refer the parties to arbitration unless the arbitration
    agreement is manifestly tainted by a defect rendering it invalid or inapplicable[.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Deschamps
    J. appears to have rejected this argument and adopted a somewhat broader
    interpretation of the <i>prima facie </i>principle in that she recognized
    two exceptions to it.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    reviewing the international and domestic arbitration law of Québec, Deschamps
    J. laid down a “general rule” that she said was faithful “to the <i>prima
    facie </i>analysis test that is increasingly gaining acceptance around the
    world” and consistent with the “competence-competence” principle: <i>Dell </i>at
    paras. 83 and 87.  The “general rule” is that “in any case involving an arbitration
    clause, a challenge to the arbitrator’s jurisdiction must be resolved first
    by the arbitrator”: <i>Dell </i>at para. 84. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Deschamps
    J. then recognized two limited exceptions to the “general rule” of “systematic
    referral” to the arbitrator within article 940.1 of the <i>Québec CCP</i>,<i> </i>which
    she held was analogous to article 8 of the <i>Model Law</i>.  Where the challenge
    to the arbitrator’s jurisdiction is based “solely on a question of law” or
    a question of “mixed law and fact” where the “questions of fact require only
    superficial consideration of the documentary evidence in the record” as opposed
    to “the production and review of factual evidence”, a court could depart
    from the general rule of systematic referral: <i>Dell</i> at paras. 84-85.  These
    exceptions, under which a court may rule first on questions of law relating
    to the arbitrator’s jurisdiction, recognize that a court can itself find
    that an agreement is null rather than referring this issue to arbitration: <i>Dell </i>at
    para. 87.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Deschamps
    J. explained the justification for the exception to the rule of systematic
    referral to the arbitrator respecting questions of law at para. 84:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A court should depart from the rule of systematic
    referral to arbitration only if the challenge to the arbitrator’s jurisdiction
    is based solely on a question of law.&nbsp; <i>This exception is justified
    by the courts’ expertise in resolving such questions, by the fact that the
    court is the forum to which the parties apply first when requesting referral
    and by the rule that an arbitrator’s decision regarding his or her jurisdiction
    can be reviewed by a court.&nbsp; It allows a legal argument relating to
    the arbitrator’s jurisdiction to be resolved once and for all, and also allows
    the parties to avoid duplication of a strictly legal debate</i>.&nbsp; In
    addition, the danger that a party will obstruct the process by manipulating
    procedural rules will be reduced, since the court must not, in ruling on
    the arbitrator’s jurisdiction, consider the facts leading to the application
    of the arbitration clause. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    are three reasons why <i>Dell </i>is of assistance in this case.  First,
    the policy considerations mentioned in the above passage are not unique to
    Québec, but apply equally in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario.  Courts should have concurrent jurisdiction to resolve questions
    of law (and, also, questions of mixed law and fact requiring only a superficial
    examination of the record) based on their comparative expertise in resolving
    such questions, the rule that an arbitrator’s decision can be reviewed by
    a court, the desirability of attaining finality and the avoidance of duplication
    of a legal debate.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span class=MsoFootnoteReference> </span>Second,
    the provision of the <i>Québec</i> <i>CCP</i> that was in issue in <i>Dell</i>,
    art. 940.1, incorporates the essence of Article 8 of the <i>Model Law</i>:
    see <i>Dell </i>at para. 80.  As I have indicated, Article 8 of the <i>Model
    Law</i> also forms part of the law of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario pursuant to the <i>ICAA</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    this court’s prior jurisprudence on Article 8 of the <i>Model Law</i> is
    consistent with the general rule set out in <i>Dell</i>.  At para. 82, Deschamps
    J. referred to <i>Dalimpex Ltd. v. Janicki</i> (2003), 64 O.R. (3d) 737 (C.A.)
    and <i>Gulf Canada Resources Ltd. v. Arochem International Ltd. </i>(1992),
    66 B.C.L.R. (2d) 113 (C.A.) with apparent approval in the context of a discussion
    concerning the appropriate degree of scrutiny by the courts in determining
    the enforceability of an arbitration clause.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    pause here to observe that the general rule in <i>Dell </i>was recently applied
    by this court in <i>Dancap Productions Inc. v. Key Brand Entertainment Inc.</i>,<i> </i>2009
    ONCA 135.  That case concerned an ordinary commercial agreement in which
    the motions judge ignored the deferential approach to arbitration mandated
    by prior
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario jurisprudence, as well as <i>Dell</i>.  Sharpe J.A. was of the opinion
    that <i>Dell </i>did not change this court’s prior jurisprudence to the effect
    that a court should grant a stay of any court proceedings where it is “arguable” that
    the dispute falls within the terms of the arbitration agreement: see paras
    32-35.  <i>Dancap </i>did not involve a pure question of law or mixed fact
    and law requiring only limited reference to the evidence.  Rather, as noted
    by Sharpe J.A. at para 40,
    “[t]he determination of the scope of the ARA [Additional Rights Agreement]
    and the arbitration clause will require a thorough review of the parties’ complex
    contractual discussions, understandings, expectations and arrangements, an
    inquiry that clearly calls for much more than a ‘superficial consideration
    of the documentary evidence in the record.’”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Finally,
    in <i>Dell, </i>Deschamps J. also held that, before deciding to assume jurisdiction,
    the court must be satisfied that resort to its process is not a “delaying
    tactic and that it will not unduly impair the conduct of the arbitration
    proceeding.”  Thus,
    “even when considering one of the exceptions, the court might decide that
    to allow the arbitrator to rule first on his or her competence would be best
    for the arbitration process”:<i> Dell </i>at para. 86.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    approach set out in <i>Dell</i> therefore requires me to answer three questions.  First,
    what is the nature of the challenge to the arbitrator’s jurisdiction: is
    it a question of law, fact or mixed law and fact?  Second, if the challenge
    raises a question of mixed law and fact, does it require a detailed factual
    inquiry or only a superficial review of the evidentiary record?  Third, is
    the party initiating the jurisdictional challenge doing so for the purpose
    of delaying the arbitration process? </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the central question in this case – the enforceability of the arbitration
    clause – falls squarely within the exception to systematic referral set out
    by Deschamps J. in <i>Dell</i>.  The question whether an agreement to arbitrate
    disputes over a contingency fee is unenforceable and void for reasons of
    public policy is very much a question of law. The nature of the question
    requires an examination and application of the text and judicial interpretation
    of the provisions of the <i>Solicitors Act</i> together with consideration
    of the jurisprudence favouring enforcement of arbitration clauses.<i> </i> </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the line between questions of law and questions of mixed law and fact is
    not always clear, an appropriate litmus test was set out by the Supreme Court
    of Canada in <span class=title><i>Pushpanathan v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship
    and Immigration)</i></span>, <span class=reportcite>[1998] 1 S.C.R. 982,

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Of course, it is not easy to say precisely where
    the line should be drawn; though in most cases it should be sufficiently
    clear whether the dispute is over a general proposition that might qualify
    as a principle of law or over a very particular set of circumstances that
    is not apt to be of much interest to judges and lawyers in the future.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether
    an agreement to arbitrate disputes over a contingency fee is enforceable
    is very much a question that is of interest to lawyers and judges.  Even
    assuming that the nature of the question is one of mixed law and fact, however,
    the resolution of the legal issue is not inextricably linked to a detailed
    consideration of the evidentiary record.  Brief consideration of undisputed
    facts is all that is necessary to resolve the questions at issue in this
    case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    for the third question in the <i>Dell </i>test, the appellant has in no way
    suggested that the respondent’s application was brought as a delaying tactic
    or so as to unduly impair an arbitration proceeding.  As the application
    judge observed, although the respondent initially embraced the idea of keeping
    the dispute over the fees private, he then changed his mind and sought to
    exercise his rights under the <i>Solicitors Act</i>.  The parties have proceeded
    throughout on the footing that, since then, he has sought to raise a <i>bona
    fide</i> issue concerning the enforceability of an agreement to arbitrate
    a dispute over a contingency fee.  In my view, the record simply does not
    support a conclusion that the respondent brought the application as a delaying
    tactic.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I would hold that the application judge properly declined to leave the issue
    of the enforceability of the arbitration clause to the arbitrator and I would
    not give effect to the first ground of appeal.</p>
  <h3>2.         Is the arbitration clause unenforceable or can a solicitor and
    his or her client enter into an agreement to arbitrate a dispute respecting
    a contingency fee?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    order to answer this question, I must first consider the relevant provisions
    of the <i>Solicitors Act</i>.  Section 16 of the <i>Solicitors Act</i> provides
    that a solicitor may make an agreement in writing with his or her client
    for the payment of services “either by a gross sum or by commission or percentage,
    or by salary or otherwise, and either at the same rate or at a greater or
    less rate than that at which he or she would otherwise be entitled to be
    remunerated.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    right to make an agreement is subject to the provisions of ss. 17-33.  The
    relevant portion of section 23 of the <i>Solicitors Act</i> provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>…. every question respecting the validity or effect
    of [a contingency fee agreement] may be examined and determined, and it may
    be enforced or set aside without action on the application of any person
    who is a party to the agreement … by the Superior Court of Justice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  Pursuant
    to s. 28.1(11)(a)<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a>, a client may apply to the Superior Court of Justice
    for an assessment of an account 30 days after a final account has been rendered
    or within one year of its payment.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> While
    the application judge acknowledged that the <i>Solicitors Act </i>does not
    contain an express prohibition against contracting out of its provisions,
    she held that a client has the right to have fee disputes resolved by a Superior
    Court judge. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant contends that existing jurisprudence stands for the proposition
    that whenever a statute is silent on the issue of arbitrability, the right
    to arbitration exists.  The application judge failed to give sufficient weight
    to the strong public policy fostering the effectiveness and integrity of
    the arbitration process by holding parties to their agreement.  The appellant
    says it should not be denied recourse to arbitration, especially in light
    of the application judge’s comment and the parties’ apparent agreement that
    the arbitrator would act “skillfully and judicially” in deciding the issues. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent counters that s. 23 of the <i>Solicitors Act</i> provides that <i>every</i> question
    regarding the validity or effect of a written retainer agreement may be determined
    on application to the Superior Court.  Moreover, contingency fee agreements
    are regulated under s. 28.1 of the <i>Solicitors Act,</i> which provides
    a comprehensive code for the assessment of contingency fees.  The Superior
    Court has the exclusive jurisdiction to resolve fee disputes between
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario solicitors and their clients.  The application judge correctly held
    that public policy does not permit contracting out of the protections of
    the <i>Solicitors Act </i>including who conducts the assessment.  While the
    first option that the appellant gave to the respondents for paying the appellant’s
    costs refers to an assessment of whether the fee is fair and reasonable,
    option two, containing the contingency fee and the agreement to arbitrate
    disputes, does not.  Nor does the clause specify that the law of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario is to apply.  Thus, the respondent fears that the arbitrator will
    not apply the statutory requirements of the <i>Solicitors Act</i> and decide
    whether the contingency fee is fair and reasonable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons outlined below, I am of the opinion that a balance must be struck
    between these competing policy interests and that the application judge erred
    because she did not do so.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    majority decision of Deschamps J. in <i>Dell </i>did not comment directly
    on the argument that if a statute is silent on the issue of the arbitrability
    of a dispute, then arbitration is permissible, even where the statute specifically
    provides for a judicial dispute resolution mechanism.  In dissent, Bastarache
    and Lebel JJ., at para 221, held that because the <i>Consumer Protection
    Act</i>, R.S.Q. c. P-40.1 (the “<i>Consumer Protection Act</i>”) and the <i>Civil
    Code</i> <i>of Québec, </i>S.Q. 1991, c. 64 (“<i>Civil Code</i>”) “are silent
    as to the arbitrability of a consumer dispute”, that silence “suggests its
    permissibility.”
     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    comment by the minority in <i>Dell</i> was based on the court’s unanimous
    decision in <i>Desputeaux</i>.  In that case,<i> </i>at para. 46, LeBel J.
    articulated the proposition that “[i]f Parliament had intended to exclude
    arbitration in copyright matters, it would have clearly done so”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Desputeaux</i> involved
    a dispute concerning the interpretation of licensing agreements relating
    to the copyright in a fictional character.  One of the artists sought to
    refer the matter to arbitration.  Section 37 of the <i>Copyright Act</i>,
    R.S.C. 1985, c. C-42<i> </i>provided that the Federal Court and provincial
    courts had concurrent jurisdiction to decide disputes.  Section 37 of Québec’s <i>Act
    respecting the professional status of artists in the visual arts, arts and
    crafts and literature, and their contracts with promoters</i>, R.S.Q., c.
    S-32.01<i> </i>recognized the validity of using arbitration to resolve disputes
    arising out of copyright matters.  The Supreme Court held that s. 37 of the
    federal <i>Copyright Act </i>was sufficiently general that it could be read
    to include arbitration procedures contemplated by the Québec statute.  Accordingly,
    the Court overturned the decision of the Québec Court of Appeal declaring
    the arbitrator’s award a nullity.  Lebel J. held, at para. 42, that the mere
    fact that the legislation in question<i> </i>identified the courts as having
    jurisdiction over a dispute<i> </i>did not mean that the statute should be
    interpreted as excluding arbitration.  The legislature was merely identifying
    the courts within the judicial system that would have jurisdiction to hear
    the dispute; it was not excluding arbitration over a particular subject matter.  Arbitration,
    although not part of a state’s judicial system, is still, in a broad sense,
    part of a legitimate dispute resolution system that has been fully recognized
    by legislative authorities: see <i>Desputeaux </i>at para. 40. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Given
    the strong policy of deference afforded to arbitration agreements, and following
    the line of reasoning in <i>Desputeaux, </i>I would hold that, simply because
    the <i>Solicitors Act</i> refers to a Superior Court judge as having the
    jurisdiction to protect clients’ rights, this does not mean that disputes
    arising between a solicitor and a client may not be submitted to arbitration.  The
    Act simply identifies the person within the judicial system empowered to
    make a decision.  The right to have an independent decision maker who can
    interpret the agreement and make a decision respecting a contingency fee
    dispute is preserved through arbitration and hence the public policy of the
    Act, the provision of a forum for legitimate dispute resolution,<i> </i>is
    not undermined. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    analysis cannot, however, end here.  My review of the jurisprudence leads
    me to two important interrelated qualifications.  First, substantive statutory
    rights going to the merits of the dispute cannot be affected by the decision
    to enforce the arbitration clause.  Second, the jurisprudence concerning
    the <i>Solicitors Act </i>reflects a strong public policy limiting the parties’ freedom
    of contract that ought not to be ignored.  For the sake of completeness,
    this jurisprudence is discussed below.</p>
  <h3>            (a)       Substantive statutory rights not affected</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Automatic
      Systems Inc. v. Bracknell Corp. </i>(1994), 18 O.R. (3d) 257, Austin J.A.
      of this court granted a stay of a construction lien action pursuant to
      the <i>ICAA </i>in view of an agreement between the parties to arbitrate
      the quantum of a claim under the <i>Construction Lien Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990,
      c. C.30.   In so doing, Austin J.A. considered whether resort to arbitration
      would result in the loss of any right for the lien claimant: p. 263.  He
      concluded that apart from the adoption of a different procedure, no such
      right would be lost.  The decision of Austin J.A. was cited with approval
      by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Desputeaux</i>, at para. 46, albeit
      not on this point.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Dell, </i>both
    the majority and the dissenting opinions of the Supreme Court affirmed that
    the class action legislation in Québec was merely procedural and did not
    create new rights: see paras. 105 and 224.  As such, it could not oust Dell’s
    right to enforce the arbitration clause, a substantive right that was part
    of the terms and conditions of the sale of its computers.  A similar conclusion
    was reached in the companion case of <i>Rogers Wireless Inc. v. Muroff</i>,
    [2007] 2 S.C.R. 921.<a href="#_ftn3"

    in the jurisprudence cited above, the courts ensured that no substantive
    statutory rights affecting the merits of the dispute were lost when the arbitration
    agreement was enforced.  </p>

    properly address the public policy concerns at play in this case, some further

    24 provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Upon any such application, if it appears to the

    fit, but, if the terms of the agreement are deemed by the court not to be
    fair and reasonable, the agreement may be declared void, and the court may
    order it to be cancelled and may direct the costs, fees, charges and disbursements
    incurred or chargeable in respect of the matters included therein to be assessed

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge held, and I would agree, that public policy considerations
    animate the right to an assessment of the fairness and reasonableness of
    the terms of a contingency fee agreement.  In <i>Raphael Partners v. Lam </i>(2002),
    61 O.R. (3d) 417 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), Cronk J.A. discussed the criteria of fairness and reasonableness in the
    context of the review of a contingency fee agreement, stating at para. 37: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>When a fee agreement is challenged under the Act,
    the solicitor bears the onus of satisfying the court that the way in which
    the agreement was obtained was fair and that the terms of the agreement are
    reasonable.  The fairness requirement of s. 24 of the Act is concerned with
    the circumstances surrounding the making of the agreement and whether the
    client fully understands and appreciates the nature of the agreement that
    he or she executed. [Citations omitted.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She
    continued at para. 50:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The factors relevant to an evaluation of the reasonableness
    of fees charged by a solicitor are well established.  They include the time
    expended by the solicitor, the legal complexity of the matter at issue, the
    results achieved and the risk assumed by the solicitor.  The latter factor
    includes the risk of non-payment where there is a real risk of an adverse
    finding on liability in the client’s case. [Citations omitted.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    case law supports the respondent’s position that a client cannot contract
    out of the protections in the <i>Solicitors Act </i>for reasons of public
    policy.  For example, this court has held that an agreement to raise any
    disputes concerning accounts within 15 days as opposed to the 30 days provided
    for under the Act was held to be unenforceable: <i>Javornich v. McCarthy </i>(2007),
    225 O.A.C. 201.  Similarly, in<i> Andrew Feldstein &amp; Associates Professional
    Corp. v. Keramidopulos, </i>[2007] O.J. No. 3683 (S.C.), Murray J. held at
    para. 60 that “[t]o permit contracting out of the provisions of the<i> Solicitors
    Act </i>would defeat the whole purpose of those legislative provisions enacted
    in the public interest and designed to allow a client protection against
    unwarranted or unreasonable legal fees.”  Also, in <i>Plazavest Financial
    Corp. v. National Bank of Canada </i>(2000), 47 O.R. (3d) 641 (
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), at para. 14, Doherty J.A. quoted a passage from the judgment of Adams
    J. in <i>Borden &amp; Elliott v. Barclays Bank of Canada </i>(1993), 15 O.R.
    (3d) 352 (Gen. Div.), at pp. 357-58, to the effect that the legal profession’s
    monopoly status, coupled with the obligations on the profession in the <i>Solicitors
    Act</i>, make it clear that the rendering of legal services is not simply
    a matter of contract.  He rejected the submission that an agreement between
    a client and a lawyer could preclude the client from resorting to the <i>Solicitors
    Act</i> or the inherent power of the court to conduct an assessment of the
    lawyer’s fees. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    unlike in the present case, none of these decisions concern an agreement
    to choose a different forum in which to resolve the dispute, namely, arbitration.  Thus,
    there was no competing public policy to consider other than that contained
    in the <i>Solicitors Act. </i> </p>
  <h3><span>(c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Conclusion

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> I
    would hold that the application judge erred in concluding that a solicitor
    and his or her client could not agree to have an arbitrator, as opposed to
    a Superior Court judge, hear a contingency fee dispute.  However, the two
    qualifications to the arbitrability of contingency fee disputes examined
    above lead me to the conclusion that public policy prevents the parties from
    contracting out of the statutory protections contained in the <i>Solicitors
    Act</i>, and that any arbitration must be conducted in accordance with them.  While
    the parties are free to select a different decision maker than the one contemplated
    in the <i>Solicitors Act</i>, any decision maker appointed to hear the dispute
    make his decision in accordance with the substantive statutory rights contained
    in the <i>Solicitors Act</i>.  There are two reasons for my conclusion.  First,
    the jurisprudence that I have reviewed regarding the enforcement of arbitration
    clauses has not considered or sanctioned the removal of any substantive statutory
    right affecting the merits of the underlying dispute.  Second, the jurisprudence
    in relation to the <i>Solicitors Act </i>holds that it would be contrary
    to the public interest to allow solicitors and their clients to contract
    out of any statutory remedy in relation to the assessment of solicitors’ accounts.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    jurisprudence is illustrative of broader principles at work.  One of the
    overarching principles that the law recognizes, albeit subject to the value
    of finality, is the right to have a dispute decided on the merits.  No doubt
    it is for that reason that the jurisprudence respecting enforcement of arbitration
    clauses considers whether enforcing the arbitration agreement will affect
    the merits of the dispute.  In addition, freedom of contract, the value recognized
    in the strong policy enforcing arbitration agreements, is tempered here by
    the jurisprudence removing the client’s freedom to contract out of the remedies
    contained in the <i>Solicitors Act </i>on account of public policy. </p>

    have considered the reasons of Weiler J.A. but would conclude that the application
    judge should have declined to entertain the application to strike the notice
    of arbitration and, instead, should have referred the parties to the arbitrator.  If
    a question of law and public policy arises before the arbitrator, and if
    the arbitrator deals with the issue incorrectly, the respondent can seek
    to set aside the award. </p>

    reach this different result because I would attach greater force than does
    Weiler J.A. to certain passages in <i>Dell</i> and, in particular, the guidelines
    laid down to determine when a court may intervene in the arbitration process
    before its completion. </p>

    basis upon which the application judge decided to deal with the application
    was clearly inadequate. She recognized that the arbitrator could decide the
    question, but observed “the court also has jurisdiction to determine whether
    an agreement between a solicitor and client, or a term thereof, is enforceable.”  The
    reason she gave for the court exercising that jurisdiction was that “[t]he
    parties are now before the court and there is no practical or theoretical
    purpose served in deferring the agreement to the arbitrator.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Had
    the application judge asked the right questions, namely, whether the respondent
    was engaging in delaying tactics and whether deciding the question raised
    on the application would promote the arbitration process, she would not have
    come to this conclusion.  The text, case law and the Analytical Commentary
    to the Model Law all endorse a deferential approach to the question of the
    arbitrability of disputes under the Model Law.  Thus, if and when they arise,
    jurisdictional challenges to the ability of the arbitrator should generally
    be raised after the arbitrator has rendered a decision through an application
    to set aside the arbitral award.  This approach both fosters the arbitration
    process and prevents delaying tactics.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    first turn to the text of the Model Law. Both the arbitration tribunal and
    the court have jurisdiction to determine an arbitrator’s jurisdiction.  Article
    16(1) of the Model Law gives the arbitral tribunal the power “to rule on
    its own jurisdiction, including any objections with respect to the existence
    of validity of the arbitration agreement.”  Article 8 is not worded as a
    grant of jurisdiction to the court, but as a limitation of when the court
    will exercise the jurisdiction it otherwise possesses.  It provides that
    when a matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement is brought
    before the court, the court
    “shall... refer the parties to arbitration” except in the limited circumstances
    that “it finds that the agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable
    of being performed”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    pivotal question is what kind of review should the court engage in before
    deciding whether the agreement is “null and void, inoperative or incapable
    of being performed”?  In <i>Dell</i>, Deschamps J. indicated there are two
    opposing schools of thought in the debate over the degree of judicial scrutiny
    of an arbitrator’s jurisdiction under an arbitration agreement.  She referred
    to these as the interventionist and the prima facie approaches. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    the interventionist and the <i>prima facie</i> approaches seek to promote
    efficiency and economy in dispute resolution but do so from different perspectives.  The
    interventionist model is based on the concern that costly proceedings can
    be avoided by the court deciding the matter at the outset, rather than waiting
    to review the decision made by the arbitrator regarding his or her jurisdiction.  The
    interventionist model will tend to be more efficient and economical in those
    cases in which the court finds that the arbitrator was without jurisdiction.  However,
    where the court finds the arbitrator has jurisdiction, the arbitration proceedings
    will have been delayed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>prima
      facie</i> approach also seeks to save the parties the time, cost and effort
      of litigating the existence and validity of the arbitration agreement in
      duplicative proceedings.  However, this approach is primarily concerned
      with preventing delaying tactics and protecting the arbitration process
      from obstruction.  Proponents of the <i>prima facie</i> approach argue
      that routine or “systematic” referral to arbitration leads to the ultimate
      resolution of disputes and best prevents attempts to delay the arbitral
      process through early challenges to the arbitrator’s jurisdiction. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    deferential <i>prima facie</i> approach, based on the “competence-competence” principle,
    is more apparent in the Model Law that expressly recognizes the competence-competence
    principle in art. 16. Article 16 provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The arbitral tribunal may rule on its own jurisdiction,
    including any objections with respect to the existence or validity of the
    arbitration agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    noted Deschamps J. in <i>Dell</i>, under the <i>prima facie</i> test, a court
    should “limit itself to a <i>prima facie</i> analysis of the application
    and... refer the parties to arbitration unless the arbitration agreement
    is manifestly tainted by a defect rendering it invalid or an applicable”.  Deschamps
    J. sets out one articulation of the <i>prima facie</i> test at para. 76: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[TRANSLATION] The nullity of an arbitration agreement
    will be manifest if it is incontestable... . As soon as a serious debate
    arises about the validity of the arbitration agreement, only the arbitrator
    can validly conduct the review... . An apparently valid arbitration clause
    will never be considered to be manifestly null.</p>

    case law of this court supports a deferential or <i>prima facie</i> approach
    to the question of arbitrability.  In <i>Dell</i>,<i> </i>Deschamps J. cited
    this court’s decision in <i>Dalimpex Ltd. v. Janicki</i> (2003), 228 D.L.R.
    (4th) 179 (Ont.

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario not only to the validity but also the applicability of an arbitration
    clause.  In <i>Dalimpex</i>, Charron J.A. adopted the following test articulated
    by the British Columbia Court of Appeal in <i>Gulf Canada Resources Ltd.
    v. Arochem International Ltd.</i> (1992), 43 C.P.R. (3d) 390, 66 B.C.L.R.
    (2d) 113 (C.A.):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Considering s. 8(1) in relation to the provisions
    of s. 16 and the jurisdiction conferred on the arbitral tribunal, in my opinion,
    it is not for the court on an application for a stay of proceedings to reach
    any final determination as to the scope of the arbitration agreement or whether
    a particular party to the legal proceedings is a party to the arbitration
    agreement, because those are matters within the jurisdiction of the arbitral
    tribunal.  <i>Only where it is clear that the dispute is outside the terms
    of the arbitration agreement</i>, or that a party is not a party to the arbitration
    agreement, or that the application is out of time should the court reach
    any final determination in respect of such matters on an application for
    a stay of proceedings.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>Where it is arguable that the dispute falls
      within the terms of the arbitration agreement</i> or where it is arguable
      that a party to the legal proceedings is a party to the arbitration agreement
      then, in my view, the stay should be granted and those matters left to
      be determined by the arbitral tribunal. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    Weiler J.A. points out, in a recent decision, Sharpe J.A. suggested that <i>Dell</i> did
    not change this court’s prior jurisprudence regarding the deferential approach
    to arbitrability.  In <i>Dancap</i> <i>Productions Inc. v. Key Brand Entertainment
    Inc.</i>, 2009 ONCA 135, Sharpe J.A. indicated that the Supreme Court endorsed
    the “competence-competence” principle in <i>Dell</i>.  He applied that principle
    as articulated by Charron J.A. in <i>Dalimpex</i>, calling for
    “a deferential approach” allowing the arbitrator to decide whether the dispute
    is arbitrable, absent a clear case to the contrary. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Reference
    to the Analytical Commentary provides further support for the deferential <i>prima
    facie</i> approach and useful background for interpreting Deschamps J.’s
    statements regarding dilatory tactics and the integrity of the arbitral process
    in <i>Dell</i>. Section 13 of the <i>International Commercial Arbitration
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.9, of which the Model Law is a Schedule, provides
    that when interpreting the Model Law, recourse may be had to:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) the Report of the United Nations Commission
    on International Trade Law on the work of its eighteenth session (June 3-21,
    1985); and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b) the Analytical Commentary contained in the
    Report of the Secretary General to the eighteenth session of the United Nations
    Commission on International Trade Law,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>as published in The Canada Gazette, Part I, Vol.
    120, No. 40, October 4, 1986, Supplement. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Analytical Commentary discusses art. 16(3) of the Model Law and contrasts
    it with an earlier draft version which would have provided for concurrent
    court control.  Article 16(3) provides that, where the arbitral tribunal
    has ruled that it has jurisdiction, that ruling may be contested only in
    an action for setting aside the arbitral award after it has been rendered.  As
    the Analytical Commentary explains,
    “judicial control may be sought only after the award on the merits is rendered,
    namely in setting aside proceedings... [or perhaps] in any recognition or
    enforcement proceedings)”.  By contrast, draft art. 17(1) provided: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(Notwithstanding the provisions of article 16,)
    a party may (at any time) request the Court specified in article 6 to decide
    whether a valid arbitration agreement exists and (, if arbitral proceedings
    have commenced,) whether the arbitral tribunal has jurisdiction (with regard
    to the dispute referred to it).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    draft art. 17(1) would have allowed a party to request the court to determine
    the arbitral tribunal’s jurisdiction at any time, even while the arbitral
    proceedings have commenced.  The Analytical Commentary explains that the
    draft art. 17 was deleted from the text of the Model Law and Art. 16(3) was
    added.  The change was made “for the purpose of preventing dilatory tactics
    and abuse of any immediate right to appeal”.  The Analytical Commentary explains
    that this solution was chosen even though its disadvantage </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>as was pointed out by the proponents of immediate
    court control, is that it may lead to considerable waste of time and money
    where, after lengthy proceedings with extensive hearings and taking of evidence,
    but the Court sets aside the award for lack of jurisdiction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    can be inferred from the Analytical Commentary then, that the Model Law is
    tilted strongly against tactics that may obstruct and delay arbitration proceedings.  The
    policy of the Model Law is less concerned with individual instances in which
    applications to find the arbitration clause invalid may be well-founded.  The
    scheme of the Model Law is designed to enhance the efficiency of the arbitration
    process by deferring judicial control to the setting aside of arbitration
    awards after they have been rendered.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is against this context that Deschamps J.’s judgment in <i>Dell</i> must
    be understood. Deschamps J. made clear that the court’s ability to decide
    the matter with only a superficial consideration of the record was a necessary
    but not a sufficient condition for assuming jurisdiction. She then stated,
    at para. 86:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Before departing from the general rule of referral,
    the court must be satisfied that the challenge to the arbitrator’s jurisdiction
    is not a delaying tactic and that it will not unduly impair the conduct of
    the arbitration proceeding. This means that <i>even when considering one
    of the exceptions, the court might decide that to allow the arbitrator to
    rule first on his or her competence would be best for the arbitration process</i>.
    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    she did not refer to <i>Dell</i>, I am prepared to assume that the application
    judge entertained the application to strike the arbitration notice because
    she thought she could determine it on a superficial consideration of the
    record.  As well, I accept that in this case only a superficial consideration
    of the record is necessary to pose the public policy question asserted.  The
    application judge, however, showed no appreciation for the additional requirements
    that the court must be satisfied that the application is not a delaying tactic
    and that an immediate court decision as to the arbitrator’s jurisdiction
    would be best for the arbitration process.  Had the application judge asked
    herself these questions, I am satisfied that she would not have departed
    from the rule of systematic referral to arbitration set out in <i>Dell</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent made no effort to satisfy the application judge that his application
    was not a delaying tactic.  I recognize that the appellant did not argue
    before the application judge that the respondent was engaging in delaying
    tactics.  However, given Deschamps J.’s unequivocal statement in <i>Dell</i> that
    the court
    “must be satisfied” the challenge is not a delaying tactic the application
    judge was required to turn her mind to that issue.  Given the design of the
    Model Law to avoid delays in the arbitration process and to generally reserve
    court intervention to the review of the arbitral award, the application judge
    was required to consider what would be best for the arbitration process. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,
    the respondent, after receiving independent legal advice, entered into a
    contract to arbitrate any fee disputes about his agreement with the appellant.  He
    is liable to the appellants for their legal services, whether the assets
    of the estate are valued on the date he would choose or on the day the appellants
    would choose.  His application has resulted in the delay of the arbitration
    process to determine the amount owing to the appellants.  Until the arbitration
    and court proceedings are concluded, the respondent will not be compelled
    to make any payment in respect of the services performed by the appellant.  He
    did not, as he might have, support his application for court intervention
    with proof that he had paid the lower undisputed amount. I make no finding
    that the respondent was seeking to delay.  My point is that the respondent
    in applying for the court’s intervention did not file any evidence on which
    the court could be satisfied his application was not a tactic to delay.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    more significant point though, is that the application judge erred in failing
    to find that referral to arbitration would be best for the arbitration process.  At
    this stage, the issue of public policy raised by the respondent is hypothetical
    and may or may not become an issue.  Whether the issue arises at all depends
    on the decision of the arbitrator as to the applicable valuation date for
    the estate assets and liabilities of the estate.  If the arbitrator accepts
    the valuation date asserted by the respondent, or if the arbitrator chooses
    the valuation date asserted by the appellants but reduces the fee to an amount
    the respondent accepts as fair and reasonable, the question raised before
    the application judge will not arise.  In my view, allowing an application
    judge to entertain an application attacking arbitration every time there
    is an issue of public policy might possibly arise would “unduly impair the
    arbitration process” and would certainly not be “best for the arbitration
    process”: <i>Dell</i> at para. 86.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, when the matter first came before the application judge it was
    at least arguable that the matter was arbitrable.  Weiler J.A.’s analysis
    confirms that is the case.  If the judge had applied the <i>Dalimpex</i> standard
    she would have referred the parties to the arbitrator.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    question as to the fairness and reasonableness of the fee may not arise before
    the arbitrator.  If it does arise, if the arbitrator addresses it, and if
    the arbitrator decides it incorrectly, the court can pronounce on matters
    of public policy in reviewing the arbitrator’s award.  On a review, the court
    would have the findings of the arbitrator regarding the nature and complexity
    of services provided, any risks taken in the retainer, the qualifications
    of the lawyers, their usual rates, the hours worked and any other information
    that would be relevant to deciding if the final fee was fair and reasonable.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[112]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is worth identifying provisions of the Model Law that allow the court to
    set aside an arbitration award as incompatible with the State’s public policy.  Article
    34 of the Model Law deals with setting aside an arbitral award after it has
    been made.  An arbitral award may be set aside under art. 34(2)(a)(i) if
    the agreement is not valid under the applicable law, under art. 34(2)(b)(i)
    if the subject-matter of the dispute is not capable of settlement by arbitration
    under the law “of this State”, and under art. 34(2)(b)(ii) if “the award
    or any decision contained therein is in conflict with the public policy of
    this State”.  Moreover, art. 36(1)(b) of the Model Law allows a court to
    refuse to recognize or enforce an arbitral award if it finds that i) the
    subject matter of the dispute is not capable of settlement by arbitration
    under the law of this State, or ii) the recognition or enforcement of the
    award would be contrary to the public policy of this State. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[113]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    conclusion, if judicial control on the basis of public policy is necessary,
    that control should be exercised on review of the arbitration award.  The
    Model Law, as explained by the Analytical Commentary and as interpreted by
    the Supreme Court in <i>Dell</i> and the jurisprudence of this court, makes
    clear that the general rule is systematic referral to the parties to arbitration.  In
    this case, there was no justification for a departure from that rule. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[114]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Therefore,
    I would hold that the application judge should have refused to entertain
    the application and should have referred the parties to the arbitrator.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    add that I agree with the Weiler J.A. that the respondent was properly before
    the court.  It is no moment that article 8 (1) of the Model Law refers to
    an “action”
    brought before the court, whereas in this case the respondent brought an “application”.  The
    Model Law is an international instrument that was not drafted with an eye
    on the Ontario Rules of Civil Procedure.  In explaining art. 8, the Analytical
    Commentary refers to when “a party starts litigation”.  The word “action” in
    article 8 is to be interpreted in that sense.</p>

    in the case of contingency fee agreements.  Section 28.1(10) provides that
    ss. 17-19 - which require an assessment officer to determine whether a fee
    agreement for business done in court is fair and reasonable, and permit the
    officer to solicit the opinion of a court and have that court remedy the
    situation if the agreement is not fair and reasonable - do not apply to contingency
    fee agreements.  That section, however, must be read in conjunction with
    s. 28.1(11).  Thus, ss. 28.1(10) and (11) were designed to ensure that judges
    of the Superior Court, rather than assessment officers, are given the authority
    to review contingency fee agreements according to the standards of fairness
    and reasonableness: see Mark Orkin, <i>The Law of Costs, </i>2d ed. (Aurora:
    Canada Law Book, 2008), at para. 308.1(3), and The Joint Committee on Contingency
    Fees (
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario), <i>Report on Contingency Fees </i>(Report presented to the Attorney
    General for
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario), September 2000), at pp. 41-42.  Assessment officers cannot interpret
    agreements.</p>

    further held that legislation amending the <i>Consumer Protection Act </i>and
    prohibiting agreements obliging a consumer to arbitrate a dispute or preventing
    them from bringing a class action, unless entered into after the dispute
    arose, was prospective only and of no application.</p>
