    appellant, Minh Thoan Ha, was convicted of possession of MDMA (Ecstasy) for
    the purpose of trafficking and of production of MDMA, contrary to ss. 5(3)(b)
    and 7(2)(c), respectively, of the <i>Controlled Drugs and Substances Act</i>,
    S.C. 1996, c. 19 (the “<i>CDSA</i>”).  Most of the evidence relating to these
    offences was obtained through four covert searches conducted by the Ottawa
    Police Service (the “O.P.S.”) of a small commercial office space and a rental
    storage facility at which the appellant had been observed while under police
    surveillance and investigation.  The searches were carried out under the
    authority of a warrant issued by Fraser J. of the Ontario Court of Justice
    pursuant to s. 487.01 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> (the “<i>Code</i>”).  Warrants
    issued under that section are sometimes described as “general” warrants to
    distinguish them from the traditional search and seizure warrants issued
    under s. 487.  I will refer to this warrant as a general warrant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the appellant’s trial, the central issues were whether the general search
    warrant was valid under s. 8 of the <i>Charter </i>and whether the evidence
    obtained pursuant thereto should be excluded under s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.  The
    trial judge, Power J. of the Superior Court of Justice, upheld the validity
    of the general search warrant, admitted the evidence obtained pursuant thereto,
    and convicted the appellant of the two offences with which he was charged.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    appeal, the appellant challenges the trial judge’s rulings.  Accordingly,
    the appeal raises issues relating, generally, to the interpretation of s.
    487.01 of the <i>Code</i> and, specifically, to the validity of the general
    search warrant issued in this case.</p>

    course of these surveillance efforts, the police found that the appellant,
    generally using one of several aliases, would make cash purchases for large
    quantities of chemicals used in the production of MDMA, the principal ingredient
    in Ecstasy tablets.  In addition, the police observed the appellant drive
    to locations in

    Toronto and
    <st1:place

    <st1:City w:st="on">

    December 2, 4, and 5, the appellant was observed spending time inside unit
    33.  On the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup>, the police noticed significant
    frost due to condensation on the windows of unit 33.  Windows of the neighbouring
    units, however, were not frosted.</p>

    December 13, 2002, Fraser J. of the Ontario Court of Justice issued a general
    search warrant with respect to both the commercial office space and the rental
    storage units on
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Canotek Road.  The warrant was valid for 59 days, from December 14, 2002
    to February 10, 2003, and authorized the police to covertly enter and search
    the various units identified therein.  Following a covert entry and search,
    the police were authorized to engage in a wide range of activities, including
    removing, photographing, videotaping and copying documents, taking samples
    of chemicals and suspected controlled substances, fingerprinting any items
    found in the premises, and seizing any items found in a garbage or recycling
    container within the premises.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    police entered the premises under the authority of the general warrant on
    four occasions over a 17-day period.  Their findings on each of these occasions
    are summarized below:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) December 18<sup>th</sup>, 2002 – In unit 33,
    police found a large amount of equipment and a wide variety of chemicals
    which could be used in an ecstasy production laboratory.  A Health Canada
    analyst concluded that a chemical production had been undertaken within unit
    33 at some point in the past, but was not active at the time and had not
    been recently active.  In unit 16, police found additional equipment and
    glassware which could be used in an ecstasy production lab.  The police found
    a box with the handwritten name “Minh Ha”.  The police did not make a comprehensive
    list of the chemicals and items in these units as they did not want to spend
    much time inside the units on this day.  However, samples of some of the
    chemicals were taken by the police.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b) December 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2002 – In unit 33,
    police found that there had been significant activity since the search on
    December 18<sup>th</sup>.  An area had been sealed off with a heavy polytarp.  A
    line of tables had been set up.  Hot plates were on these tables.  There
    appeared to be a new ventilation system attached to the ceiling.  There were
    bottles of chemicals throughout the unit.  On December 24<sup>th</sup>, 2002
    an analyst from Health Canada reviewed a video-tape taken by the police on
    December 23<sup>rd</sup>, 2002, and concluded that the appellant was setting
    up a lab and was still at the “precooking” stage, possibly preparing to produce
    MDA or MDMA.  Police also entered unit 24, but found it empty.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(c) December 27<sup>th</sup>, 2002 – Police observed
    that no major changes had been made within unit 33 since the search on December
    23<sup>rd</sup>.  Work had been done on a ventilation system, but it was
    not complete.  Police found a black garbage bag containing aluminum shavings,
    which are used in the process of making MDMA.  Samples were taken of substances
    found within the unit.  As a result of the search of unit 33 on December
    27<sup>th</sup>, 2002, an analyst from Health
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    prepared a report, dated January 2<sup>nd</sup>, 2003, which concluded that
    it was reasonable to infer that a synthesis of MDMA and/or MDA was being
    planned.  The analyst also noted that since the entry on December 18<sup>th</sup>,
    2002, a laboratory work area had been constructed in the unit.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(d) January 3<sup>rd</sup>, 2003 – In unit 33,
    police found an operating venting system.  No chemical reactions were occurring.  Police
    also found four metal trays containing white and grey powder.  Samples of
    the substances were taken from each tray.  On January 4<sup>th</sup>, 2003
    an analyst from Health
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    determined that three of these samples contained MDMA and that one sample
    probably contained MDMA (but analysis was not yet complete).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    January 4, 2003, the appellant was arrested.  A search of the van he was
    driving at the time of his arrest revealed 4,485 ecstasy pills and over $7,000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    January 5, 2003, the O.P.S. obtained a telewarrant under s. 487.1 of the <i>Code</i> to
    search the appellant’s residence in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Ottawa, a house he shared with his brother and parents.  A search of the
    appellant’s room led to the seizure of the following items: invoices for
    the purchase of chemicals from chemical supply companies; books and Internet
    references pertaining to the production of ecstasy; a dye for a pill press;
    and, a lease agreement for unit 33 in the name of Khoi Vu, the appellant’s

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    are significant differences between the investigative powers described in
    s.&nbsp;487 and those set out in s. 487.01.  Unlike s. 487, s. 487.01 is
    not limited to searches of “a building, receptacle or place”.  There are
    no spatial limitations on s. 487.01. Nor is it limited to any particular
    investigative technique or procedure.  Apart from a prohibition against interference
    with the bodily integrity of a person (s. 487.01(2)), there are no express
    limits on the investigative methods that may be authorized. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    487.01 fundamentally alters the traditional search warrant paradigm.  Instead
    of legislation permitting judicial authorization of a specific investigative
    method (search and seizure) where certain statutory conditions are met, s.
    487.01 speaks to any situation in which the police seek judicial authority
    to do something that, absent that authority, would constitute a breach of
    s. 8 of the <i>Charter</i>.  Section 487.01 ensures that the determination
    of whether the police will be allowed to use a specific investigative means
    (not involving interference with bodily integrity) in any given case will
    be decided by balancing the state interest in law enforcement and the individual
    interest in privacy.  The state will not be denied access to investigative
    methods that are constitutionally justified because the relevant statute
    does not contemplate the specific investigative means that the police seek
    to use.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    487.01 recognizes that Parliament cannot anticipate or imagine all investigative
    means or techniques that are or will become available to the police.  Section
    487.01 focuses not on authorizing specific techniques, at least where there
    is no interference with bodily integrity, but rather on whether the public
    interest in authorizing the specific investigative technique in issue is
    sufficiently strong in the circumstances to overcome an individual’s constitutional
    right not to be subject to an unreasonable search or seizure. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite
    the many differences between the traditional search warrant power in s.&nbsp;487
    and the general warrant power in s. 487.01, their essential structures are
    the same.  Both require that the police obtain judicial authorization based
    on sworn evidence before engaging in investigative procedures that interfere
    with an individual’s s. 8 rights.  Both sections set out statutory prerequisites
    that must be satisfied before the authorization can be issued.  Broadly speaking,
    those prerequisites are used to determine when the public interest in the
    investigation of crime is sufficiently strong to supersede an individual’s
    s.&nbsp;8 rights.  While the criteria are not identical, they serve the same
    purpose.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant does not challenge the constitutionality of s. 487.01.  In approaching
    the appellant’s arguments, one must proceed from the premise that s. 487.01
    draws a constitutionally acceptable balance between state powers and individual
    rights.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor
    does the appellant contest that the trial judge applied the proper test for
    reviewing the general search warrant issued by Fraser J., namely, whether
    there was some evidence, as amplified on the review, that might reasonably
    be believed on the basis of which the authorization could have been granted:

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='

    which requires that there be “no other provision” in the <i>Code</i> or any

    “would provide for a warrant, authorization or order permitting the technique,

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge erred in holding that s. 487.01 of
    the <i>Code </i>can authorize repeated covert entries and searches of private
    property.  According to the appellant, such entries and searches are not
    a “device or investigative technique or procedure” under s. 487.01(1) of
    the <i>Code</i>.  Accordingly, a general search warrant under s. 487.01(1)
    cannot authorize them.  The appellant asserts that s. 487.01 was introduced
    as part of a legislative scheme to address deficiencies in the search warrant
    system vis-à-vis police use of electronic devices to record and intercept
    communications.  Specifically, it was devised to address the use of various “devices”, “techniques”,
    and “procedures” that were being utilized by the police, but were not authorized
    under the traditional search power in s. 487 of the <i>Code</i>.  According
    to the appellant, repeated covert entries and searches fall outside the scope
    of this legislative purpose and description.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    several reasons, I do not accept this submission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    and most importantly, the plain meaning of the words of 487.01(1) does not
    support the interpretation advanced by the appellant.  The words “investigative
    technique”, “procedure”, and “do any thing described in the warrant” easily
    encompass police entries and searches.  Indeed, the verbal linkage between “entry” and “search” on
    the one hand, and “investigative technique” and “procedure” on the other
    hand, is, in my view, both obvious and overwhelming.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    s. 487.01(5.1) specifically recognizes that a general warrant issued under
    subsection (1) can authorize a peace officer “to enter and search a place
    covertly”.  It is therefore difficult to see why a court should implicitly
    subtract from one subsection the very words that are explicitly set out in
    another subsection.  Indeed, it is obvious that <br>
    s. 487.01(5.1) would make no sense if a general warrant issued under subsection
    (1) could not be used to authorize covert entries and searches.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    the case law case does not support the appellant’s submission.  In <i>R.
    v. Noseworthy</i> (1997), 33 O.R. (3d) 641, at p. 644, this court specifically
    declined to accept the interpretation that the words “do any thing” in s.
    487.01(1) ought to be read <i>ejusdem generis</i> with the preceding words
    “any device or investigative technique or procedure”.  Similarly, in <i>R.
    v. Lauda</i> (1998), 37 O.R. (3d) 513, aff’d [1998] 2 S.C.R. 683, this court,
    at pp. 522 – 523, referred to the remedial character of s. 487.01 and confirmed
    that it “provides a flexible range of investigative procedures, ranging from
    various forms of surveillance to the search and seizure of tangible objects.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth,
    the legislative history giving rise to the enactment of s. 487.01 in 1993
    does not support the appellant’s submission that Parliament was concerned
    only with electronic devices to record and intercept communications.  Indeed,
    as stated by Scott Hutchison in his book, <i>Hutchison’s Canadian Search
    Warrant Manual 2005</i> (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto: Thomson Carswell, 2005), at p. 143:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Through s. 487.01 (and s. 487.02), Parliament has
    provided <i>a broad, plenary warrant-granting power</i> intended to ensure
    that judicial authorization is legally available <i>for virtually any investigative
    technique</i> that can be brought within the <i>Hunter</i> conditions for
    judicial pre-authorization. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fifth,
    I see no policy reason for struggling to constrain the scope of s. 487.01
    by adding words that were not expressly included by Parliament in the provision.  In <i>CanadianOxy
    Chemicals Ltd. v.
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    (Attorney General)</i>, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 743, at paras. 20 and 21, Major J.
    said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A primary, though not exclusive, purpose of the <i>Criminal
      Code</i>, and penal statutes in general, is to promote a safe, peaceful
      and honest society.  This is achieved by providing guidelines prohibiting
      unacceptable conduct, and providing for the just prosecution and punishment
      of those who transgress these norms.  The prompt and comprehensive investigation
      of potential offences is essential to fulfilling that purpose.  The point
      of the investigative phase is to gather all the relevant evidence in order
      to allow a responsible and informed decision to be made as to whether charges
      should be laid.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>At the investigative stage the authorities are
    charged with determining the following: What happened?  Who did it?  Is the
    conduct criminally culpable behaviour?  <i>Search warrants are a staple investigative
    tool for answering those questions, and the section authorizing their issuance
    must be interpreted in that light</i>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>In this passage, the Supreme
    Court of Canada was considering the interpretation of search warrants under
    s. 487 of the <i>Code</i>, assuming that the state has established all of
    the pre-conditions to the issuance of the search warrant and that those pre-conditions
    pass constitutional muster.  In my view, the court’s reasoning is equally
    applicable to the interpretation of general search warrants under s. 487.01.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, I conclude that a covert entry and search falls squarely within
    the meaning of an “investigative technique or procedure”
    under s. 487.01 of the <i>Code</i>.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>“<u>No other provision” – s.

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant contends that the trial judge erred in this case in not holding
    that the issuance of the general search warrant violated s. 487.01(c) of
    the <i>Code</i>, which restricts the issuance of a general warrant to situations
    in which “there is no other provision” in the <i>Code</i> or any other federal
    statute that “would provide for a warrant, authorization or order permitting
    the technique, procedure or device” sought by the police.  According to the
    appellant, a search warrant could have been issued in this case under either
    s. 487 of the <i>Code</i> or s. 11 of the <i>CDSA</i>, thus precluding the
    issuance of a general warrant under <br>
    s. 487.01 of the <i>Code</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    support of this submission, the appellant relies on the holding of Parrett
    J. of the British Columbia Supreme Court in <i>R. v. Mero</i> (2003), 109
    C.R.R. (2d) 34, at para. 18, that “[t]he availability of a warrant under
    s. 11(1) of the <i>Controlled Drug and Substances Act</i> would preclude
    the issuance of a warrant under s. 487.01 by operation of <br>
    s. 487.01(1)(c).”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not accept this submission.  The simple fact is that there is no provision
    in the <i>Code</i>, the <i>CDSA</i>, or in any other federal statute that
    would authorize an unlimited number of covert entries and searches on private
    property over a two-month period.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    Frankel J.A. addressed this issue in <i>R. v. Brand</i> (2008), 229 C.C.C.
    (3d) 443 (B.C.C.A.), and rejected the above statement of Parrett J. in <i>Mero</i>,
    explaining at paras. 50 and 51 that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>…there is nothing in the language of s. 487.01(1)(c)
    that precludes a peace officer from obtaining a general warrant solely because
    he or she has sufficient information to obtain a search warrant.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>. . .</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>That the police are in a position to obtain a search
    warrant does not prevent them from continuing to investigate using all other
    lawful means at their disposal.  Having regard to the requirements of s.
    487.01(a), I expect that in many cases the information the police present
    in support of an application for a general warrant would also support an
    application for a search warrant.  I see nothing wrong in utilizing a general
    warrant to obtain information with a view to gathering additional and possibly
    better evidence than that which could be seized immediately through the execution
    of a search warrant.  In addition, I expect there will be some cases in which
    investigative action taken under a general warrant will result in an investigation,
    or an aspect of it, being abandoned; e.g., where a covert entry reveals that
    a property does not contain a marihuana grow operation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the analysis of Frankel J.A.  The focus in the s. 487.01(1)(c)
    analysis is not on whether there are other investigative techniques that
    might accomplish the purported investigative purposes or goals of the police;
    rather, the focus is on the particular investigative technique or procedure
    that the police seek to utilize and whether it can properly be authorized
    by another provision in the <i>Code</i> or any other federal statute.  In
    this case, the police sought to obtain authorization to conduct an unlimited
    number of covert entries and searches on private property over a two-month
    period.  Except for s. 487.01 of the <i>Code</i>, there is “no other provision
    in…any other Act of Parliament” that could potentially accomplish this goal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    hasten to add that this is not the end of the inquiry.  Although, s. 487.01(c)
    does not invite an assessment of whether or not the investigative technique
    or procedure sought to be utilized by the police should be authorized, the
    question of the merits of an authorization remains a live and important one.  However,
    this question falls to be determined under s. 487.01(1)(b) of the <i>Code</i>.  This
    leads to the appellant’s third and, in my view, crucial argument.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>“<u>The best interests of the

    appellant submits that the trial judge erred in this case in not holding
    that the general search warrant violated s. 487.01(1)(b) of the <i>Code</i>,
    which restricts the issuance of a general warrant to situations where “the
    judge is satisfied that it is in the best interests of the administration

    response to this submission must be anchored in the balancing exercise articulated
    by Dickson J. in <i>Hunter v. Southam</i>, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145, at pp. 159 – 160:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This limitation on the right guaranteed by s. 8,
    whether it is expressed negatively as freedom from “unreasonable” search
    and seizure, or positively as an entitlement to a “reasonable” expectation

    a particular situation the public’s interest in being left alone by government
    must give way to the government’s interest in intruding on the individual’s

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the general search warrant issued in this case tipped
    too far towards the law enforcement side of the scale.  Specifically, in
    support of this submission, the appellant contends that: the warrant was
    nothing more than a “fishing expedition”; it improperly authorized multiple
    entries of private property; the 59-day duration was too long; the warrant
    could not have advanced the investigation beyond what could have been achieved
    with a regular search warrant; and, there were insufficient conditions or
    safeguards set out in the warrant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not accept these submissions.  I will address them in order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the description of the general search warrant in this case as a mere “fishing
    expedition” is, in my view, a serious mischaracterization.  This label is
    belied by the appellant’s own submission that a regular search warrant could
    have been authorized (I note that, in my view, there is no type of warrant
    that should authorize an investigation that is truly a “fishing expedition”).  Moreover,
    the evidence obtained over a two-year period by the police in both
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Ottawa and
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto also pointed strongly towards a potential large prohibited drug laboratory
    in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Ottawa, as well as the appellant’s major role in relation thereto.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    it is true that the general search warrant issued in this case authorized
    multiple entries into the subject properties.  Indeed, the police entered
    and searched the premises identified in the warrant on four occasions over
    a 17-day period.  I see nothing wrong, however, with this component of the
    investigation.  A drug lab, especially a large one, takes time to assemble.  It
    is also a potentially dangerous place.  In this case, the lab was not in
    an isolated location; it was set up in a unit in an industrial strip mall
    in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Ottawa.  It is also worth noting that danger was a factor at one of the two
    storage units located across the street from the lab, as attested to in paragraph
    62 of the Agreed Statement of Facts, which indicated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Sulfuric Acid (very strong acid) and Sodium Hydroxide
    (very corrosive base) stored side by side.  Some of the bags of Sodium Hydroxide
    were leaking.  If they were mixed together an explosion would have occurred.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    the duration of the general search warrant – 59 days – was reasonable.  An
    authorization to intercept private conversations may be issued for up to
    60 days: see <br>
    s. 186(4)(e) of the <i>Code</i>.  In <i>Brand</i>, the authorization under
    s. 487.01 was not only operative for three months, but it was also extended
    for an additional six weeks by a second authorization.  Finally, in his testimony
    on the <i>voir dire</i>, Detective Nixon explained the necessity of the particular
    duration of the warrant in this case:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        Why was it necessary to have it open
    for sixty days, approximately?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        Well, again, with discussions with other
    officers involved in this, and discussions with Mr. Hugel [a senior chemist
    at Health
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    ], at the time Sergeant Doug Culver, these labs are not something that occur
    overnight; there is a time that is required to set up a lab.  Chemicals can
    be brought to a lab or one of the storage facilities and sit for a period
    of time then taken to the base, if you will, or the lab itself, and then,
    you know, the process can begin.  Labs are set up, materials are acquired.  The
    production stage commences.  And that, again, is not something that occurs
    over the period of one or two nights.  A formula has to be followed and it
    can take any amount of time.  I would say that it would never be less than
    four days for MDMA or MDA.  So that time period allowed us to monitor the
    progress of the lab.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>In my view, this is a reasonable
    explanation for what was a reasonable duration of the warrant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth,
    the fact that some of the purposes or goals of the police investigation could
    have been achieved by the issuance of a warrant under s. 487 of the <i>Code</i> does
    not preclude reliance on a general warrant issued under s. 487.01.  As stated
    by Frankel J.A. in <i>Brand</i> at para. 51, “I see nothing wrong in utilizing
    a general warrant to obtain information with a view to gathering additional
    and possibly better evidence than that which could be seized immediately
    through the execution of a search warrant.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, the general warrant issued under s. 487.01 in this case had the
    potential (I put it no higher) to enable the police to obtain different evidence
    from that which they possibly could have obtained under a traditional search
    warrant, namely, evidence relating to purposes (c) and (e) of the investigation
    purposes – to confirm the stage of production of the lab and the processes
    which are being followed and continue to monitor it (the record establishes
    that the potential lab might have been a very large one), and to identify
    the appellant’s accomplices (the record establishes that at least one other
    person was involved in the delivery of the chemicals to the premises), respectively.  These
    purposes could have foundered because the execution of a traditional search
    warrant would have terminated the investigation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fifth,
    the general search warrant did contain a number of conditions.  It provided
    that if, during the execution of the warrant, the safety of any person was
    compromised the police officers were required to identify themselves as peace
    officers.  The warrant also stipulated that if, during the search, assisting
    officials from Health
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    determined that any item posed a health or safety risk which necessitated
    the seizure of the item and/or the dismantling of the operation, the police
    were to seize the item and/or dismantle the operation.  Further, the warrant
    required police to dismantle the operation if, during the search, the supervising
    officer determined that “a fully operational production operation is producing
    what appears to be a controlled substance”.  Moreover, the warrant was confined
    to two commercial locations, not a private residence, and was limited in
    duration to 59 days.  Taken together, these conditions comply with this court’s
    observation in <i>R. v. Brooks</i> (2003), 178 C.C.C. (3d) 361, at para.
    28, that conditions attached to a warrant issued under s. 487.01 of the <i>Code</i> should
    be “explicit, clear and narrowly drawn”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    I emphasize that the crimes being investigated in this case were the production
    and distribution of, potentially, a huge amount (approximately one million
    pills) of a dangerous hard drug (Ecstasy) with a street value of $20,000,000.  Moreover,
    there is often a real problem of investigating so-called consensual crimes,
    including drug crimes.  As expressed by Lamer J. in <i>R. v. Mack</i>, [1988]
    2 S.C.R. 903 at 916:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If the struggle against crime is to be won, the
    ingenuity of criminals must be matched by that of the police; as crimes become
    more sophisticated so too must be the methods employed to detect their commission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, these are important contextual factors worthy of consideration with
    respect of the “best interests of the administration of justice” test in
    s. 487.01(1)(b) of the <i>Code</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, I conclude that the trial judge did not err in concluding
    that the issuance of the general search warrant was, in the circumstances
    of this case, in the best interests of the administration of justice.</p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>(d) <u>Conclusion</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    s. 487.01 of the <i>Code</i> can authorize a covert entry and search of private
    property.  In this case, the general search warrant complied with the conditions
    set out in both paragraphs (b) and (c) of s. 487.01(1) of the <i>Code.</i>  Accordingly,
    the trial judge correctly concluded that the issuance of the general search
    warrant did not violate the appellant’s rights under s. 8 of the <i>Charter.</i></p>
