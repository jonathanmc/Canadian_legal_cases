  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Acting
    on a tip from a confidential informant, the Guns and Gang Unit of the Toronto
    Police made a high-risk takedown of a motor vehicle thought to be driven
    by an individual armed with a weapon.  Mr. Williams was not that individual,
    but he was a passenger in the vehicle.  When he emerged from the vehicle,
    at the request of the police, he was carrying a loaded handgun in the waistband
    of his pants.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    handgun was a Krieghoff Suhl 9 millimetre Luger – a prohibited firearm.  It
    had ammunition in the magazine and in the chamber ready to fire, although
    the safety was on.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Williams was charged with eight counts relating to the unauthorized possession
    and storage of the handgun, but he was convicted on one count only – possession
    of a firearm without a licence or a registration certificate.  He was acquitted
    on the charge of possessing a loaded prohibited firearm.  The other charges
    were either dismissed or withdrawn at the request of the Crown.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the appeal, the Crown attacks only the acquittal for possession of a loaded
    prohibited firearm.  The issue is narrow: did the respondent have the necessary <i>mens
    rea</i> for that offence?  The respondent says he did not because he was
    unaware that the barrel was shorter than 105 millimetres, which is the demarcation
    point between a prohibited firearm and a restricted firearm under the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>.  He therefore did not know that the firearm was “prohibited.”  The
    Crown chose to particularize the offence by charging possession of a <i>prohibited</i> firearm,
    he says, and was accordingly required to prove that he had the requisite
    knowledge that the handgun was prohibited as opposed to restricted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge agreed.  I do not, and would allow the appeal for the reasons
    that follow.</p>

    84(1) of the <i>Code</i> defines a “prohibited firearm,” so far as is relevant
    for the appeal, as “a handgun that … has a barrel equal to or less than 105
    mm in length.”</p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal;'>Respondent’s Argument that he Lacked
        the Requisite <i>Mens Rea</i></span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is no dispute that the Krieghoff Suhl 9 millimetre Luger in question is a
    prohibited weapon.  Its barrel measures 102.07 millimetres.  The respondent
    admits the handgun in question is a prohibited weapon.  He admits it was
    found on his person.  He admits there was ammunition in the gun and that
    it was ready to be fired.  He admits that he did not have a licence or a
    registration certificate for the gun, or “any of that stuff.”  And he admits
    that he knew he was not allowed to “have any kind of gun, whether it was
    prohibited or restricted or legitimate”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent testified, however, that he had never measured the gun or made
    any enquiries about it, and had no reason to believe it was 102.07 millimetres
    in length.  He had had the handgun for about two weeks prior to his arrest.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is clear that the offence created by s. 95(1) of the <i>Code</i> is an offence
    requiring <i>mens rea</i>.  It is punishable by imprisonment – indeed, a
    mandatory minimum sentence in the case of indictment – and there is nothing
    in the section to indicate that no mental element is required:  see <i>R.
    v. Phillips</i> (1979), 44 C.C.C. (2d) 548 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ); <i>R. v. Archer</i>, (1984) 6 C.C.C. (3d) 129 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ); <i>R. v. Prue</i>, [1979] 2 S.C.R. 547.  <i>Phillips</i> and <i>Archer</i> concerned
    possession of a prohibited weapon – a knife that opened automatically by
    gravity or centrifugal force – under what was then s. 88(1) of the <i>Code</i> (now
    s. 91(2)), which provided that “every one who has in his possession a prohibited
    weapon” commits an offence.  With respect to the <i>mens rea</i> of that
    offence, Martin J.A. said this in <i>Archer</i>, at p. 132:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The <i>mens rea</i> required to constitute the
    offence under s. 88(1) consists in either knowledge or recklessness with
    respect to the characteristics of the knife in question which, in fact, make
    it a prohibited weapon.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From
    these authorities the respondent argues that he did not have knowledge of
    the characteristics of the handgun that make it a prohibited firearm, i.e.,
    that its barrel measured 105 millimetres or less.  He therefore lacked the
    requisite <i>mens rea</i>.</p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>The Respondent had the Requisite <i>Mens
          Rea</i> </span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the <i>mens rea </i>under s. 95(1) is satisfied where the offender
    knew that he or she was in possession of a loaded firearm.  Knowledge of
    the length of the handgun’s barrel is not part of the <i>mens rea</i> required
    for the offence created by s. 95(1), and consequently, the trial judge erred
    in acquitting the respondent on this count.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    95(1) makes it an offence to possess “a loaded prohibited firearm or restricted
    firearm …,”<a
href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a> unless the person possessing the firearm has a
    licence to do so and a registration certificate for the firearm.  There are
    not two offences – possession of a loaded prohibited firearm, and possession
    of a loaded restricted firearm.  Rather, there is only one offence: possession
    of a loaded firearm, whether prohibited or restricted.  This is made abundantly
    clear by the French version of the <i>Code</i> which uses the
    “either/or” structure in relation to the type of firearm:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=FR-CA>95(1)
    … commet une infraction quiconque a eu sa possession dans un lieu quelconque <i>soit</i> une
    arme à feu prohibée <i>ou</i> une arme à feu à autorisation restreinte chargées … [</span>Emphasis<span lang=FR-CA> added.]</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    the structure of the language creating the s. 95(1) offence is different
    than that of s. 91(2) creating the offence of possession of a “prohibited <i>weapon</i>”
    (emphasis added), which is the offence that was at issue in <i>Phillips</i> and <i>Archer</i>.  When
    those cases were decided, the predecessor of s. 91(2) provided that “every
    one who [had] in his possession a prohibited weapon” was guilty of an offence.  When
    the respondent was charged, s. 91(2) –
    the comparable provision – read:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[E]very person commits an offence who possesses
    a prohibited weapon, a restricted weapon, a prohibited device, other than
    a replica firearm, or any prohibited ammunition, unless the person is the
    holder of a licence under which the person may possess it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From
    the structure of s. 91(2) – using as it does the commas that s. 95(1) lacks – it
    is evident that the provision creates different offences: possession of a
    prohibited weapon; possession of a restricted weapon; possession of a prohibited
    device; possession of prohibited ammunition.  For purposes of the appeal,
    I need not determine what “knowledge … with respect to the characteristics” of
    the weapon or device – to use the language of <i>Archer</i> – may be necessary
    to bring the offender within one or another of the s. 91(2) offences.  Those
    offences are not in play here.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is clear that s. 95(1) creates only one offence, the gravamen of which is
    the possession of a loaded firearm<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[3]</span></span></span></a>.  It matters not whether the firearm is
    “prohibited” or “restricted.”  The offence is the same.  The potential penalties
    are the same under s. 95(2).  The <i>mens rea</i> required for conviction
    under s. 95(1), therefore, is simply knowledge by the offender that he or
    she is in possession of a firearm – in this case, a handgun – that is loaded.  Here,
    there is no doubt the respondent knew he was in possession of a loaded handgun.  It
    is therefore unnecessary to consider whether some other mental state – for
    example, wilful blindness – would be sufficient to establish “knowledge”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    interpretation is consistent with the language of the <i>Code</i> and with
    the purpose of the provision and the intent of Parliament.  The offence created
    by s. 95(1) is designed to protect the public from the danger posed by people
    with loaded firearms.  It is intended to catch <i>all</i> unauthorized loaded
    handguns.  A “prohibited firearm” – in the context of handguns – is defined
    in s. 84 as a handgun that has the characteristics set out therein.  A “restricted
    firearm” is defined in s. 84 (again, in the context of handguns) to mean “a
    handgun that is not a prohibited firearm”.  Consequently, a handgun is either
    a restricted or a prohibited firearm.  There are no other handguns under
    the <i>Code</i>.  That is why the language forbids the possession of “a loaded
    prohibited firearm <i>or</i> restricted firearm”
    (emphasis added).     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    adopt the respondent’s argument that the Crown must prove <i>mens rea</i> in
    relation to the type of weapon specified in the indictment would create an
    unwarranted hurdle for the Crown.  Accused persons could always assert that
    they had not measured or made any enquiries about the length of the handgun’s
    barrel.  Accordingly, regardless of the way in which the charge is framed,
    the Crown would rarely, if ever, be able to obtain a conviction.  Where the
    charge is possession of a loaded prohibited firearm, the argument will be
    that the accused person did not know that the length of the barrel was 105
    mm or less and therefore lacked the requisite <i>mens rea</i> that the gun
    was a prohibited firearm.  Where the charge is possession of a loaded restricted
    firearm, the same argument would be made with respect to the length over
    105 mm.  If the Crown charged possession of a loaded prohibited firearm or
    restricted firearm – adopting the exact language of the offence created – the
    accused will submit that the Crown must prove knowledge of one or the other,
    but he or she just did not know either!  To give effect to the language and
    purpose of s. 95(1), and to the intention of Parliament, it is only necessary
    to give to the <i>mens rea</i> component its common sense meaning: the requisite
    mental element will be established where the Crown proves that the accused
    was knowingly in possession of a loaded prohibited or restricted handgun
    that he or she was not legally entitled to possess.  Knowledge that the barrel
    of the handgun measures 105 millimetres, or more or less than that length – i.e.,
    of whether the handgun is “prohibited” or “restricted” – is immaterial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is some support for this approach to the <i>mens rea</i> component of the
    s. 95(1) offence in the jurisprudence arising from drug-related prosecutions.  In
    trafficking, importing or possession cases, it is not necessary for the Crown
    to demonstrate that the accused knew he or she possessed (or was importing
    or trafficking in) the very prescribed drug identified in the indictment
    provided the accused knew the drug was a narcotic – for example, the actual
    drug involved is cocaine whereas the accused believed it to be hashish, or

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[We] are all of the opinion that in these circumstances
    where the evidence is clear and consistent only with the conclusion that
    the accused knew the substance that he had in his possession was indeed a
    drug the possession of which was contrary to the statute, the fact that he
    mistakenly believed the drug to be hashish rather than opium is of no moment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Paraphrased
    in the context of the case at bar, it can be said that “the evidence is clear
    and consistent only with the conclusion that the accused knew [the loaded
    handgun] that he had in his possession was indeed [a loaded handgun] the
    possession of which was contrary to the statute”, and therefore that “the
    fact that he mistakenly believed the [handgun measured more or less than
    105 millimetres] is of no moment.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under
    the narcotics control regime, the offence in question forbids the possession
    of (or the importing of or trafficking in) a narcotic.  Which narcotic does
    not matter, as long as it is included in a forbidden schedule.  Similarly,
    under s. 95(1) of the <i>Code</i>, the offence is the possession of a loaded
    firearm.  Whether the firearm is prohibited or restricted does not matter.  The
    common denominator in the comparison between the two types of offences is
    that the <i>actus
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    reus</i> (possession of a forbidden item) and the <i>mens rea</i> (knowledge
    of the characteristics that make it a forbidden item) do not relate to different
    crimes but rather to the same crime in each case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is fundamental that where the <i>actus
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    reus</i> of a criminal offence is proved, there must also be proof of the <i>mens
    rea </i>of the <i>same crime</i>.  In his text, <i>Criminal Law</i>, 2d ed.
    (London: Stevens
    &amp; Sons Limited, 1961), at p. 129, Glanville Williams states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>What are different crimes for the purpose of the
    rule depends primarily upon the arrangement of the statute; each section
    presumptively creates a different crime or group of crimes.  It is possible
    for a single sentence of a section to create a number of different crimes ….  <i>If
    a section is thus held to create different crimes, it would not be possible
    to transfer the malice from one crime to another even within the same section</i>.
    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An
    example of a number of different crimes being created by a single sentence
    in a section of the <i>Code</i> is s. 91(2) discussed above.  For the reasons
    I have articulated above, however, the language of s. 95(1) creates only <i>one</i> offence:
    possession of a loaded firearm (prohibited or restricted).<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

'>[4]</span></span></span></a>  Since a handgun – the loaded firearm in this
    instance – must by definition be either a prohibited or a restricted firearm,
    convicting the respondent of the offence with which he was charged (possession
    of a loaded prohibited firearm) knowing that he was in possession of a loaded
    handgun, does not involve transferring to him an intention relevant to one
    crime in order to convict him of another.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    the foregoing, it is not necessary to deal with the Crown’s alternative argument
    based upon wilful blindness.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would therefore give effect to the Crown’s submission that the trial judge
    erred in holding that the respondent’s ignorance of the length of the barrel
    of the handgun in question negated the <i>mens rea</i> necessary for a conviction
    under s. 95(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  I would allow the appeal on
    that ground.</p>
  <h3 style='page-break-after:avoid'>Delay in Prosecuting the Appeal</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent argues that, if we conclude the trial judge erred and that the <i>mens
    rea</i> for the offence charged has been made out, we should quash the acquittal
    but order a stay of the proceedings on abuse of process grounds – applying
    ss. 7 and 24(1) of the <i>Charter</i> – because of the delay in prosecuting
    the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    there has been considerable delay cannot be gainsaid.  The Crown launched
    its appeal on January 19, 2005.  The transcripts –
    consisting of 1063 pages – were completed on November 8, 2005.  But the appeal
    was not perfected until September 23, 2008, almost three years after the
    transcripts were ready and almost three years after the respondent had finished
    serving his sentence on the charge on which he had been convicted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    length of the Crown’s delay here is, indeed, troubling.  Mr. Neander forthrightly
    and candidly accepts the blame, acknowledging that although there were some
    extenuating personal circumstances that impeded his progress in preparing
    the appeal, the delay is unjustifiable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Appellate
    delay is not captured by the guarantee to be tried within a reasonable time
    under s. 11(b) of the <i>Charter</i>.  However, extreme delay in perfecting
    a Crown appeal, and accompanying prejudice, may contravene fundamental notions
    of justice and engage the abuse of process protections of s. 7.  A stay of
    proceedings, nonetheless, is a rarely exercised remedy, and I am not persuaded
    that the delay in the circumstances of this case either constitutes a s.
    7 breach or, if it does, warrants such a remedy.  As was the case in <i>R.
    v. B. (L.)</i> (2007), 86 O.R. (3d) 730 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), where the Crown delay was 2 ½ years, the charges are serious, society
    has a strong interest in having the respondent tried (and, where properly
    found guilty, convicted), and there is no evidence of specific prejudice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    I would not grant a stay on grounds of delay, as indicated below, delay in
    prosecuting the appeal does have a bearing on sentence.</p>
  <h3>III.       DISPOSITION</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the end, I would allow the appeal on the <i>mens rea </i>ground, set aside
    the acquittal on count 1, and enter a conviction in its stead.  I agree with
    Ms. Maunder, as does the Crown, that in these circumstances the conviction
    on count 5 (possession of a firearm without a licence) should be stayed on <i>Kienapple</i> principles.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was sentenced to 9 months in custody in addition to 15 months credit
    for pre-trial custody on count 5 – the equivalent of 2 years’ imprisonment.  He
    has served his sentence.  Mr. Neander – partly in recognition of the delay
    issue, I believe – does not seek anything further in respect of sentence.  In
    the circumstances, then, I would simply impose a similar sentence on count
    1 and order that it run concurrently with the sentence imposed, and served,
    on count 5 which has now been stayed. </p>

    provisions also encompass possession of “an unloaded prohibited firearm or

    noted above, s. 95(1) creates two offences: possession of a <i>loaded</i> firearm,

    (together with readily accessible ammunition), whether prohibited or restricted.  The
    latter offence is not pertinent here, however.</p>
