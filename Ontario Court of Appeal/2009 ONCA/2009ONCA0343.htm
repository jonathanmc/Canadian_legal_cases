  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant, Dana Canada Corporation, appeals from the trial judgment awarding
    damages to the respondent in the amount of $241,643.83 for breach of contract.   The
    trial judge concluded that the respondent accepted the appellant’s offer
    of an early retirement severance package, which the appellant then refused
    to make available to him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that the appellant’s offer of early retirement was embodied
    in two documents: Structural Solutions Severance Plan for Management and
    Severance Plan for Management Structural Solutions Division, which he attached
    to his judgment.  He found that these documents made “a simple and straightforward
    and unconditional” offer to the respondent that was open to him to accept
    to result in a binding contract.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the trial judge erred in construing these documents.  The first
    document stated that “employees who are eligible for retirement should seek
    guidance and information about alternatives from the Human Resource’s Department”.  This
    alone indicated that this was no simple, straightforward and unconditional
    offer.  Rather, it showed that employees eligible for retirement should explore
    their alternatives with the Human Resources Department.  As the respondent
    was eligible for retirement and had indicated he planned to retire, there
    was no unconditional offer to him.  Whether he had given irrevocable notice
    of his retirement is beside the point.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    it is unnecessary to say more, we consider it plain and obvious that an objective
    reasonable person, in the position of the respondent and knowing what the
    respondent knew, could not have understood these documents to make an unconditional
    offer of early retirement for him to accept unilaterally.  He knew that the
    documents were created to enable him to explain to his subordinates the company’s
    program to achieve a 10% reduction of the Canadian workforce.  In-chief,
    he said that manpower reduction was the purpose of the whole program.  He
    knew he would be replaced because the appellant had started the process to
    replace him and he, in fact, had participated in that process.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge, while stating the correct test of objective contract formation
    at one point, in his reasons, focussed on the plaintiff’s subjective understanding.  The
    trial judge said “it was not unreasonable for the plaintiff to believe that
    upon Mr. Servos receiving the plaintiff’s acceptance there would be a binding
    agreement”.  If the trial judge had maintained as his focus what an objective
    reasonable person would believe, he would have concluded that there was no
    binding agreement. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal is allowed and the action is dismissed.  Costs are fixed in the amount
    of $12,500 inclusive of GST and disbursements.</p>
