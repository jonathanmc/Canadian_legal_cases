  <h2>I.          INTRODUCTION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    appeal raises the issue of whether a judgment creditor may enforce an order
    for costs by garnishment of a sum of money set aside for the purchase of
    a non-commutable life annuity for the benefit of the judgment debtor under
    the terms of a will.  The motion judge held that such a sum of money was
    available for garnishment.  One of the beneficiaries of the estate, Jesse
    Stevenson, appeals the order of the motion judge.  He also seeks leave to
    appeal the order of costs.</p>
  <h2>II.        THE FACTS</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Anna
    Penina Ker (the testatrix) of Niagara-on-the-Lake died on January 15, 2006.  Her
    last will and testament provided that the residue of her estate be divided
    into ten equal parts.  Five equal parts were to be dealt with as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Five (5) of such equal parts shall be used to purchase
    a non-commutable life annuity from an insurance company payable to my daughter,
    ANDREA HELEN STEVENSON, all matters in connection with this purchase to be
    in the discretion of my Trustees.  Upon the death of my said daughter, or
    upon my death if she has predeceased me, the parts, or the balance then remaining
    shall be used to purchase a non-commutable life annuity from an insurance
    company payable to my grandson, JESSE STEVENSON, all matters in connection
    with this purchase to be in the discretion of my Trustees[.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>One
    equal part was to be paid to the grandson of the testatrix, Jesse Stevenson,
    for his use absolutely.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>One
    equal part was to be set aside and used as an education fund for the benefit
    of a grandson of the testatrix, Luke DeRose.  Similarly, one equal part was
    to be set aside and used as an education fund for the benefit of another
    grandson of the testatrix, Harry DeRose. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span

    to the death of the testatrix, Kirsten Stevenson obtained an order of the
    Superior Court, dated December 13, 2007, in another proceeding involving
    the estate of her late father that required Andrea Stevenson to pay to Kirsten
    Stevenson the sum of $145,000 for the costs of that proceeding.</p>

    of the <i>Wages Act</i>.  The total amount of all your payments to the sheriff

    the time of the service of the notice of garnishment on the estate trustees,
    the purchase of the non-commutable life annuity for Andrea Stevenson provided
    for in the will had not yet been finalized.  </p>
  <h2>III.       THE MOTION FOR DIRECTIONS</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>By
    notice of motion dated February 11, 2008, the trustees moved for directions
    in the Superior Court in respect of the notice of garnishment as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>i.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>whether
    the capital of Andrea Stevenson’s share of the Estate of Anna Penina Ker
    can be encroached upon to pay the said Notice of Garnishment;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>ii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>whether
    Jesse Stevenson’s rights would be prejudiced should the capital of Andrea
    Stevenson’s share be encroached upon.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion for directions was heard in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    St. Catharines on April 10, 2008, by Ramsay J. of the Superior Court of Justice.  Andrea
    Stevenson did not appear on the motion for directions.  Her son, Jesse Stevenson,
    was represented by counsel.  Kirsten Stevenson was also represented by her
    own counsel.  Counsel for the Children’s Lawyer appeared in the interest
    of the underage beneficiaries.  Counsel for the trustees appeared but did
    not take a position on the motion.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    a brief oral decision, the motion judge determined that the capital available
    for the benefit of Andrea Stevenson held by the trustees had vested in Andrea
    Stevenson on the death of the testatrix and was available to satisfy the
    requirements of the notice of garnishment.  He further held that Jesse Stevenson’s
    rights would not be prejudiced by the trustees’ giving effect to the notice
    of garnishment.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge fixed the costs of the trustees at $1,500 and the costs of Kirsten
    Stevenson at $3,000 payable by Jesse Stevenson forthwith.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Jesse
    Stevenson appeals to this court in respect of the order for directions and
    seeks leave to appeal the costs award.  In this court, the only party to
    appear other than Jesse Stevenson was Kirsten Stevenson.  Neither Andrea
    Stevenson nor counsel for the trustees appeared.  No one has appeared for
    the underage beneficiaries.</p>
  <h2>IV.       GROUNDS OF APPEAL</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant raises the following grounds of appeal:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    motion judge erred in holding that the legacy vested in Andrea Stevenson
    on the death of the testatrix and was therefore subject to garnishment;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the

    to the golden rule of estate litigation;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    motion judge erred in failing to treat Andrea Stevenson’s share as having
    already been converted into a non-commutable annuity;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(iv)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    motion judge erred in failing to distinguish between a beneficiary’s right
    to demand payment of capital and the rights of third parties, such as judgment
    creditors, to make the same demand;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span style='"Times New Roman"'>(v)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    motion judge erred in finding that the encroach-ment on the capital of the
    share of Andrea Stevenson in favour of the judgment creditor was not prejudicial
    to the rights of the appellant.  </p>
  <h2>V.        ANALYSIS</h2>
  <h2>(i)        Did the motion judge err in holding that the legacy vested in
    Andrea Stevenson on the death of the testatrix and was therefore subject
    to garnishment?</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge relied upon <i>In Re Robbins</i>, [1907] 2
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Ch.</st1:country-region>
    8 (C.A.) in concluding that the legacy had vested in Andrea Stevenson on
    the death of the testatrix.  In the <i>Robbins</i> case, the testator, Henry
    Robbins, by his will directed his trustees to purchase, out of the residue
    of his estate, a government annuity for his wife of the annual value of <span style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";'>£</span>400
    for her life.  Mr. Robbins died on October 11, 1905.  His wife, Jemima Robbins,
    died sixteen days later on October 27, 1905.  Mr. Robbins’s will was not
    proved at the time of his wife’s death.  His wife had not made any election
    to take the value of the annuity in cash prior to her death.  The question
    before the court was whether the personal representatives of Mrs. Robbins
    were entitled to be paid a lump sum in respect of the annuity.  The judge
    at first instance and the Court of Appeal held that the legacy and the right
    to take its present value in a lump sum vested in Mrs. Robbins at the time
    of her husband’s death.  Cozens-Hardy M.R., writing for the Court of Appeal,
    said at p. 11:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Now the effect of a direction to apply a definite
    sum of money in the purchase of a life annuity for the sole benefit of a
    particular individual has been often discussed, and now admits of no reasonable
    doubt.  It is regarded as a legacy of the definite sum which will be satisfied
    by the purchase of an annuity, but unless and until the purchase is made
    it is regarded as a legacy of the definite sum vesting in the intended annuitant
    on the testator’s death.  It makes no difference that the annuity is not
    directed to be purchased until some future period if the annuitant survives
    the testator and dies before that period.  The legal personal representative
    of the intended annuitant can claim the definite sum as a legacy.  </p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'><i>Robbins</i> was cited with approval
    by the Ontario High Court of Justice in <i>Re Gildersleeve</i>, [1934] O.W.N.
    51, at p. 52.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for the appellant distinguishes <i>Robbins</i> on the basis that the annuity
    in that case was not “non-commutable”.  Counsel further submits that in more
    modern times, the courts have taken notice of non-commutable annuities and
    their utility in structured settlements.  That said, I do not find that such
    a development advances the argument in this case on either side.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for the appellant cited <i>Morayniss v. McArthur</i> (1980), 30 O.R. (2d)
    226 (H.C.J.) in support of this ground of appeal.  In that case, Mr. Morayniss,
    a solicitor, obtained a default judgment against his client, Mr. McArthur,
    for his fees and sought a charging order against Mr. McArthur’s share of
    his father’s estate.  Morayniss obtained an order <i>nisi</i> under the <i>Judicature
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1970, c. 228.  The executor of the estate brought an application
    to prevent the order from being made absolute.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>Morayniss</i>,
    the will provided that the trustees of the estate were obliged to pay a life
    annuity to Mr. McArthur upon his reaching the age of 40 years.  The judge
    hearing the application declined to exercise his discretion to make the charging
    order on the basis that Morayniss’s accounts should be assessed by a taxing
    officer and, in any event, that a charging order would not be available because
    Mr. McArthur had not yet reached the age of 40.  The application judge concluded
    at p. 234:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In other words, I feel very strongly that in this
    particular case a charging order which would be of limited effect only, should
    be deferred until the judgment debtor becomes 40 and I therefore indicate
    that the trustee has shown cause why the order <i>nisi</i> should not be
    made absolute.  </p>

    be at odds with the reasoning in <i>Robbins</i>.  If it is, this court is
    not bound by it.  However, <i>Morayniss</i> is distinguishable from this
    case in that the charging order sought by the solicitor is given at the discretion
    of the application judge.  The garnishment, on the other hand, is available
    to a judgment creditor as of right, once the garnishment order is obtained,
    pursuant to rule 60.08(1) of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A creditor under an order for the payment or recovery

    respondent relies upon <i>Robbins</i> but also relies upon a judgment of
    the British Columbia Supreme Court, <i>Lotzkar v. McLean</i> (1979), 15 B.C.L.R.
    259.  In that case, the testator’s will provided that the residue of his
    estate was to be divided into two equal parts for his two children.  He directed
    his trustees to use each of the two parts for the purchase of two life annuities – one
    for each of the children.  The will further provided:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(v) … I give my Trustees absolute discretion to
    purchase such annuities from the Government of Canada or any life assurance
    company as they may deem advisable and I DECLARE that each of my said children
    JOSEPH LOTZKAR and LOUISE KETTLEMAN, shall not be allowed to have the value
    of such said life annuity in lieu thereof. …</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>(vii)     IN THE FURTHER EVENT that any of my said
    children shall be living at my death and thereafter die before all the benefits
    from such Annuity so purchased for him or her have been paid to him or her
    as the case may be, I DIRECT my Trustees TO PAY AND TRANSFER OVER such remaining
    benefit to the issue of such child of mine upon such issue thereof attaining
    the age of twenty-one (21) years (and if more than one equally between them).</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    children, who were two of the three trustees, moved for directions requesting
    that each of them be paid a lump sum in lieu of the life annuities.  The
    main issue addressed by the chambers judge was “whether or not [the two children]
    each have absolute beneficial interests and, if so, are the trustees bound
    to pay lump sums to each of them in lieu of the annuities if they so request”: <i>Lotzkar</i> at
    p. 261.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    chambers judge held that the two children were entitled to lump sum payments
    in lieu of the life annuities.  He said at p. 262:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Most of the relevant law is concisely expressed
    in the following short extract from Jarman on Wills, 7<span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";'>th </span>ed. (1930), vol. 2, p. 1109:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>(vii) <i>Sum given to buy Annuity</i>. – Where
    there is a bequest of a sum of money to buy an annuity, the annuitant is
    entitled to have the money, because the annuity might at once be sold, and
    it would be idle to compel the annuitant to have an annuity which he could
    resell; <u>this is the case even where the testator shows clearly that he
    means the annuity to be held by trustees as a personal provision for the
    annuitant, or even where he expressly declares that the annuitant shall not
    be allowed to accept the value of the annuity in lieu thereof, or that it
    shall cease on alienation, unless such a condition is made effective by a
    gift over</u>.  [Underlining added.]</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>The chambers judge also observed
    that if the purchase of the annuity had been restricted to a Government of
    Canada annuity, the children would not have been entitled to call for a lump
    sum because the <i>Government Annuities Act</i>, R.S.C. 1970, c. G-6, s.
    10(1), makes the property in an annuity or the benefits arising therefrom
    inalienable.  The chambers judge further observed that, in any event, a Government
    of Canada annuity was not available in this case because the amounts involved
    were larger than the amounts permitted to be paid under the <i>Government
    Annuities Act</i>.  In the case at bar, the trustees’ discretion was absolute
    and permitted them to purchase the annuity from a life assurance company.  </p>

    for Kirsten Stevenson conceded that if the trustees paid out the funds pursuant
    to the notice of garnishment, it would have the effect of frustrating the
    intent of the testatrix.  That said, the law as articulated by the English
    Court of Appeal in <i>Robbins</i> to the effect that the legacy of Andrea
    Stevenson vested on the death of her mother leads to that result.  </p>
  <h2>(iii)     Did the motion judge err in failing to treat Andrea Stevenson’s
    share as having already been converted into a non-commutable annuity?</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    is no basis for concluding that the legacy of Andrea Stevenson had been converted
    into a non-commutable annuity.  The evidence is to the contrary.  An application
    form for the annuity had been received by the solicitors for the estate from
    an insurance broker on January 23, 2008, but had not been completed when
    the solicitors received the notice of garnishment on January 25, 2008.  </p>
  <h2>(iv)      Did the motion judge err in failing to distinguish between a
    beneficiary’s right to demand payment of capital and the rights of third
    parties, such as judgment creditors, to make the same demand?</h2>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for the appellant argues that while a beneficiary may be able to call for
    a payment of a lump sum in lieu of the purchase of an annuity, a third party
    judgment creditor has no such right.  In the view that I take of the applicable
    law, there is no basis to conclude that the trial judge erred in failing
    to make that distinction.  According to the applicable law, the sum of money
    available for the purchase of the annuity vested in Andrea Stevenson and
    was therefore subject to garnishment.</p>
  <h2>(v)       Did the motion judge err in finding that the encroachment on
    the capital of the share of Andrea Stevenson in favour of the judgment creditor
    was not prejudicial to the rights of the appellant?</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant submits that the enforcement of the garnishment order would consume
    virtually all of his mother’s share of the estate capital and there would
    be little, if any, funds left to benefit him after her death.  He argues
    that he is akin to a remain-derman and that the motion judge erred in failing
    to consider the prejudicial effect on his interest in the estate.  In my
    view, the provision in the will benefiting the appellant on the death of
    his mother is conditional on there being funds remaining in respect of the
    legacy to his mother.  There is nothing in the will that requires the trustees
    to preserve any funds for the benefit of the appellant after his mother’s
    death.  I can find no error in the finding of the trial judge on this issue.</p>

    appellant submits that the original motion for directions was brought in
    respect of the intention of the testatrix to benefit her daughter Andrea
    Stevenson by the provision of a non-commutable life annuity.  The appellant
    submits that his role was to uphold the intention of the testatrix as expressed
    in the will.  Therefore, the costs should be paid by the estate.  In my view,
    this is a mischaracterization of the issue before the court.  The intention
    of the testatrix was clear and was not in issue.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant further submits, in the alternative, that the litigation arose
    because the respondent, Kirsten Stevenson, sought to enforce an unrelated
    debt against Andrea Stevenson’s share in the estate.  The motion was brought
    by the trustees in response to the notice of garnishment for the benefit
    of the beneficiaries of the estate.</p>

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent submits that the traditional rule in estate litigation that the
    estate bears the costs of all parties is no longer applicable since this
    court’s judgment in <i>McDougald Estate v. Gooderham</i> (2005), 255 D.L.R.
    (4<span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";'>th</span>) 425.  In <i>McDougald</i>,
    Gillese J.A., writing for the court, said at paras. 79 and 80:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Traditionally, Canadian courts of first instance
    have followed the approach of the English courts.  While the principle was
    that costs of all parties were ordered payable out of the estate if the dispute
    arose from an ambiguity or omission in the testator’s will or other conduct
    of the testator, or there were reasonable grounds upon which to question
    the will’s validity, such cost awards became virtually automatic.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>However, the traditional approach has been – in
    my view, correctly – displaced.  The modern approach to fixing costs in estate
    litigation is to carefully scrutinize the litigation and, unless the court
    finds that one or more of the public policy considerations set out above
    applies, to follow the costs rules that apply in civil litigation.  Four
    cases usefully illustrate this modern approach.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    this case could be characterized as primarily a dispute between two of the
    beneficiaries, there was a dearth of legal authority on the specific issue
    to be determined.  In my view, the trustees adopted a reasonable course in
    seeking the decision of the court, given the lack of judicial authority in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario.  The issue, while of significant importance to beneficiaries, appears
    to have broader implications in respect of the rights of judgment creditors

style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge gave no reasons why he ordered the appellant to pay the costs
    of both the trustees and the appellant.  In fairness, he was not provided
    with comprehensive submissions on the issue.  Nevertheless, counsel for the
    appellant made the following submission:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I think the costs should come out of the estate
    and particularly, Your Honour, I think that these are, these were important
    points that trustees needed direction on, and that the litigants should not
    be punished for bringing this motion for directions and making submissions
    to the court.</p>
  <p class=ParaNo style='line-height:normal'>In my view, the motion judge erred
    in failing to appreciate the need for the trustees to bring the application
    before him and the broader issue that was involved.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal'><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    would give leave to appeal the order for costs and allow the appeal by setting
    aside the motion judge’s order and replacing it with an order that the costs
    of the trustees in the amount of $1,500 and of the respondent Kirsten Stevenson,
    in the amount of $3,000, should be paid by the estate.  I do not agree that
    the quantum of costs is exorbitant.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for the respondent, Kirsten Stevenson, in effect, seeks costs on a substantial
    indemnity basis.  In my view, this case should not attract substantial indemnity
    costs.  Success has been divided in this court.  However, most of the time
    was spent on the merits.  I would award costs to the respondent, Kirsten
    Stevenson, on a partial indemnity scale fixed in the amount of $3,500, inclusive
    of disbursements and GST, payable by the appellant.</p>
