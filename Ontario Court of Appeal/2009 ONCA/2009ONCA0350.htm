      were amended on the same day to include a pleading against the Hospital
      of spoliation of evidence. Mr. Hilik Elmaliah and his firm, Sommers &amp; Roth,
      have acted for the plaintiffs in both actions from the beginning. </span></p>

      Health Program, was responsible for nursing in the labour and delivery
      unit of the Hospital. She had been with the Hospital since November 2002.

      the Hospital records and transcripts of the examinations for discovery
      of individual defendants in the Stewart action. His letter also described
      the background facts in the case. The letter did not explicitly seek her
      opinion or otherwise outline the nature of the retainer being proposed,
      but simply requested that Ms. Holden contact Mr. Elmaliah at her earliest
      possible convenience to discuss the matter further.</span></p>

      December 11, 2006, Ms. Holden, who has provided expert reports in a number
      of cases to a number of law firms, including Sommers &amp; Roth, wrote
      to Mr. Elmaliah with her opinion on the standard of nursing care given
      to Andrae Stewart by the Hospital and the defendant nurses. Her opinion
      was that in this case the nurses did not properly monitor or document the
      fetal heart rate and uterine activity prior to birth. She commented adversely
      on the inadequacy of the forms used by the Hospital at that time, and its
      failure to maintain certain records. She concluded that the nursing care
      was substandard, and led to Andrae’s present condition. </span></p>

      with counsel the strategy for the conduct of the defence in both actions.

      February 13, 2007, counsel for the Hospital wrote to Mr. Elmaliah, saying
      that his retaining of Ms. Holden as an expert had given his firm unauthorized
      access to information subject to solicitor-client privilege and therefore
      his firm must remove itself as solicitor of record in both actions. Mr.
      Elmaliah responded by letter the same day. He took the position that the
      two actions were not related and had nothing to do with each other. He
      noted that Ms. Holden was retained in the Stewart action but not in the
      Miele action, that no representative of the Hospital was discovered in
      the Stewart action, that there is no property in an expert witness, that
      he had had no conversations with Ms. Holden regarding the Stewart action,
      and that he had no intention of discussing with Ms. Holden any privileged
      information regarding either action. He concluded by making it clear that
      his firm would not remove itself as counsel.</span></p>

      J. first determined that Ms. Holden was in possession of confidential information
      attributable to a solicitor-client relationship and that this information
      was relevant to both actions. He then addressed the question of whether
      counsel for the appellants had received this confidential information.
      He applied the reasoning in <i>MacDonald Estate v. Martin</i>, [1990] 3
      S.C.R. 1235, to conclude that the relationship between counsel and an expert
      witness meant that it was appropriate to infer receipt by counsel of confidential
      information, and that the appellants had not rebutted that inference. He
      went on to apply a presumption that this created a risk that the confidential
      information would be misused to the prejudice of the Hospital and defendant
      nurses. He concluded that the appellants had not rebutted that inference.
      Finally, he found that in light of the factors described in <i>Celanese
      Canada Inc. v. Murray Demolition Corp.</i>, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 189, removal
      was the appropriate remedy.</span></p>

      action, would refrain from communicating with her about either action,
      would destroy all copies of her report of December 11, 2006, and would
      consent to the appointment of independent counsel to review their files
      to verify that they had been purged of any information from Ms. Holden.
      However, the appellants also conceded that if they were limited to the
      one issue on which leave was granted, the appeal could not succeed. In

    Divisional Court. The appellants on the other hand, sought leave on all issues.
    This court granted leave, but without limiting the issues in any way. As

    referred to the result of the leave hearing in the

      central issue is whether counsel for the appellants were properly found
      to be in possession of relevant solicitor-client information to which they
      have no claim of right such that they must be removed as the appellants’ solicitor

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Whether through advertence or

      an umbrella that covers confidences of differing centrality and importance,
      such possession by the opposing party affects the integrity of the administration
      of justice. Parties should be free to litigate their disputes without fear
      that their opponent has obtained an unfair insight into secrets disclosed
      in confidence to their legal advisors. The defendant’s witnesses ought
      not to have to worry in the course of being cross-examined that the cross-examiner’s
      questions are prompted by information that had earlier been passed in confidence
      to the defendant’s solicitors. Such a possibility destroys the level playing
      field and creates a serious risk to the integrity of the administration

      first question is easily answered in the affirmative. Counsel for the appellants
      in this court, who was retained only following the decision of Pattillo
      J., did not contest the point. Ms. Holden was privy on a number of occasions
      to solicitor-client communications in both actions. She was to be the Hospital’s
      representative discovered in both actions. She was prepared for discovery
      and was in fact examined in one of them. The claims in each action are
      pleaded in identical terms and the actions have proceeded in tandem from
      their inception. There can be no doubt that Ms. Holden has received confidential
      information in these very actions that is attributable to the solicitor-client
      relationship between the respondents and their counsel.</span></p>

      second question is more difficult. In determining whether counsel for the
      appellants was in receipt of the confidential information protected by
      the solicitor-client privilege held by the respondents, Pattillo J. applied
      the approach set out in <i>MacDonald Estate</i>. In my view he was correct

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>In my opinion, once it is shown
      by the client that there existed a previous relationship which is sufficiently
      related to the retainer from which it is sought to remove the solicitor,
      the court should infer that confidential information was imparted unless
      the solicitor satisfies the court that no information was imparted which
      could be relevant. This will be a difficult burden to discharge. Not only
      must the court’s degree of satisfaction be such that it would withstand
      the scrutiny of the reasonably informed member of the public that no such
      information passed, but the burden must be discharged without revealing
      the specifics of the privileged communication. Nonetheless, I am of the
      opinion that the door should not be shut completely on a solicitor who
      wishes to discharge this heavy burden.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellants assert that this approach should not be extended to an expert
      witness who has received privileged information from one party relevant
      to the matter and is then retained by opposing counsel, because an expert
      is not a fact witness, but  merely provides an opinion based on facts supplied
      to the expert.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Despite
      Mr. MacKenzie’s able argument, I disagree. In my view, it is appropriate
      to apply the <i>MacDonald Estate </i>approach to assess whether, when an
      expert has received solicitor-client information from one party and then
      is retained by opposing counsel, opposing counsel has acquired that information.
      The court should infer that confidential information was imparted unless
      opposing counsel satisfies the court that no such information passed. The
      court must ask itself whether the reasonably informed member of the public
      would be so satisfied. This will be a heavy burden for opposing counsel
      to discharge.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There
      are a number of reasons why this approach, first enunciated in <i>MacDonald

  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First,
      like the transferring lawyer, the expert in these circumstances serves
      as a vehicle for the potential transmission of confidential information
      to the opposing firm of solicitors. The expert comes to the opposing firm
      with confidential information relevant to the matter at hand. In this case,
      there were two such matters, one the very one in which the expert was retained
      by opposing counsel, and the other a closely related case with identically
      pleaded issues. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second,
      the relationship between expert and counsel <i>prima facie</i> entails
      the sharing of information about the facts and issues in the case. The
      expert cannot be expected to screen out of those communications the confidential
      information the expert has previously received that is of relevance to
      the case. This is particularly so since experts need have no training in
      identifying what of previously received information is legally privileged.
      In <i>MacDonald Estate</i>,<i> </i>at p. 1261, the court concluded that
      the transferring lawyer cannot compartmentalize his or her mind to screen
      out the solicitor-client information. No more should be expected of the
      expert in similar circumstances.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third,
      since the question is what, if any, confidential information was acquired
      by the opposing firm, placing the onus on it to rebut the presumption is
      simply to put that onus on the party best positioned to speak to a part
      of the question, namely what information was in fact acquired, whether
      confidential or not. In my view, it would not be appropriate to place on
      the party holding the solicitor-client privilege the burden of showing
      that confidential information has wound up in the wrong hands, because
      this could require that party to reveal the very information for which
      protection is sought.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally,
      the requirement that the opposing law firm show that it did not acquire
      any confidential information to which it has no claim of right reflects
      the burden of persuasion found in the overriding policy requirement that
      the public, represented by the reasonably informed person, should be satisfied
      that no use of confidential information would occur.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Thus,
      unless counsel for the appellants can demonstrate that not only the court
      but also the reasonably informed member of the public would be satisfied
      that no confidential information was imparted by Ms. Holden, the court
      should infer that confidential information relevant to both actions passed. </span></p>

      his letter to her of August 8, 2006 and her written response of December
      11, 2006. He also said that neither he nor his firm received any privileged
      or confidential information from Ms. Holden which emanated from her employment
      with the hospital, although I am uncertain about how he would know what

      them with respect to the Stewart action either before or after she sent

      the other side of the ledger, there are a number of considerations. Ms.
      Holden acknowledged in cross-examination on her affidavits that her usual
      practice when requested to provide an opinion was to contact counsel after
      reviewing the records. She indicated that she likely would have called
      Mr. Elmaliah before delivering her report to say that she had reviewed
      the records and to discuss her draft report with him.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Indeed,
      Mr. Elmaliah’s original letter invited communication. It was entirely silent
      on the precise task asked of her, thereby almost necessitating some contact.
      And it explicitly requested Ms. Holden to contact him to discuss the matter
      further.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>One
      communication that Mr. Elmaliah undeniably received from Ms. Holden is
      her written opinion of December 11, 2006. We cannot know for certain the
      extent to which it may reflect the confidential information that she had
      previously received. Her assertion that she relied only on the written
      material for Mr. Elmaliah requires the dubious assumption that she was
      able to compartmentalize her mind.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      addition, the close linkage between the two cases makes it likely that
      any communications that did take place between Mr. Elmaliah and Ms. Holden
      would have had relevance to both actions.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'><span
lang=EN-US>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally,
      it must be noted that although Mr. Elmaliah was aware of Ms. Holden’s role
      in both actions, he has offered no explanation for then seeking to retain
      her as an expert. Nor did he take any steps to ensure that neither he nor
      his firm would acquire any information from her that arose from her close
      involvement with the parties that he was suing and for which privilege
      might be claimed. A suspicion that some informational advantage was anticipated
      is hardly surprising and simply adds to the appellants’ challenge of satisfying
      the court and the reasonably informed public that no confidential information
      was acquired.</span></p>

      these various considerations together, I conclude, as did Pattillo J.,
      that the appellants have not rebutted the inference that they received
      confidential information from Ms. Holden that is attributable to solicitor-client
      communications between the respondents and their counsel that is relevant
      to both actions. I do not think that the reasonably informed member of

        this approach is not to be confined to the circumstances of the transferring
        lawyer, but that once lawyers for the opposing party acquire information
        protected by solicitor-client privilege held by another party, the opposing
        party has the onus of rebutting the presumption of prejudice. At para.

      No steps were taken beforehand that might have walled off those in the

        also with the right of litigants to select counsel of their choice. <i>Celanese</i> makes
        it clear that if the integrity of the justice system can be protected
        with a remedy short of removal, that lesser remedy should be employed.

      consideration is what counsel for the appellants did upon learning of the
      problem. The short answer is that until the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address

    Divisional Court hearing, counsel denied the problem, saying that nothing
    needed to be done. They were wrong. Here too they must bear responsibility.
    While the solution proposed by the appellants speaks to the future, it does
    nothing to address the risk of prejudice to the respondents from confidential
    information already acquired by counsel for the appellants that they cannot
    be expected to screen out of their thinking.</span></p>

      third consideration concerns the degree of prejudice that may arise from
      the confidential information. Given the nature of the solicitor-client
      communications to which Ms. Holden was privy, I agree with Pattillo J.
      that in the hands of counsel for the appellants it would cause significant
      prejudice to the respondents. The appellants have not shown that the confidential
      information acquired by them represents little risk of prejudice to the
      respondents.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally,
      the litigation was at an early stage when it was before Pattillo J. The
      appeal process has since then brought the litigation much closer to the
      initially fixed trial dates. However, that should not dramatically change
      the impact of this consideration given that it was undertaken by the appellants.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      light of these considerations, I conclude that there is no remedy short
      of removal that can alleviate the adverse impact on the integrity of the
      administration of justice created by the present circumstances. Permitting
      counsel for the appellants to remain as solicitors of record would leave
      that adverse impact undiminished. Hence the right of the appellants to
      the counsel of their choice must yield.</span></p>
