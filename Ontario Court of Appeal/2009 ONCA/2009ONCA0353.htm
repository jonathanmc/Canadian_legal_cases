    appellant advances several related grounds of appeal against his conviction
    of sexual assault after a trial in the Superior Court of Justice before a
    judge sitting without a jury. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first ground of appeal arises from the following finding of the trial judge:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I, however, agree with the submissions of the Crown
    that it is not necessary for the court to be satisfied that there was sexual
    intercourse that took place, provided the court is satisfied that there was
    a sexual assault and/or sexual interference. As the complainant was under
    age 14 years at the time, her consent is not an issue. If the court is satisfied
    beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant, while naked, placed himself
    on top of the complainant with his penis coming into contact with the complainant’s
    body that would constitute a sexual assault and sexual interference.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant says that this finding is unreasonable in light of the complainant’s
    evidence that sexual intercourse took place over an extended period of time,
    or the finding is flawed because it is founded on a misapprehension of the
    evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this, as in any case, it was open to the trial judge, as the trier of fact,
    to accept some, none or all of the complainant’s evidence. A failure to find
    that an act of vaginal sexual intercourse took place does not make the finding
    made in this case unreasonable. The trial judge plainly accepted the complainant’s
    testimony that the appellant got on top of her and touched her vaginal area
    with his penis. That the trial judge had a reasonable doubt about the degree
    of penetration, if any, does not render the decision unreasonable in all
    the circumstances of this case, including but not only: </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>i.          the complainant’s age at the time of these events; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>ii.         the complainant’s admitted uncertainty about the extent of
    penetration;  and </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:
normal'>iii.       the complainant’s evidence about the difficulties the appellant
    had in achieving penetration. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>The finding does not reflect
    any misapprehension of the complainant’s evidence. At best, rather, it suggests
    a reasonable doubt with respect to some part of it. There can be no doubt
    that what the trial judge found was, as a matter of law, a  sexual assault.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also claims error in the trial judge’s interpretation and treatment
    of certain expert evidence adduced at trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    forensic biologist described her findings on examination of the complainant’s
    underwear for the presence of semen, saliva and blood. A medical doctor,
    who specialized in paediatrics, gave evidence of his findings on examination
    of the complainant’s genitalia within days of the alleged offence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According
    to the appellant, the trial judge erred by failing to consider the totality  of
    the DNA evidence. To be more specific, the trial judge, the appellant submits,
    should have taken into account that the forensic biologist found at least
    three individuals’ DNA samples on the complainant’s underwear, including
    the complainant’s own saliva. Further, he says the expert acknowledged that
    there were several ways in which the appellant’s wet semen could have been
    transferred to the complainant’s underwear. After all, he reminds, the appellant
    and the complainant shared both bathroom and laundry facilities. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    would not give effect to this ground of appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defence advanced at trial, supported by the appellant’s own evidence, was
    that the alleged assault never occurred. The complainant testified that her
    laundry was kept separate from that of the appellant. She changed her underwear
    daily and removed the underwear worn on the day of the alleged assault from
    her laundry hamper in an unwashed state. The trial record is barren of evidentiary
    support for any innocent or accidental means of transfer. The presence of
    other DNA samples on the underwear does not detract from the fact that the
    only DNA profile detected in analysis of the sperm fraction of one of the
    stains was that of the appellant, and that the possibility of another person
    with the same profile was 1 in 96 trillion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also contends that the trial judge failed to appreciate that the
    complainant’s version of events was inconsistent with the expert evidence
    about the condition of her genitalia when she was examined by a doctor days
    after the alleged offence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge was alive to this argument as it was advanced at trial. He did
    not misapprehend either the substance or the effect of this evidence. It
    was open to him to find that, on the evidence taken as whole, any conflict
    between the testimony of the complainant and that of the examining physician
    did not raise a reasonable doubt about the appellant’s guilt. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    remaining grounds of appeal against conviction may be considered together.
    They allege a failure to consider whether the evidence as a whole raised
    a reasonable doubt about the appellant’s guilt (the third step of <i>W. (D.)</i>,
    and a reversal of the onus of proof by imposing on the appellant the burden
    of establishing a reasonable explanation for the deposit of his wet semen
    on the complainant’s underwear. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    record puts paid to each claim of error. The trial judge articulated the
    governing legal principles, including the analysis mandated by <i>W. (D.)</i>.
    He considered the cumulative effect of all the evidence, including the complainant’s
    testimony, the expert evidence, the appellant’s denial and the evidence offered
    to show that the appellant lacked the opportunity to commit the offence.
    He found the allegations proven beyond a reasonable doubt. He was under no
    obligation to refer to and reconcile every syllable of evidence uttered at
    trial. His reasons are faithful to the principles he articulated and reflect
    no misapprehension of evidence or of the governing legal principles. He did
    not shift the onus of proof either expressly or by necessary implication.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal from conviction is dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also seeks leave to appeal sentence. The trial judge imposed a
    sentence of imprisonment in a federal penitentiary for a term of three years.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    offence involved the abuse of an 11 year old child on a single occasion by
    a mature adult to whose care the complainant had been entrusted by her father.
    The appellant is a mature, remorseless recidivist whose prior convictions
    include offences against the person of others, albeit not sexual offences,
    and repeated violations of probationary terms. Indeed, the appellant was
    on probation at the time he committed this offence. </p>

    convicting the appellant, the trial judge found that
    “in all of the circumstances it is a reasonable inference to make that [the
    appellant’s sperm] had got [on the complainant’s underwear] as a result of
    him lying naked on top of her while she was naked for some period of time.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    sentencing the appellant, the trial judge recited, and appears to have accepted
    the complainant’s testimony that the appellant had laid on top of her and
    that he had tried to insert his penis into her vagina and that he had difficulty
    doing so. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    basis on which the trial judge sentenced the appellant appears to reflect
    a more invasive sexual assault than that for which he had found the appellant
    guilty. While we acknowledge that the absence of penetration does not automatically
    relegate the sexual abuse of a child to a lower range of sexual offence,
    there is no question that lying on top of someone is less invasive than attempted
    sexual intercourse. Accordingly, we are of the opinion that the trial judge
    erred. Consequently, we are called upon to impose a fit sentence. In our
    opinion, having regard to all of the circumstances of this offence and the
    offender who committed it, a fit sentence is imprisonment in the penitentiary
    for two years. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal'>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    leave to appeal sentence is granted,  the appeal is allowed and a sentence
    of imprisonment in a federal penitentiary for a term of two years is imposed
    in lieu of the sentence imposed at trial.</p>
