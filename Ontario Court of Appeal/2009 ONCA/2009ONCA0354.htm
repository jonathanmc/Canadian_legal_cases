    this case, a judge of the Superior Court of Justice decided that a declaration
    that some class members were entitled to an award of retroactive and future
    Canada Pension Plan (CPP) benefits was both a “<span
lang=EN-US>monetary award” under the<i> CPA</i> and a “benefit” under the <i>CPP</i>.  The
    judge also decided that the prohibition against assignment or charge of CPP
    benefits prevailed over the first charge the lawyers would usually have over
    a monetary award under the <i>CPA</i>.</span></p>

      Hislop and several others (the Hislop class) undertook class action proceedings
      in which they claimed that certain amendments made to the <i>CPP</i> by
      the <i>Modernization of Benefits and Obligations Act</i>, S.C. 2000, c.
      12, offended s. 15(1) of the <i>Charter – </i>the class members had been
      denied CPP survivors pensions because they and their deceased partners
      were of the same sex<i>. </i> The Hislop class sought declaratory relief,
      damages and a monetary judgment.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

      trial judge struck down two subsections of the <i>CPP</i> under s. 52(1)
      of the <i>Constitution Act</i>, <i>1982</i>, being Schedule B to the <i>Canada
      Act 1982 </i>(U.K.), 1982, c. 11, and granted class members a constitutional
      exemption from two general sections of the <i>CPP</i>, ss. 60(2) and 72(1).  In
      the result, each class member would receive full arrears on their pensions,
      depending on the date of their same-sex partner’s death, as far back as
      1985, plus the prospective CPP Survivor’s Pension: <i>Hislop v. Canada
      (Attorney General) </i>(2003), 234 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 465 (Ont. S.C.).</span></p>

      of invalidity of ss. 44(1.1) and 72(2) of the <i>CPP </i>was upheld.  In
      the end, otherwise eligible class members are entitled to CPP survivors’ pensions.
      The amount of arrears to which individual class members are entitled varies
      with the date of application:

      to the application of the 4.8 multiplier, PCG has incurred total fees in
      excess of $5.3 million and has received fees, exclusive of all disbursements,

      of pension arrears owing to Hislop class members, according to its interpretation

      65(1) of the <i>CPP </i>prohibits assignment and transactions purporting
      to assign benefits under the <i>CPP</i>. Similarly, the subsection bars
      charging and transactions purporting to charge benefits under the <i>CPP</i>.  The
      benefits are exempt from seizure and execution either at law or in equity.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      first issue that ripens for decision here is whether what the Hislop class
      obtained was a “benefit” under s. 2(1) of the <i>CPP</i>, thus whether
      PCG’s s. 32(3) <i>CPA</i> claim falls foul of s. 65(1) of the<i> CPP</i>.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Positions of the Parties</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>PCG
      denies that s. 65(1) of the <i>CPP </i>bars their claim under s. 32(3)

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>PCG
      argues that the monetary award the Hislop class achieved only became available
      to class members and payable to them as a result of a successful constitutional
      challenge to the provisions of the <i>CPA</i>. In other words, the remedy,
      although it related to CPP<i> </i>benefits, was <i>not payable</i> <i>under</i> the
      CPP as it must be to trigger the prohibition of s. 65(1) of the <i>CPP</i>.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellants also say that the application of s. 65(1) would undermine the
      access to justice principles that underpin the <i>CPA</i>.  Section 65(1)
      is typical of pension legislation and its rigorous enforcement would stifle
      future proceedings similar to those undertaken here.</span></p>

      is the appellants’ position that the remedy granted here, when all is said
      and done, is a “monetary award” within s. 32(3) of the <i>CPA</i>.  After
      all, the remedy resulted effectively in an award of arrears of pension
      benefits, said otherwise, the payment of money, to those who could establish
      their eligibility in accordance with the CPP scheme.  The mere fact that
      a declaration was a necessary first step does not alter the inalienable
      fact that the ultimate result of the litigation was that qualified applicants
      in the Hislop class will be paid money under the CPP.</span></p>

      here was declaratory only. The final decision simply declared an entitlement
      to CPP benefits, the right to stand in line, along with others, to obtain
      benefits on proof of entitlement. The mere fact that the declaratory relief
      granted will ultimately generate money for eligible Hislop class members

      the payment provisions of the <i>Crown Liability and Proceedings Act</i>,

      appropriation of public monies and payment out of the Consolidated Revenue

      this case, the <i>CPP </i>qualifies as a law
    “in relation to old age pensions and supplementary benefits”.  But the <i>CPA</i> cannot
    claim any such constitutional foundation. The <i>CPA </i>is a statute of
    general application, a law that deals with procedure in civil matters.  The <i>CPA</i>,
    in its current form, is not and does not purport to be a law “in relation
    to old age pensions and supplementary benefits”. In the result, the conditions
    precedent to the rule establishing provincial paramountcy are not established.
    And so it is that the appellants cannot summon s. 94A in support of their
    claim that they are entitled to a first charge under s. 32(3) of the <i>CPA</i>.</span></p>
