  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (the “MOU”) with the
    respondent in respect of a property, referred to as the Ironstone property,
    which the parties planned to purchase jointly. Although the parties had contemplated
    entering into a more formal Joint Venture Agreement (the “JVA”), no agreement
    could be reached. At a shareholder meeting called by the parties in respect
    of their jointly held company incorporated for the purposes of completing
    this transaction, ICP Developments Inc., the appellants passed a motion declaring
    the MOU to be invalid. In consequence, this litigation ensued.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that the MOU constituted a binding contract between the
    parties. He further held that the appellants’
    actions in declaring the MOU invalid were a breach of the contract amounting
    to repudiation, and that the respondent had accepted this repudiation. The
    trial judge thus ordered that the respondent return the contributions made
    by the appellants toward the Ironstone property, and that the appellants
    transfer to the respondent their respective shares in ICP Developments Inc.
    The appellants appeal that judgment. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants raise several grounds of appeal. They contend that the trial judge
    erred in finding that the MOU was a binding contract. In the alternative,
    they argue that the respondent breached the MOU by presenting a draft of
    the JVA that was substantially different from what had been contemplated
    by the parties, and by incurring expenses in relation to the Ironstone property
    without approval from the appellants. The trial judge carefully reviewed
    the evidence, made the necessary findings of fact and construed the necessary
    documents in arriving at his decision that the MOU was a binding contract
    and that it had been repudiated by the appellants. We find no palpable and
    overriding errors with respect to his consideration of the evidence. Nor
    do we find any errors of law in the trial judge’s reasons in respect of these
    grounds of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    central issue on this appeal is whether the trial judge erred in finding
    that the respondent’s unsuccessful attempt to gain a secret commission from
    the purchase of the Ironstone property did not amount to a breach of fiduciary
    duty. The appellants argue that the mere fact that the respondent attempted
    to make a secret profit is sufficient to ground a breach of fiduciary duty.
    They submit that, by considering the fact that the respondent’s plans were
    ultimately unsuccessful, the trial judge applied the wrong legal test.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    would not give effect to this ground of appeal. In coming to his conclusion,
    the trial judge considered all of the evidence, including the fact that the
    respondent’s request for a secret commission from the real estate broker
    was rejected and that no payment was ever made. It is implicit in his reasons
    that, despite their knowledge in March of 2006 that the respondent had attempted
    to obtain a secret commission, the appellants did not claim a breach of fiduciary
    duty until day five of the trial when they sought leave to amend their pleadings
    to include this allegation. It is clear that the trial judge’s decision that
    there was no breach of fiduciary duty turned on the fact that the request
    for the secret commission went nowhere from the outset, as well as on the
    fact that the appellants did not raise this issue in the proceedings until
    late in the trial. We see no reason for interfering with the conclusion of
    the trial judge that there was no breach of fiduciary duty in these circumstances. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants further argue that the trial judge erred in granting rescission
    as a remedy. The trial judge stated that the appellants conceded during argument
    that rescission was the appropriate remedy if he held that there was a binding
    contract. In the face of this concession, we find no error in the granting
    of rescission. Quite apart from the concession during argument, we are of
    the view that there was no error in granting rescission in these circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal is dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants shall pay to the respondent costs in the amount of $30,000 inclusive
    of disbursements and GST, as well as $5,000 for costs awarded to the respondent
    on the motion before Lang J.A.</p>
