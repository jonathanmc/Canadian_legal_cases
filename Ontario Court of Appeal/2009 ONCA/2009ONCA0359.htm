  <h2>(1)       Introduction</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants appeal the judgment of Howden J. of the Superior Court of Justice
    dated July 16, 2008: (i) declaring that the agreement of purchase and sale
    between the appellants and the McKee respondents (the “Agreement”) became
    null and void on February 1, 2006 and that the appellants have no interest
    in the property at issue; and (ii) ordering that the appellants’ caution
    and Certificate of Pending Litigation registered on title to the subject
    property be vacated.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants argue that the trial judge erred in his interpretation of the
    provisions of the Agreement concerning the requirements for the delivery
    by the appellants of a notice of waiver of a due diligence condition.  They
    contend that the delivery of their written waiver notice to the McKees’ residence
    and to the appellants’ real estate representative satisfied the contractual
    requirements for the effective waiver of the due diligence condition.</p>
  <h2>(2)       The Due Diligence Condition</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Agreement between the parties was expressly conditional on the performance
    of due diligence on the property by the appellants.  Schedule A to the Agreement
    contained the following provision:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>This Offer is conditional upon the Buyer performing
    due diligence on the Subject Property.  Unless the Buyer gives notice in
    writing <i>delivered to the Seller</i> not later than 5:59 p.m. on the 1<span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";'>st</span> day of February 2006, that
    this condition is fulfilled, this Offer shall be null and void and the deposit
    shall be returned to the Buyer in full, with interest and without deduction,
    and the Seller and the Buyer shall both be released from any further obligations
    under this Agreement.  This condition is included for the sole benefit of
    the Buyer and may be waived at its sole option by notice in writing <i>delivered
    to the Seller</i> within the time period stated herein.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    issue on this appeal is the meaning of the phrase “delivered to the Seller”,
    as it appears in this due diligence condition.  </p>
  <h2>(3)       Discussion</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants rely on the general notice provision set out in paragraph six
    of the Agreement to argue that the timely delivery of a written waiver notice
    to the McKees’ home and the provision of a copy of the waiver notice to the
    appellants’ real estate representative satisfied the notice requirements
    under the Agreement for waiver of the due diligence condition.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Under
    paragraph six of the Agreement, the McKees, as the “seller” of the property,
    appointed “the Listing Broker as Agent for the purpose of giving and receiving
    notices pursuant to this Agreement”.  Under the same provision, the appellants,
    as the “buyer” of the property, appointed “the Co-operating Broker” as agent
    for similar purposes.  The buyer’s appointment applied only if the Co-operating
    Broker represented the interests of the buyer in the purchase and sale transaction.  In
    this case, no Co-operating Broker was involved in the transaction.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Paragraph
    six of the Agreement also stipulated that “any notice shall be deemed given
    and received, when hand delivered to the address for service provided in
    the Acknowledgement below”.  In the case of the seller, the McKees’ home
    address was listed in the Acknowledgement section of the Agreement.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    light of this part of paragraph six, the appellants argue that their hand
    delivery of a written notice of waiver of the due diligence condition to
    the McKees’ home prior to 6:00 p.m. on February 1, 2006 constituted an effective
    waiver of the condition.  The trial judge disagreed.  He held that the notice
    requirement contained in the due diligence condition required that notice
    of any waiver of the condition be brought to the personal attention of the
    McKees.  As this did not occur in a timely fashion, the delivery requirement
    for an effective waiver of the condition was not satisfied and the Agreement
    became null and void.  We agree for several reasons.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    in contrast to many of the cases relied on by the appellants, the Agreement
    in this case contains several notice provisions.  Schedule A, however, provides
    for a notice requirement that is specific to the due diligence condition.  Schedule
    A is not part of the pre-prepared standard form of the Agreement.  It was
    negotiated and prepared by the parties.  Had the parties intended that the
    general notice provision set out in paragraph six of the Agreement apply
    to a notice of waiver of the due diligence condition, the specific notice
    requirement in Schedule A would have been unnecessary.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    the plain language of Schedule A, in our view, contemplates the actual delivery
    of a waiver notice to the McKees, failing which the Agreement became null
    and void.  The notice language used in the due diligence condition is unambiguous.  In
    contrast to other notice provisions in the Agreement, no mention is made
    in this part of Schedule A to the delivery of a waiver notice to the seller’s
    agent or to the seller’s house.  Nor does Schedule A mention the general
    notice provision contained in paragraph six, or provide –
    as paragraph six does – for the delivery of notice to the seller’s address
    for service set out in the Acknowledgement section of the Agreement.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third,
    we agree with counsel for the McKees’
    submission that the evidence of the circumstances surrounding the making
    of the Agreement tells strongly in favour of the conclusion that the parties
    intended that any waiver notice be brought to the personal attention of the
    McKees.  The trial judge found, and the record confirms, that in all matters
    of substance relating to the formation of the Agreement, the parties dealt
    with each other directly.  As the trial judge put it, “[t]he parties themselves
    drove the deal throughout its formation, including Schedule ‘A’.”  We note,
    as well, that Schedule A was prepared by the appellants’ solicitor, who must
    be taken to have been aware of the different forms of notice provisions set
    out in the Agreement.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    we reject the appellants’ assertion that the fact of RE/MAX’s dual agency
    role in this case permitted the effective delivery of the waiver notice to
    be accomplished by its delivery to the appellants’ own real estate representative.  There
    is simply no evidence on this record that the McKees – as the seller of the
    property – cloaked the appellants’ representative or RE/MAX generally with
    any authority to receive a waiver of the due diligence condition on their
    behalf.  Nor did the appellants’
    representative so conduct himself as to suggest that he understood that he
    enjoyed such authority and the trial judge so found.</p>
  <h2>(4)       Disposition</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    conclude, therefore, that the trial judge made no error in interpreting the
    notice requirement under the Agreement applicable to the waiver of the due
    diligence condition.  The appeal is dismissed.  As agreed by counsel, costs
    of the appeal are awarded to each respondent in the amount of $20,000, inclusive
    of disbursements and GST.</p>
