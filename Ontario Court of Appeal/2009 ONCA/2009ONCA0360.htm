  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues the trial judge misapprehended the evidence in failing to
    find that the contract included an implied term that the pretacked assemblies
    prepared by the respondent and to be presented to the appellant for robotic
    welding would be within tolerances that allowed the assembly to be robotically
    welded.  In other words, it argued that the respondent had an obligation
    to ensure that the assemblies were in robotically weldable condition.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not agree. The documents that were clearly part of the contract between
    the parties include the appellant’s proposal.  Two provisions of it are relevant
    here:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>(a)       “Thank you for your inquiry to B &amp; B Automation
    with regards to purchasing a robotic weld cell <u>which will finish weld
    your frame</u>.” [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>(b)       “The fixtures will be constructed in the following
    manner.  <u>A tooled nest will accept your pretacked frame assembly</u>.”  [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    provisions suggest that the appellant is contracting to create a tooled nest
    that will be able to accept the respondent’s pretacked assemblies in the
    form that they were being produced without alteration to the respondent’s
    pretack facility.  There is nothing in the documents to suggest that the
    respondent undertook to make modifications to its pretack assembly process
    in order to accommodate the appellant’s robotically welded process.  The
    respondent’s drawings do not depict the assemblies in the form that they
    would be presented for robotic welding.  Rather, the drawings only depict
    the final product with tolerances after the robotic welding has occurred.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, the evidence was clear that the appellant was the expert in robotic
    welding and was, therefore, in a better position to know what was required
    of the pretack assemblies to permit robotic welding.  The evidence indicated
    that the appellant knew before quoting that the respondent’s pretacked assemblies
    could present some difficulties for robotic welding. If the appellant had
    intended that the respondent be responsible for providing pretack assemblies
    in robotically weldable form, it could have included such a requirement in
    its proposal or invoice.  It did not do so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    the commercial reality of the arrangement between the parties support the
    conclusion that it is the appellant who should bear responsibility for ensuring
    that the assemblies met the standards required for robotic welding.  The
    appellant had the specialized expertise and knowledge of robotic welding
    and, in addition, was knowledgeable of the capabilities of the respondent’s
    pretack facility as it had manufactured it.  Thus, the commercial realities
    are consistent with the contract documents.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant relies on the evidence of Richard Goss who represented the respondent
    at the time the contract was formed.  In giving evidence about what might
    be an implied term in the contract, Mr. Goss spoke of the need to have the
    component parts of the pretack assembly within certain tolerances.  Mr. Goss’s
    evidence, however, did not go so far as to suggest that the respondent bore
    the responsibility to ensure that the pretacked assemblies themselves came
    within certain tolerances.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the end, there was ample evidence from which the trial judge could conclude
    that the terms of the contract between the parties did not contain a requirement
    that the respondent present for robotic welding only pretacked assemblies
    within tolerances fine enough to ensure the success of that welding.  We
    see no basis to interfere with this finding.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge concluded that the failure of the robotic weld cell to work properly
    was largely due to the fact that it was designed without regard to the limitations
    associated with the respondent’s pretacked assemblies.  He concluded that
    the weld cell designed and produced by the appellant was not reasonably fit
    for the purpose for which it was intended and that this went to the root
    of the contract.  In our view, this finding was open to him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal is dismissed.  Costs to the respondent on a partial indemnity basis
    fixed at $15,000.00 inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
