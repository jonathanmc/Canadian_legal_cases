  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant, a unit owner in a condominium, appeals from an order obtained
    by the respondent condominium corporation.  The order regulates and restricts
    the exercise of his rights to examine condominium records and to obtain copies
    of them. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Board of Directors of the respondent applied for the order on the basis that
    the appellant had made and pursued an unrelenting stream of requests for
    records to the point that his conduct, in effect, amounted to harassment
    of its management staff.  In its application, the respondent sought orders
    restraining the appellant from: harassing, communicating, or having contact
    with any member of the Board of Directors, management staff, security personnel,
    or any other employee of the respondent; requesting further condominium records
    from the respondent; and, coming within 25 feet of the respondent’s management
    office.  The respondent also requested that the appellant be ordered to either
    dismantle or render inactive his internet website.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge found that “the respondent’s conduct to the staff of the
    management office and to a member of the Board of Directors amounts to harassment.” She
    noted that although the <i>Condominium Act</i>, S.O. 1998, c. 19, did indeed
    give the appellant the right to examine the records of the respondent, he
    was not entitled to abuse that right “by conducting a campaign by siege against
    the management office and directors.”  On the basis of these findings, the
    application judge made an order restraining the appellant from:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>communicating
    with any employee of the management office or member of the Board of Directors,
    other than in writing; and </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>entering
    or coming within 25 feet of the respondent’s management office.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, she ordered that: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    appellant must request in writing any records of the respondent that he wishes
    to receive; he could not submit more than one request for the same record;
    and, if he did submit more than a single request, the respondent would not
    be required to provide a further response;  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    appellant must pay in advance the photocopying charges for any document he
    requested; and </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    appellant was not permitted to review any records in advance of a request
    for production.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge awarded the respondent costs in the amount of $30,000,
    and granted the respondent a further $15,000 as “additional actual costs” under
    s. 134(5) of the <i>Condominium Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant appeals from the application judge’s decision on the merits, as
    well as from her costs disposition.  The appellant advances several arguments.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the appellant submits that the Board of Directors of the respondent improperly
    refused to produce to him records that he had requested.  This submission,
    however, is not pertinent.  While the appellant has pointed to some evidence
    in the record that suggests that the Board of Directors was less than eager
    to fulfill its duty to produce records to him, the appellant did not bring
    a cross-application for relief against the respondent.  Thus, the only issue
    before application judge was the nature of the appellant’s conduct in pursuing
    disclosure from the respondent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the appellant argues that the application judge should not have resolved
    disputed facts and issues of credibility on a written record; instead, she
    should have ordered the trial of an issue.  In particular, the appellant
    submits that the application judge relied excessively on the affidavit evidence
    of two members of the respondent’s management staff about what were, according
    to the appellant, isolated events, without considering the contradictory
    or qualifying statements they made in cross-examination. He points out that
    she made no reference to his explanatory and contradictory evidence and submits
    she had no basis for rejecting it.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not accept this argument.  The appellant did not ask the application judge
    to order a trial of issues and there were enough undisputed facts to make
    an order on the application.  That said, we accept the submission of counsel
    for the respondent that the application judge did not intend to make a finding
    of actionable harassment.  Even taking account of the conflicts in the evidence,
    the record before the application judge made clear that the relationship
    between the appellant, on one side, and the respondent’s Board of Directors
    and management staff, on the other, was extremely strained.  That strained
    relationship, and the appellant’s contribution to it, provided a basis for
    an order regulating the manner in which he should exercise his rights under
    the <i>Condominium Act</i>.  On the record, such an order was justified and
    required to ensure the parties’
    relationship remained workable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    the appellant argued that the application judge could not eliminate entirely
    his statutory rights of access, which was a result of the injunctive relief.  He
    relies on s.&nbsp;55 (3) of the<i> Condominium Act</i>, which gives him the
    right to examine records of the corporation “reasonably related”
    to the purposes of the <i>Act</i>.  The section does contemplate that there
    be a written request made on reasonable notice and that the examination takes
    place at a reasonable time. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent submitted that s. 134(1) of the <i>Condominium Act</i> provides
    a basis for the injunctive relief granted by the application judge.  Section
    134(1) provides that the court may make “an order enforcing compliance” with
    any provision of the <i>Condominium Act</i>, the declaration, the by-laws,
    or the rules.  We do not need to decide the ambit of s. 134(1) or of a Superior
    Court judge’s inherent jurisdiction in order to dispose of this case.  On
    the particular facts of this case, the motion judge’s remedy, while is entitled
    to deference, is too extreme to be sustained.  Given the respondent’s acknowledgement
    that the appellant’s behaviour did not amount to actionable harassment, we
    were not persuaded that the orders made by the application judge prohibiting
    the appellant from exercising his statutory right to examine the respondent’s
    records, coming within 25 feet of its management office, or communicating
    with members of the Board of Directors or management staff other than in
    writing, were supportable.  Accordingly, we would set aside these injunctive
    aspects of the application judge’s order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    would leave in place the application judge’s orders that the appellant make
    his requests to examine documents or for copies thereof in writing, that
    he not make more than one request with respect to the same record, and that
    he pay in advance the reasonable photocopying charges of any copies of records
    that he requests.  As noted above, s. 55(3) requires that the appellant’s
    statutory right must be exercised reasonably.  In the first instance, it
    is for the respondent to decide what notice is reasonable and what is a reasonable
    time and place for the appellant to examine the records. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    would allow the appeal in part and set aside the injunctive components of
    the application judge’s order as discussed above and dismiss the remainder
    of the appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    agreed that the costs of the successful party on the appeal should be fixed
    in the amount of $30,000, inclusive of disbursements and GST.  Given the
    appellant’s partial success, costs of the appeal are fixed in his favour
    in the amount of $20,000, inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    result of the appeal changes the relative success of the parties on the application.  The
    costs of the application are varied and fixed in the amount of $20,000, inclusive
    of disbursements and GST, in favour of the respondent.  This amount includes
    the “additional actual costs” factor under s. 134(5) of the <i>Condominium
    Act</i>.</p>
