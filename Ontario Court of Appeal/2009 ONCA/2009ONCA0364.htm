  <h4><span lang=EN-US>A.        OVERVIEW</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    dispute in this appeal is whether and, if so, to what extent, losses due
    to an employee’s misconduct are covered by a fidelity insurance bond.  The
    question arises in the context of an appeal and cross-appeal from a decision
    on a motion for summary judgment involving a number of parties.  Summary
    judgment was granted in the main action against the appellants, Co-operators
    General Insurance Company and Cumis General Insurance Company (the “Insurers”),
    in favour of the respondent, Iroquois Falls Community Credit Union Limited
    (the
    “Credit Union”) under the fidelity insurance bond in the amount of approximately
    $1.8 million plus prejudgment interest.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Insurers had issued the fidelity insurance bond to the Credit Union.  The
    Deposit Insurance Corporation of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario (“DICO”), as liquidator of the Credit Union, made a claim under the
    bond for losses due to the alleged dishonest misconduct of Donna Simmons
    (“Simmons”), the general manager of the Credit Union, and others.  The Insurers
    commenced a subrogated third party action against the Credit Union’s auditors
    during the relevant period, Ross, Pope and Company, alleging that they failed
    to identify, at an early stage, the losses due to the alleged misconduct.  The
    third parties brought a fourth party claim against both the Credit Union’s
    directors and the Credit Union itself alleging contributory negligence.  As
    well, Simmons brought a fifth party claim against Cumis General Insurance
    Company claiming indemnity in respect of director and officer (“D&amp;O”)
    insurance coverage for her. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Only
    the Insurers and the third parties defended the Credit Union’s motion for
    summary judgment.  The fourth parties chose not to participate in the motion.  In
    granting summary judgment in favour of the Credit Union and against the Insurers,
    the motion judge stipulated that the judgment was binding only as between
    the Credit Union and the Insurers.  The motion judge reserved for trial the
    third, fourth, and fifth party claims.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Insurers’ appeal is a broad attack on the motion judge’s decision granting
    summary judgment.  They submit that the motion judge: should not have interpreted
    the bond; interpreted several provisions of the bond incorrectly; was not
    entitled to make the inferences of fact that he did; incorrectly determined
    factual issues; used the wrong approach in calculating the quantum of the
    loss; and, erred in holding that his findings applied only to the main action.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Credit Union argues strenuously that the Insurers failed to put their best
    foot forward in response to its summary judgment motion.  The Credit Union
    points out that it filed the detailed results of its massive forensic investigation
    in support of its motion.  The Insurers did not cross examine its expert
    forensic accountant and failed to file any substantive response to her conclusions.  The
    evidence of the directors and employees of the Credit Union was also available.
     The Credit Union submits that there would be no new evidence at trial and
    asserts that the motion judge was as well positioned as a trial judge to
    interpret the bond and apply it to the complete evidentiary record, which
    remains uncontested.  The Credit Union argues that instead of responding
    to its material, the Insurers have raised some 19 grounds of appeal relating
    primarily to the interpretation of the bond.  In addition, the Credit Union
    cross-appeals the motion judge’s denial of part of its claim on the basis
    that the bond’s exclusion for “Indirect Loss” applied. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite
    the Credit Union’s able argument, I would allow the appeal.  A summary judgment
    motion judge should refrain from deciding issues of fact where significant
    evidence, albeit uncontested, is reasonably capable of supporting more than
    one inference.  Here, the findings of fact that would determine whether two
    key conditions in the bond – the condition for
    “Termination as to an Individual” (“Termination”) and the condition for “Notice
    of Loss”, which are discussed later in these reasons – apply should be made
    at trial.  As well, whether the Credit Union’s claim under the bond should
    be assessed as a single loss resulting from a single “scheme”
    of employee misconduct, as inferred by the motion judge, or, as an assortment
    of individual losses resulting from different employee acts during the relevant
    period, should be decided at trial.  If it is determined that the Credit
    Union’s claim is properly treated as an assortment of losses that must be
    analyzed individually, or if the Condition for Termination is found to apply,
    the quantification of damages will also be a genuine issue for trial.  These
    conclusions dictate that the entire summary judgment be set aside. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I explain later, given my disposition of the appeal, I would regard the cross-appeal
    as moot.  As well, it is not necessary to deal with the position of the fourth
    parties that all the motion judge’s findings of fact and credibility concerning
    them do not bind them in the remaining third, fourth, and fifth party actions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not accept the Insurers’ submission that the motion judge should have
    left the interpretation of the bond to trial.  In determining whether there
    was a genuine issue for trial, the motion judge had to apply the bond to
    the uncontested facts before him.  Nor am I persuaded that this court, after
    deciding that the action should proceed to trial, should leave the bond to
    the trial judge to interpret on a full record.  The bond’s interpretation
    was hotly contested and the trial judge’s conclusions would likely be appealed
    to this court.  Deciding the contentious issues of the bond’s interpretation
    that are completely argued before us and will inevitably arise again at trial
    will contribute to the efficiency of the trial that must take place.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    my interpretation of the bond will make apparent, on the record before him
    the motion judge had ample evidence to decide some of the issues in favour
    of the Credit Union.  I discuss the interpretative issues in the context
    of the evidence in the motion record.  I should not be taken, however, as
    deciding factual issues.  As all the factual and interpretative issues are
    somewhat intertwined, it would be difficult to isolate the matters that can
    be finally decided on the evidence in the motion record.  Moreover, at trial,
    trying to settle what isolated matters this court has already decided could
    prove a difficult exercise.  It is better that all issues be allowed to go
    to trial.  My intent is to assist the trial judge with the task of applying
    the bond, without foreclosing any party from adducing evidence at trial made
    relevant to the application of the bond given the interpretation of the bond
    in these reasons.  It will be for the trial judge to decide the bond’s application
    to the evidence at trial in light of these reasons. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>B.        BACKGROUND AND RELEVANT FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Credit Union was established in the mid-1970s in the town of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Iroquois Falls in northern
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario.  At the time of the events in question on this appeal, the vast
    majority (80% – 90%) of the Credit Union’s members were current or former
    employees of Abitibi Consolidated (“Abitibi”), a pulp and paper company that
    was the main employer in the town.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the early 1980s, Abitibi started to scale back its operations significantly,
    which had a detrimental effect on the town’s local economy.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    around this time, Simmons started working at the Credit Union as a teller.  She
    later became the office administrator.  In 1987, she was promoted to general
    manager.  In this capacity, she was responsible for the overall operations
    of the Credit Union, including its lending activities.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    marked decline in the town’s local economy was reflected in the Credit Union’s
    weakening financial position.  By the early 1990s, many personal loans and
    mortgages extended by the Credit Union to its members had become under-secured
    as a result of worsening local economic conditions and the associated drop
    in local real estate values.  The incidence of bad loans and bankruptcy filings
    by Credit Union members increased into and continued throughout the 1990s.  It
    was in this deteriorating economic environment that the events relevant to
    this appeal arose. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    a report dated September 4, 1991, the Ministry of Financial Institutions
    found a number of deficiencies attaching to certain loans made by the Credit
    Union, including a number of loans in excess of the $25,000 limit authorized
    by the Credit Union’s by-laws, as well as unauthorized overdrafts and lines
    of credit.  The report also identified that the Credit Union was not in compliance
    with statutory financial reporting requirements.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    a report dated July 16, 1993, the Ministry of Finance, Credit Unions and
    Cooperative Services Branch found several contraventions of the Credit Union’s
    by-laws, including unauthorized overdrafts and other irregularities in its
    lending activities and financial reporting.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    late October 1996, a comprehensive examination of the Credit Union was conducted
    by the Credit Union Central of Ontario (“CUCO”).  In a report dated January
    24, 1997, the CUCO inspectors noted that the Credit Union’s allowance for
    impaired loans had not been established in accordance with the applicable
    provincial by-law.  The report also identified: incomplete application forms;
    inadequate credit investigations; lack of applications, effective credit
    investigations, and annual reviews of authorized overdrafts; and, other irregularities
    and deficiencies in control processes.  This report was forwarded to the
    Credit Union’s auditors.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Another
    report conducted by the Ministry of Finance, Credit Unions and Cooperative
    Services Branch dated March 18, 1999, found irregularities and deficiencies
    in the Credit Union’s internal controls, in particular, with respect to its
    lending activities, compliance obligations, and business practices.  The
    report specifically noted that the Credit Union’s allowance for impaired
    loans was still inadequate and failed to comply with the provincial by-law.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    September 2001, DICO discovered a significant asset shortage at the Credit
    Union.  Specifically, DICO became aware of a recent filing for bankruptcy
    by a member of the Credit Union that included the guarantee of unsecured
    indebtedness in the amount of approximately $750,000.  The outstanding indebtedness
    was owed by the member’s husband.  This led to a voluntary request by the
    Credit Union’s board of directors to be placed under the supervision of DICO.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    DICO took over supervision of the Credit Union, it identified, in addition
    to the $750,000 unsecured amount previously discovered: numerous unauthorized
    advances on lines of credit exceeding the board-approved limit of $5,000
    for loans secured by wage assignments; numerous other unauthorized overdrafts;

    that during the period from 1991 – 2001, Simmons, either alone or in collusion

  <h3>1.         Interpretation of the bond – the “Dishonesty” coverage clause</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The “Dishonesty” provision
    of the bond’s Insuring Agreement under which the Credit Union’s claim was
    made provides that the bond covers:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Direct loss of property resulting from dishonest
    or fraudulent acts of any employee, director or committee member, committed
    alone or in collusion with others with the manifest intent to:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span>1.<span

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Each
    of these requirements is analytically distinct from the other requirements.  All
    four requirements must be satisfied in order to trigger coverage under the
    bond.</p>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US>i.          Direct loss of property</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The “Dishonesty” provision
    of the Insuring Agreement provides that the bond insures only for “direct
    loss of property”.  Moreover, the bond contains an express exclusion for “Indirect
    Loss”, which states that the bond does not apply to “[i]ndirect or consequential
    loss or damage, loss of use or loss of earnings or interest on property.”  As
    I have already explained, the requirement that there be a “direct loss of
    property” is analytically distinct from the requirement that the dishonest
    employee have the manifest intent to cause such a loss.  I deal in this section
    only with the Insurers’ argument that the record before the motion judge
    did not establish that the Credit Union had suffered direct losses.  I discuss
    in the next section the issue of whether Simmons had the manifest intent
    to cause the losses.  </p>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US>a) Money taken from treasury</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first argument advanced by the Insurers in this regard is that the Credit
    Union sustained no loss because “no money went out the door”.  Simmons explained
    that she applied the money she took from the Credit Union’s treasury to service
    impaired loans and overdrafts so that the Credit Union would not attract
    regulatory scrutiny and to prevent the members’ accounts from going into
    default.  According to the Insurers, the money that Simmons took from the
    treasury, in effect, was simply transferred internally within the Credit
    Union from one accounting heading in its books to another.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is important to remember that this category involves the unauthorized physical
    removal of cash from the Credit Union’s vault.  Simmons admitted to physically
    removing cash from the Credit Union’s vault in large amounts, keeping it
    in her bottom drawer, and using it to make deposits in smaller amounts to
    members’ checking accounts from time-to-time to service their impaired loans
    and overdrafts.  She said that her practice was to make up a deposit slip
    and give both the slip and the cash to a teller to deposit into the members’ accounts.  She
    said that she made a fictitious journal voucher each time she took money
    from the vault. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    cannot accept the Insurers’ characterization of Simmons’
    acts as merely transferring funds internally between the Credit Union’s accounts.  There
    was both a physical removal of cash from the vault and a deposit of actual
    cash in the members’
    accounts.  The Insurers’ submission attempts to meld these two separate and
    independent transactions into one.  It fails to recognize that the first
    transaction was complete at the moment that Simmons walked out of the vault
    with the unauthorized cash.  The Credit Union suffered a direct loss to its
    cash position from that transaction in much the same way that the King sustains
    a direct loss when robbed by Robin Hood, even though Robin Hood later gives
    the money to peasants to pay their taxes to the King. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    reasoning is consistent with that of Arbour J. in <i>Tricontinental Investments
    Co. v. Guarantee Co. of North America </i>(1988), 30 C.C.L.I. 33 (Ont. H.C.),
    one of the two
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario cases cited to the court regarding the bond’s interpretation.  In <i>Tricontinental, </i>the
    malefactor diverted money held on behalf of Tricontinental Investment Company
    (“TIC”) in the account of Tricontinental Investments Limited (“TIL”) to the
    account of Tricontinental Chemical Company (“TCC”), a company which he controlled,
    to use in trading with the hope of generating a profit and repaying the “borrowed” money.  However,
    trading losses prevented him from doing so.  Arbour J. stated at p. 41 that: “[i]t
    is important to recognize that TIC suffered the above mentioned loss as soon
    as the funds left the TIL Chase account and were received by an unentitled
    recipient.”  She reasoned that the trading losses of TCC did not constitute
    the loss of TIC but continued it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the same vein, the Credit Union would suffer<i> </i>a direct loss of money
    immediately upon the unauthorized removal of cash from its vault.  Simmons’ subsequent
    act of depositing the money into members’ accounts may be relevant to establishing
    that she had the manifest intent to obtain a financial benefit for another
    person but is not relevant here. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    it is not necessary to continue the analysis, I add that counsel for the
    Insurers recognized that the use of the Credit Union’s own money to pay down
    a member’s indebtedness would reduce the value of its account receivable
    without a corresponding receipt.  He argued, however, that this reduction
    was both artificial and temporary.  It was artificial because it was only
    an accounting entry and no true payment had been made on account.  It was
    temporary because once Simmons’ misconduct was discovered the Credit Union
    could simply reverse the deposit, restore the receivable to its true value,
    and collect the money from the member whose account had been credited. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not accept this argument.  As I have already discussed, the Credit Union
    sustains a loss when cash is improperly removed from its vault.  The subsequent
    reversal of an improper reduction in the value of the Credit Union’s account
    receivable would simply be an attempt to recover a direct loss that had already
    been sustained.  It seems to me that the Insurers fail to distinguish between
    whether there is a “direct loss”, which is but one requirement to trigger
    coverage, with whether the loss, once established, can be recovered, which
    is a question of damages.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Insurers persisted with their “no money out the door” theory, arguing that
    it applies at least where Simmons deposited money she took from treasury
    into the accounts of members who were never going to be able to repay any
    of their indebtedness in any event.  However, the evidence in the motion
    record indicated that at the time Simmons claims to have made payments towards
    the members’
    indebtedness, their indebtedness had not been written off and would have
    been on the Credit Union’s books as an asset, the reduction of which constituted
    a direct loss to the Credit Union.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    evidence before the motion judge would provide the basis for concluding that
    the Credit Union suffered a direct loss the moment there was an unauthorized
    removal of cash from its vault. </p>
  <h4><i><span
lang=EN-US>b) Unauthorized overdrafts and loans</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Insurers argue that the Credit Union did not suffer a direct loss as a result
    of the extension of unauthorized loans to actual people who had real obligations
    to repay the money they received.  The Insurers distinguish this situation
    from one where a financial institution manager makes a fictitious loan to
    a nonexistent person as a means of defrauding the institution.  In that situation,
    they recognize that the financial institution would suffer a direct loss
    of the money paid out on the fictitious loan.  Here, however, they argue
    that there is no immediate direct loss because the money is recoverable from
    the real person who received the unauthorized loan.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    example does not support the Insurers’ position because the two situations
    are not as different as they might first seem.  Both situations involve loans
    made on the basis of fictitious information and the effect of both transactions
    on the assets of the financial institution is exactly the same.  In both
    situations, the institution has the right to recover the money from the person
    who received it. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the same vein, I do not see a meaningful distinction between the situation
    where a bank employee colludes with an unqualified debtor and, in return
    for a kickback, loans the bank’s money for worthless collateral, and the
    situation where a bank employee who, out of sympathy, makes the same loan
    on the same worthless collateral to help the debtor out.  Although the employee’s
    motivation is arguably relevant to the issue of “manifest intent”, the impact
    on the bank’s assets is exactly the same in the two situations.  If one is
    satisfied that the bank suffers a direct loss from the extending of the bad
    loan in the first situation, one must also conclude that there is a direct
    loss from extending the bad loan in the second situation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Examples
    aside, the Insurers’ reasoning is flawed because it fails to focus on what
    results directly from the employee’s dishonest or fraudulent act.  Instead,
    the Insurers seek to place the focus on what happens or, what the employee
    hopes will happen, later on.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    direct result of Simmons dishonestly presenting loan applications containing
    false information to the loan committee for approval is that the Credit Union
    parted with money it otherwise would have kept, thereby sustaining a reduction
    of its cash on hand.  Evidence of such action would support the finding that
    the Credit Union sustained a direct loss – it paid out money that it would
    not otherwise have paid and so ended up with less money.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    erroneously focusing on the Credit Union’s ability to attempt to collect
    the money later, the Insurers confuse the issue of whether there is a direct
    loss with the issue of whether the direct loss can be recovered.  At this
    stage of the analysis, we are concerned only with the requirements to trigger
    the coverage clause.  Ultimately, whether a particular exclusion applies
    and the quantification of the damages suffered are questions for later determination,
    should they arise.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    are additional flaws in the Insurers’
    argument.  First, the Insurers’ argument is logical only in the abstract.  Abstractly,
    the Credit Union can always seek repayment of an unauthorized loan until
    it cannot be repaid.  However, the Insurers offered no criterion for concluding
    when an unauthorized loan will not be repaid.  Whether the loans might be
    repaid must be considered not as an abstraction, but on the facts contained
    in the record before the motion judge.  The only evidence on the record in
    this case is that the loans satisfied the objective criteria as to be considered
    impaired and that their collection was doubtful.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>DICO,

    Ontario credit unions.  In its By-law No. 6, DICO has established rules,

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    evidence of the Credit Union’s forensic accounting investigator, Ms. McKenzie,
    was uncontradicted.  According to her report dated November 7, 2001, the
    Credit Union’s allowance for impaired loans did not meet the requirements
    of DICO’s By-law No. 6 as at August 31, 2001, at which time its allowance
    for impaired loans required a minimum adjustment of approximately $1.8 million
    to comply with the By-law.  As at August 31, 2001, the amount of unsecured
    and unauthorized overdrafts and lines of credit stood at $1,691,874.  Under
    By-law No. 6, this amount should have been added to the Credit Union’s allowance
    for impaired loans on its balance sheet and, more importantly, recorded as
    a charge against income on its income statement.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    the matter is considered, not abstractly but on the record, there can be
    no doubt that the value of the Credit Union’s accounts receivable was diminished
    significantly.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the observation that the Credit Union may be able to recover the unauthorized
    loans is simply not helpful to the analysis.  The consequence of unfortunately
    having suffered an illegitimate loss is having the right to recover it.  The
    question is not whether the loss can be recovered but, rather, whether it
    is insured under the bond.  The bond confirms this distinction by providing
    that upon payment of a loss, the insurer shall be subrogated to the rights
    of the insured to recover the loss.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the record before the motion judge, there was ample evidence to support the
    conclusion that the advance of money by allowing unauthorized overdrafts
    or extending unauthorized loans resulted in a direct loss to the Credit Union.  The
    market value of its loan portfolio was reduced and, according to regulatory
    criteria, there was a negative impact on its balance sheet and income statement. </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The “Dishonesty” provision
    of the Insuring Agreement requires that the direct loss that is sustained
    be the result of “dishonest or fraudulent acts of any employee”.  First,
    it must be found that an employee committed dishonest or fraudulent acts.  Second,
    it must be found that the direct loss was a result of those acts.  In this
    section, I conclude that the uncontested admissions support the motion judge’s
    finding that there were dishonest acts that resulted in loss within the meaning
    of the bond.  The quantification of that loss, however, is a different question.  As
    I explain below, whether the dishonest acts of Simmons and the other employees
    were part of a single scheme is a genuine issue for trial.  If it is decided
    at trial that each loss on each account must be assessed separately or in
    smaller groupings, it would be open to the Insurers to dispute the characterization
    of a particular act as dishonest causing loss.   </p>
  <h4><i><span
lang=EN-US>a) Dishonest acts  </span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    their factum, the Insurers contest the motion judge’s finding that “Simmons
    and the colluding employees admitted their dishonest acts”.  While they concede
    that Simmons and other employees admitted misconduct, they argue that whether
    such misconduct should be characterized as dishonest within the meaning of
    the bond is a matter for trial.  While counsel for the Insurers may not have
    conceded the point, in oral argument he did not vigorously challenge that
    the admitted acts were dishonest. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    bond does not define “dishonesty”.  However, in the ordinary sense of the
    word, a great many of Simmons’ acts cannot be characterized as anything other
    than dishonest.  Simmons, for example, admitted creating, executing, and
    authorizing false or fictitious documents, entries and postings into the
    Credit Union’s books, records, and computer system.  Making fictitious entries
    is dishonest.  The act of accessing the Credit Union’s computer system to
    enter a number to indicate a false inflated pre-authorized overdraft limit
    is capable of being characterized as forgery.  Secretly taking money out
    of the vault without authorization is dishonest.  </p>
  <h4><i><span
lang=EN-US>b) Loss resulting from dishonest acts</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    dishonest removal of cash from the Credit Union’s vault resulted in the Credit
    Union sustaining a direct loss immediately, as explained above.  It is not
    necessary to discuss further the cash taken from the vault.  I discuss only
    the extension of unauthorized credit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Simmons
    made dishonest fictitious entries both to facilitate and to conceal the extension
    of unauthorized credit.  The Insurers argue that dishonest acts to conceal
    the default of legitimately extended credit must be distinguished from dishonest
    acts that prompted the Credit Union to extend credit that it would not have
    authorized otherwise.  According to the Insurers, a dishonest act of concealment
    cannot operate retroactively to make a loss that arose from a properly authorized
    extension of credit a loss resulting from dishonesty.  For example, the Insurers
    say that in many instances members failed to make payments on properly authorized
    overdrafts and the outstanding balance increased because of the accumulation
    of interest and service charges.  Simmons then increased the “authorized
    limit”
    on the Credit Union’s computer system to accommodate the accruing interest
    and service charges and to keep the loans from defaulting.  In these situations,
    there was no fresh advance of funds.  The Insurers submit that Simmons’ acts
    of merely concealing indebtedness, even if dishonest, cannot be said to have
    caused the loss of the total amount of the indebtedness at the end of the
    day.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Insurers point out that the motion judge avoided confronting this argument
    by taking the all-embracing view that all the dishonest acts of Simmons and
    the other employees were all part of a single collusive scheme.  This enabled
    the motion judge to conclude that the Credit Union’s claim, in the aggregate,
    resulted from dishonesty.  The Insurers argue that Simmons and the other
    employees did not admit that they acted in a collusive scheme; they admitted
    to individual acts and decisions made over the years in relation to different
    members and their accounts.  The motion judge, they submit, should not have
    made on a motion for summary judgment the finding of fact that there was
    a single collusive scheme.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree.  Given its potential bearing on the analysis of both liability and
    damages, the finding of fact that all the dishonest acts were part of one
    scheme should not have been made on a summary judgment motion.  On a summary
    judgment motion, where significant evidence, albeit uncontested, is reasonably
    capable of supporting more than one inference, the motion judge should refrain
    from deciding the issue of fact.  The competing inferences should be resolved
    at trial: see <i>Transamerica Occidental Life Insurance Co. v. Toronto-Dominion
    Bank</i> (1999), 44 O.R. (3d) 97 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    finding merit in this argument, I should not be taken to express a view as
    to whether there was or was not a single scheme.  Whether there was a scheme,
    or an assortment of individual acts, or a number of smaller schemes, should
    be decided at trial.  The trial judge can consider, among other things, whether
    the act of concealing the default of properly extended credit, while not
    causing a loss on that particular indebtedness, may have allowed the employee’s
    loss-causing activities in general to remain undetected and so to continue.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether
    Simmons’ acts are analyzed as a single scheme or as separate acts is a genuine
    issue for trial that could make a difference to the total amount of the claimed
    loss awarded.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    should note that the original principal amount of properly authorized overdrafts
    was not included in the Credit Union’s claim and the motion judge deducted
    $200,000 from the total amount claimed because he concluded that the accumulated
    interest and service charges were excluded under the bond as a loss of earnings
    or interest.  However, as the Credit Union’s entire claim is being sent on
    for trial, the questions of whether these amounts result from dishonest acts,
    and whether they should be characterized as accumulated interest or a fresh
    advance of funds, remain live issues for trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    summary on this issue, the uncontested record supports the motion judge’s
    conclusion<i> </i>that there were employee acts of dishonesty that resulted
    in direct loss.  The removal of cash from the vault and the making of fictitious
    entries to facilitate extending unauthorized credit resulted in direct loss
    within the meaning of the bond.  There is a genuine issue as to whether the
    acts that gave rise to the claim should be assessed individually or as part
    of one scheme or a series of schemes.  The resolution of this genuine issue
    may affect the extent to which the amounts claimed by the Credit Union can
    all be said to be the result of dishonest acts.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    next interpretative issue is whether Simmons had a
    “manifest intent” to cause the loss, the third requirement under the
    “Dishonesty” coverage provision of the bond.  The Insurers saw this as the “real
    battleground” of the interpretation of the bond. </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the Insurers point out, the words “with the manifest intent to cause…loss” in
    the coverage clause indicate that not all losses resulting from dishonesty
    are insured.  The bond insures only against losses that result from dishonest
    acts done with the manifest intent to cause loss.  The bond does not insure
    losses due to dishonesty where the employee did not have the manifest intent
    to cause the loss.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Insurers rely on Simmons’ evidence that she did not intend to cause loss
    to the Credit Union.  The Insurers urge that Simmons’ intent must be assessed
    in the context that
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">

    <st1:PlaceType

    Falls was a “one industry” town and that one industry was declining.  Local
    residents were getting into serious financial trouble due to repeated strikes
    and layoffs.  The Credit Union was not an ordinary commercial bank; it was
    a creature of the community run by community members.  Its staff, including
    Simmons, were not particularly well trained in finance and accounting.  According
    to the Insurers, when viewed in this context, Simmons’ intent was to help
    members in difficult times and to keep DICO, the regulator, from taking over
    the Credit Union and perhaps closing it down.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Insurers argue that Simmons did not have the manifest intent to cause loss
    or, at least, that whether she had such an intent is a genuine issue for
    trial.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    starting point in interpreting the bond is a consideration of the text of
    the bond.  The first step in interpreting insurance contracts, like all contracts,
    is to attempt to give effect to the intention of the parties gathered from
    the words they have used: <i>Consolidated-Bathurst Export Ltd. v. Mutual
    Boiler and Machinery Insurance Co.</i>, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 888, at p. 899, citing <i>Pense
    v. Northern Life Insurance Co.</i> (1907), 15 O.L.R. 131 (C.A.), at p. 137,
    aff'd (1908), 42 S.C.R. 246.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is necessary to consider the words “manifest intent”
    within their setting in the bond.  What meaning is attached to the words
    in other contexts is of limited assistance.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    first observe that the phrase “manifest intent” is part of a coverage clause.  It
    is established that coverage provisions in insurance policies should be construed
    broadly and exclusion clauses narrowly, as noted by Estey J. in <i>Consolidated
    Bathurst Export Ltd. </i>at p. 899:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Insurance contracts and the interpretative difficulties
    arising therein have been before courts for at least two centuries, and it
    is trite to say that where an ambiguity is found to exist in the terminology
    employed in the contract, such terminology shall be construed against the
    insurance carrier as being the author, or at least the party in control of
    the contents of the contract. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    there is any ambiguity about the meaning of
    “manifest intent”, it must be resolved in favour of the insured. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the “manifest intent” the parties had in mind in crafting the bond is the
    intent to cause a direct loss of property that results from dishonest or
    fraudulent acts of the employee.  This is crucially important because a person
    may harbour more than one intent at the same time.  A person may intend to
    achieve a final goal by intending to accomplish some interim steps along
    the way.  The words of the bond do not indicate that an intent to cause loss
    in accomplishing an interim step in a greater plan will not suffice.  The
    words of the bond do not indicate that only the intended outcome of the greater
    plan must be considered.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the language of the bond set out above indicates that the focus
    must be on the employee’s intent in doing the act that caused the loss.  If
    the act that caused the loss was an interim step in a greater plan, it is
    the intended result of the interim step that must be considered.  Where the
    act that caused the loss was an interim step in a greater plan, subsequent
    acts taken or planned by the employee are quite irrelevant.  If there is
    any ambiguity in this, and I see none, it must be resolved in favour of the
    insured. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    it is of central importance that the word
    “intent” does not stand alone but, rather, is modified by the word “manifest”.  The <i>Canadian
    Oxford</i> <i>Dictionary</i>, 2d ed., <i>s.v. </i>“manifest”, provides the
    following meaning for the adjective “manifest”: clear or obvious to the eye
    or mind.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Many
    American courts have found the meaning of the modifier “manifest” significant
    in understanding the bond’s requirement of
    “intent”.  In <i>Auto Lenders Acceptance Corp. </i>(2004), 854 A.2d 378,<i> </i>the
    Supreme Court of New Jersey, after setting out dictionary definitions of
    the word, stated at p.&nbsp;393 that
    “manifest” means that the employee’s intent must be “apparent or obvious”.  The
    court then posed the rhetorical question
    – “[t]he use of this word thus begs the question: to whom must the employee’s
    intent be apparent or obvious?”  The court adopted the observation in <i>Hanson
    PLC v. Nat’l Fire Ins. Co. of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Pittsburgh</i> (1990), 794 P.2d 66 (Wash. App.), at p. 72, that “[a] secret
    intent is of no consequence” because manifest intent must be apparent or
    obvious.  The court also cited <i>Black’s Law Dictionary</i>, 7th ed., <i>s.v. </i>“intent”,
    which defines manifest intent as “[i]ntent that is apparent or obvious based
    on the available circumstantial evidence, even if direct evidence of intent
    is not available.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is clear that the text of the bond, by including the modifier “manifest”,
    requires that the employee’s intent to cause loss be clear or obvious or
    show itself plainly.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    two
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario decisions cited by the motion judge are consistent with this approach: <i>MacNab
    Auto Sales Ltd. v. Sun Alliance Insurance Co.</i> <span lang=FR-CA>(1998),
    1 C.C.L.I. (3d) 301 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    ), aff’g [1995] O.J. No. 600 (Ont. </span>Gen. Div.), and <i>Tricontinental</i>.  In <i>MacNab</i> at.
    p. 303, this court drew a distinction between the employee’s “intent” and
    his “desire”.  What the court called “desire” may be characterized as the
    employee’s intent to achieve an ultimate outcome.  The employee’s “intent” pertained
    to the immediate loss he caused.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Tricontinental</i>,
    the malefactor diverted money that belonged to one company, TIC, to the account
    of a company he controlled himself, so that he could use the funds in his
    trading activity.  In disposing of the notion that the malefactor did not
    have the requisite manifest intent to cause a loss, Arbour J. dismissed as
    irrelevant his “hope” that the account would eventually show a profit and
    enable him to repay the money.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is interesting that neither of the trial judges in these two cases cited
    dictionary definitions of the word “manifest”.  Still, they approached the
    phrase “manifest intent” in the manner I suggest.  In <i>MacNab</i>, Misener
    J. said that the employee’s intent was “plain and obvious”.  In <i>Tricontinental</i>,
    Arbour J. said the malefactor’s intent was “apparent”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[83]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Insurers submit that the motion judge misunderstood <i>MacNab</i>.  They
    rely on the court’s use of the words
    “consciously aware” to submit that <i>MacNab</i> sets a “stringent subjective
    intent standard” for the meaning of “manifest intent”.  The words are part
    of the statement of Misener J. at para. 43, of which this court approved:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Assuming that [the employee], through some process
    of reasoning, fervently wished that [his employer] would not suffer a loss,
    the evidence here demonstrates nevertheless that [the employee] was <i>consciously

    End never intended to pay for</i>, and that the total number delivered over
    on that basis was a steadily increasing one. [The employee] acknowledged
    all of that in his own testimony. <i>Intention is not to be confused with
    desire, and indeed it may be inimical to it. Consequences are intended when
    there is a conscious awareness that they are the certain result of one's
    actions</i>. [The employee] knew that a loss to [the employer] was the certain
    result of his actions and yet he continued their pursuit. It follows, therefore,
    that [the employee’s] plain and obvious intention was to cause [the employer]
    to sustain the loss for which it now claims. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[84]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    draw two things from these remarks.  First, the passage makes clear that
    an employee’s “fervent wish” or “desire” for a particular ultimate outcome
    was irrelevant.  Second, the employee’s “manifest intent” could be inferred
    from his “conscious awareness” of what he was doing and his knowledge of
    the certain consequences of his acts.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not read the reasoning of Misener J., or the reasons of this court upholding
    it, as requiring knowledge that the consequences of an act are certain in
    order to infer “manifest intent”.  <i>McNab</i> simply decided that knowledge
    of certain results was sufficient to infer manifest intent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    care must be taken in resorting to other areas of the law, I note that in
    criminal law a person’s knowledge of the substantially certain consequences
    of an act is sufficient to establish a person’s intent: see <i>R. v. Keegstra</i>,
    [1990] 3 S.C.R. 697, at pp. 774 – 775, and <i>R. v. Buzzanga</i> (1979),
    25 O.R. (2d) 705 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), at pp. 720 – 721.  In <i>Buzzanga</i>, Martin J.A. stated at p. 720 that: “as
    a general rule, a person who foresees that a consequence is certain or substantially
    certain to result from an act which he does in order to achieve some other
    purpose, intends that consequence.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    see no reason why a more demanding approach should be taken under the bond,
    which does not require proof beyond a reasonable doubt.  In my view, the
    employee’s “manifest intent” under the bond may be established by the employee’s
    admission as to his or her intent, or by evidence which establishes that
    he or she knew or was substantially certain that loss would be the consequence
    of the dishonest act.  Knowledge may be proved by admissions, circumstantial
    evidence, or a combination of the two. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No
    matter what evidence is used, the focus of the analysis should be placed
    on the employee’s intent in performing the very act that caused the loss,
    and not on some act the employee performs or plans to perform later.  Doing
    so makes the analysis both clearer and simpler.  This case is a good example.  </p>
  <h4><i><span
lang=EN-US>a) Manifest intent re money taken from treasury</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite
    Simmons’ stated long-term intent to help members in difficult times and to
    keep the regulator from taking over the Credit Union, she acknowledged acting
    with deliberation in taking money from the vault that she knew she was not
    authorized to take.  She also admitted to “purposely” falsifying documentation
    in order to conceal the cash taken.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first direct loss I have discussed is the unauthorized removal of cash from
    the Credit Union’s vault.  It is Simmons’ intent in removing the cash from
    the vault without authorization that must be considered in applying the bond.  Her
    statements in the record about what she intended to accomplish in the longer
    term and her subsequent acts can coexist with, but do not negate, her immediate
    intent in removing the cash.</p>
  <h4><i><span
lang=EN-US>b) Manifest intent re unauthorized extensions of credit</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Simmons
    did say that she honestly believed that the overdrafts and unauthorized loans
    would be repaid by the members.  She swore that she had no intent to cause
    the Credit Union to sustain a loss.  She said that in some instances, when
    a loan began to sour, she exercised her judgment to work with the member
    with a view to payment in the future rather than initiating collection procedures
    or writing off the loan as bad debt.  The Insurers submit that this testimony
    leads to the conclusion that there is, at the very least, a genuine issue
    for trial as to whether Simmons had the manifest intent to cause direct loss
    to the Credit Union.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    complete the picture of Simmons’ testimony painted by the Insurers, I add
    that she also admitted that she knew what level of risk tolerance the Credit
    Union was prepared to take and that she “unilaterally went beyond that risk
    tolerance” in granting unauthorized overdrafts and related extensions of
    credit.  In other words, she knew that she was giving out the Credit Union’s
    money on terms it did not wish to lend.  Further, she admitted that she had
    no basis for her hope that members would repay the money.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[93]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this context, I have discussed that the direct loss sustained by the Credit
    Union is the extending of money that it otherwise would have kept on hand.  In
    applying the bond, it is Simmons’ intent at the moment she extended the unauthorized
    credit that must be considered.  Her hopes or her intended ultimate outcome
    do not negate what she intended to achieve immediately in extending the credit.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[94]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    explained in the section on “Loss resulting from dishonest acts”, if the
    acts of Simmons and the other employees are not regarded as one collusive
    scheme, it may be open to the Insurers to argue that in doing a particular
    dishonest act (e.g. concealing rather than facilitating the extending of
    impaired credit), the employee acted without the manifest intent to cause
    loss.    </p>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US>iv.        Manifest intent to obtain financial benefit
        for oneself or others</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[95]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the evidence in the record, the motion judge had an ample basis for finding
    that Simmons had the manifest intent to obtain a financial benefit for herself
    or for others.  Not only did Simmons derive a personal benefit from some
    of her misconduct, but a major plank of the Insurers’ position is that her
    acts were intended to benefit some individual members of the Credit Union.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[96]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    completes my discussion of the coverage provision for “Dishonesty” in the
    Insuring Agreement.  I turn now to the exclusions and conditions of the bond.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>2.         Interpretation of the bond – exclusions and
      conditions</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[97]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    bond has provisions titled “Exclusions” and others titled “Conditions”.  Two
    conditions dictate that the appeal must be allowed.  These are the condition
    for “Termination” and the condition for “Notice of Loss”.  I begin by considering
    these conditions because whether they apply is a genuine issue for trial.</p>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US>i.          Condition for “Termination” </span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[98]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    condition for “Termination”, which has a much broader application than the
    condition for “Notice of Loss”, provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This Bond shall not apply to any subsequent loss
    caused by an EMPLOYEE…:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    soon as the INSURED, any DIRECTOR or the most senior management position,
    not in collusion with such person learns:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>a)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Of any fraudulent
    or dishonest act committed by such person at any time, whether in the employment
    of the INSURED or otherwise, whether or not of the type covered under Insuring
    Agreement “Dishonesty”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[99]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    language used in the condition for “Termination” is very broad.  It would
    appear to apply to knowledge of dishonest acts that may have been committed
    before the employee entered the insured’s employ, in relationships other
    than employment, and that may not have resulted in the type of loss insured
    under the bond.  However, it is not necessary to ponder the extent of its
    ambit in this case as the Insurers seek to apply it to Simmons’
    acts while in the employ of the Credit Union.  Certainly, the condition makes
    apparent the Insurers’ unwillingness to underwrite the risk posed by the
    insured keeping on its staff employees that it knows have acted dishonestly.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[100]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    stated, a dishonest act that satisfies the condition for “Termination” need
    not meet the Insuring Agreement’s requirements – i.e. the dishonest act need
    not result in direct loss or be committed with the manifest intent to cause
    a direct loss.  Turning things around, I see no reason why what is relied
    upon under the Insuring Agreement as a “fraudulent or dishonest act” should
    not also be recognized as a
    “fraudulent or dishonest act” under the condition for “Termination”.  For
    example, if making a false entry in the Credit Union’s computer system to
    permit an unauthorized overdraft limit is characterized as dishonest forgery
    for the purpose of the Insuring Agreement, then the Insurers may rely on
    the prior knowledge of such an act to trigger the application of the condition
    for “Termination”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[101]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    outside inspection reports to the Credit Union between 1991 and 1999 identified
    unauthorized overdrafts as well as other lending activity irregularities
    and financial reporting compliance issues.  Specifically, irregularities
    were identified in these reports in relation to some member accounts that
    form part of the claim for loss under the bond.  There is evidence to suggest
    that, at least at one point, Simmons could offer no explanation for some
    of the unauthorized overdrafts.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[102]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the outside inspection reports raise the question of whether the
    Credit Union learned that Simmons had committed dishonest acts prior to some
    of the losses and, if so, when.  If the Credit Union learned of her dishonesty
    before some or all the losses claimed were sustained, the condition for “Termination”
    would apply.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge did not set out the condition for “Termination”
    in his reasons.  He did deal with the inspection reports in the context of
    the condition for “Notice of Loss”, and he may have intended that analysis
    to apply to this condition as well.  In that analysis, the motion judge did
    not consider whether the Credit Union learned through the inspection reports
    whether Simmons had committed dishonest acts prior to some of the losses
    and, if so, when. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[104]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    question of whether the condition for “Termination”
    applies on the facts of this case raises a genuine issue for trial.  The
    result is that the entire summary judgment must be set aside, as there is
    no breakdown of the losses claimed into the time periods before and after
    the receipt of the various outside inspection reports.</p>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US>ii.         Condition for “Notice of Loss”</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[105]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    condition for “Notice of Loss” provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The INSURED shall file with the Insurer:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>      1.   A written notice of loss within 20 days
    after DISCOVERY OF LOSS</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>      2.   An itemized Proof of Loss, duly sworn,
    within 120 days after giving such notice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[106]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge analyzed the content of the outside inspection reports in finding
    that the Credit Union had met its obligation to file a written notice of
    loss within 20 days of “discovery of [the] loss”, which is defined in the
    bond using a reasonableness standard as:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>When the insured becomes aware of facts which would
    cause a reasonable person to conclude that a loss covered by this Bond has
    been or will be incurred, even though the exact amount or details of loss
    may not then be known.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This includes notice from a third party to the
    INSURED of an actual or potential claim alleging circumstances which, if
    established, would constitute a loss under this Bond. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    a defined term in the bond, this definition is incorporated into the condition
    for “Notice of Loss”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge, relying on the decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal
    in <i>Grindrod</i> <i>&amp; District Credit Union v. Cumis Insurance Society
    Inc. </i>(1985), 10 C.C.L.I. 39, observed that “mere knowledge by the board
    from time to time of the existence of overdrafts is insufficient to put a
    credit union on notice of criminal conduct.”  Criminal conduct is too high
    a standard.  The motion judge erred by applying this high standard.  The
    issue is simply whether the outside inspection reports would have alerted
    a reasonable person that a loss covered by the bond had been or would be
    incurred.  It was not necessary for the Credit Union to be put on notice
    of criminal conduct.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge assessed the inspection reports.  He considered them serially,
    and did not consider their cumulative effect.  He did not ask what a reasonable
    person would gather from the repeated findings of irregularities in the outside
    inspection reports.  I do not identify this as an error because deciding
    what the reports might have prompted in the mind of a reasonable person involves
    the weighing of evidence and the making of inferences where more than one
    inference is available on the evidence.  The question should not be decided
    on a summary judgment motion.  It is a genuine issue for trial.<i> </i></p>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US>iii</span></i><span
lang=EN-US>.       <i>Exclusion for “Loans and Overdrafts”</i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    bond excludes coverage for losses due to non-payment of or defaults on loans
    and extensions of credit or on overdrafts, “whether procured in good faith
    or through trick, artifice, fraud or false pretences, except when covered
    under the Insuring Agreements “Dishonesty” or “Forgery”.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    exclusion does not apply to losses covered under the “Dishonesty” coverage
    clause of the Insuring Agreement.  Therefore, it would not apply to either
    the unauthorized removal of cash from the Credit Union’s vault or to the
    losses due to unauthorized lending activity, to the extent they result from
    Simmons’ dishonest and manifestly intended actions.  As discussed above,
    such losses are covered under the “Dishonesty” coverage clause of the Insuring
    Agreement. </p>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US>iv.        Exclusion for “Unfaithful Performance”</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[112]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    exclusion for “Unfaithful Performance” provides that the bond does not apply
    to losses due to an employee’s “[f]ailure to faithfully perform duties, including
    but not limited to any deliberate or intentional act or omission in disregard
    of statutes, bylaws, regulations, lawful rules or instructions governing
    or directing the performance of duties.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[113]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unlike
    several other exclusions in the bond, this exclusion does not contain the
    exception for what is covered under the “Dishonesty”
    clause of the Insuring Agreement. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[114]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Insurers submit in their factum that this exclusion
    “is geared towards deliberate or intentional violations of statutes, regulations
    and employers’ instructions, albeit those committed <i>without</i> the manifest
    intent to cause the insured a loss” and “is aimed at acts, <i>including</i> dishonest
    acts, which are committed <i>without</i> manifest intent to cause the insured
    a loss” (emphasis in original).  Put simply, the exclusion provides that
    the bond does not cover the unfaithful performance of duties that may involve
    dishonest acts that cause loss but which are done without the manifest intent
    to cause loss.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    this interpretation, this exclusion has only limited application to this
    case.  Simmons acted with manifest intent to cause loss in removing money
    from the vault and in advancing money on unauthorized overdrafts and loans.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[116]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    exclusion may potentially apply, however, where no new money was actually
    paid out to the debtor and the claim is that accumulated interest and service
    charges were “capitalized” by an increase of the credit limit.  There is
    a genuine issue for trial as to whether the exclusion applies in respect
    of such claims. </p>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US>v.         Exclusion for “Indirect Loss” </span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    bond contains an exclusion for “Indirect Loss”, which provides that the bond
    does not apply to loss due to:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Indirect or consequential loss or damage, loss
    of use or loss of earnings or interest on PROPERTY.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[118]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge found that this provision was unambiguous.  He noted that the
    bond was intended to insure the Credit Union’s “property”, defined under
    the bond as
    “money, securities, non-negotiables, gems, jewelry, precious metal, and other
    similar tangible items.”  He said that in this case, the property insured
    under the bond was “money or credit accounts that allow access to money.”  He
    concluded that interest or service charges simply represented profit to the
    Credit Union and were therefore not recoverable under the bond.  He accepted
    the Insurers’ submission that those interest and service charges amounted
    to approximately $200,000 and reduced the Credit Union’s claim by that amount.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[119]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Credit Union cross-appeals the motion judge’s reduction by $200,000 of the
    amount granted on summary judgment.  However, the reduction ceases to exist
    once the summary judgment is set aside.  The cross-appeal becomes moot.  Accordingly,
    the application of the exclusion for “Indirect Loss” to the claim in this
    case will be a live issue at trial.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>E.        CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[120]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge erred by granting summary judgment in this case.  Whether the
    acts of Simmons and the other employees were part of one collusive scheme
    or an assortment of individual acts is a genuine issue of trial.  If and
    to the extent that the employees’ acts are found to be independent and separate,
    whether particular dishonest acts caused loss or were done with the manifest
    intent to cause loss may become issues at trial.  To the extent that the
    requirements of the coverage clause are met, I have concluded that the questions
    of whether the condition for “Termination” and the condition for “Notice
    of Loss” apply are genuine issues for trial.  At the trial, either party
    may rely on any provision of the bond I have not interpreted, or on any provision
    of the bond in a manner not inconsistent with the interpretation I have provided.  The
    parties are not foreclosed from adducing evidence at trial relevant to the
    interpretation of the bond in these reasons.  Depending on how these issues
    are determined, the quantum of the Credit Union’s loss will be an issue at
    trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[121]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    cross-appeal is moot and whether the Credit Union may claim the amounts disallowed
    by the motion judge is a genuine issue for trial.  </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[122]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the foregoing reasons, I would allow the appeal, set aside the summary judgment
    granted by the motion judge, and dismiss the summary judgment motion brought
    by the Credit Union.</p>
