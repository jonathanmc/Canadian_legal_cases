    the conclusion of argument in this case, the court allowed the appeal, set
    aside the appellant’s convictions and ordered a new trial.  The court indicated
    that it would provide written reasons for this disposition. These are the
    reasons.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the appellant raised several grounds of appeal from his conviction on charges
    of sexual assault and theft by Hamilton J., this appeal can be resolved on
    the basis that the trial judge breached the appellant’s right to be present
    at his trial as required by s.650 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  Since the
    appellant was prejudiced by this error, the convictions cannot stand.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS OF THE OFFENCES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    charges against the appellant arose out of two incidents that allegedly occurred
    on January 3, 2004 in an apartment building in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto.  K.B. testified that she encountered the appellant when she was
    waiting for the elevator.  She recognized the appellant as a friend of a
    friend, but she had never met him.  They went to the apartment of this mutual
    friend. Upon discovering that their friend was not home, K.B. attempted to
    negotiate the purchase of narcotics from the appellant.  According to K.B.,
    the appellant forced her to perform fellatio on him and then have sexual
    intercourse.  It is alleged that this activity took place in the stairwell
    of the apartment. The assault was interrupted on several occasions by the
    complainant’s cell phone ringing and someone coming into the stairwell.  The
    appellant abruptly stopped the sexual assault, took K.B.’s cell phone and
    money and ran down the stairs.  K.B. chased the appellant but when she could
    not find him, she reported to the security office that she had been sexually
    assaulted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Some
    hours later the appellant visited the apartment where the second complainant,
    C.G. was living. Numerous friends, including the appellant, visited C.G.
    and her roommate at this apartment and stayed overnight.  C.G. testified
    that she was asleep on the living room couch when the appellant woke her
    and dragged her into the bedroom.  There the appellant sexually assaulted
    the complainant for half an hour.  While the appellant had a shower, the
    complainant left the apartment and called a family member and reported the
    assault.  She stayed the night with her boyfriend and also told him about
    the assault.  Some days later, C.G. was contacted by the police and complained
    to them about the sexual assault.  C.G. conceded that at one time she had
    had a crush on the appellant.  She also testified that earlier on the same
    day as the alleged sexual assault, she had walked in on the appellant having
    sexual intercourse with her cousin.  The transcript indicates that, on several
    occasions, C.G., who seems to be somewhat intellectually challenged, took
    long pauses before answering questions put to her in cross-examination</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant did not testify and did not call any evidence.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>PROCEDURAL ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the opening of the trial, the appellant applied to sever the counts relating
    to the two complainants.  At the same time, the Crown applied to have the
    evidence concerning the two complainants admitted as similar fact evidence.  The
    trial judge did not rule on the similar fact evidence issue at the time but
    dismissed the severance motion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown
    counsel called C.G. as her first witness.  In the course of the cross-examination
    of C.G., the trial judge adjourned for lunch early and asked counsel to join
    him in his retiring room.  The appellant was not present during this meeting,
    nor was a court reporter.  As fresh evidence on appeal, the parties provided
    an agreed statement of facts as to what occurred during this meeting.  As
    well, the appellant and his trial counsel, not Mr. Lacy, provided affidavits.  Trial
    counsel was cross-examined on his affidavit; the appellant was not.  I will
    summarize that evidence below.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    the lunch break, the trial resumed.  Trial counsel continued his cross-examination
    of C.G.  Crown counsel then called K.B. and she was cross-examined.  As indicated,
    the appellant did not call any evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the course of submissions at the conclusion of the trial, the trial judge
    indicated that he would not use the evidence of each complainant as similar
    fact in relation to the other complainant.  He also stated that he may have
    erred in dismissing the severance application.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>REASONS FOR JUDGMENT</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge reviewed the evidence of the two complainants.  He rejected the
    submission that the complainants consented and that their evidence was unreliable.  In
    the course of his brief reasons, the trial judge mentioned on four occasions
    that the appellant did not testify or call any evidence.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE FRESH EVIDENCE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    agreed statement of facts may be summarized as follows.  In the course of
    C.G.’s testimony, the trial judge recessed court and directed counsel to
    see him in chambers.  Counsel agree that the trial judge said words to the
    effect that he could not convict on the charge relating to C.G. because of
    the witness’s refusal to answer questions and her apparent motive to fabricate.  Crown
    counsel also recalls that the trial judge said he would not convict on this
    evidence and that “if the accused took the stand and was somewhat credible,
    there would likely be an acquittal.”  Defence counsel does not recall the
    remark about the appellant having to testify to secure his acquittal.  Both
    counsel do recall the trial judge asking Crown counsel to consider withdrawing
    the charge because of the quality of the evidence.  Crown counsel responded
    to the effect that there was still re-examination, as well as other evidence,
    and she hoped that after hearing all the evidence and considering the similar
    fact application the trial judge would change his mind.  The trial judge
    stated that he had never seen anyone win a case on re-examination.  At that
    point, Crown counsel asked the trial judge if had already decided the case;
    he responded that he had not and that he would keep an open mind.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his affidavit the appellant’s trial counsel stated that after the lunch break
    he informed his client of the contents of the chambers conversation. He also
    stated that with his client’s consent, he cut short his cross-examination
    of C.G.  However, it should be said that the transcript discloses that the
    cross-examination continued for some time and it is unclear what areas of
    the complainant’s evidence were allegedly not explored by counsel.  Trial
    counsel also stated the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>My advice to my client throughout the trial after
    the out of court discussions with the trial judge and my client’s decision
    not to testify was in large part based upon the comments made by the trial
    judge [in chambers].</p>

    his affidavit, the appellant stated that after the meeting in chambers, his
    counsel informed him that the trial judge had questioned why the trial was
    happening in the first place, and stated that he could not convict on the
    testimony offered thus far. He also stated this:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In consultation with my lawyer, we decided that
    nothing would be gained from testifying in light of the comments by the Judge.  Although
    we re-assessed that situation after the second witness testified, we remained
    of the belief that it was not necessary to testify because the Judge had
    given an indication that he could not convict.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE RIGHT TO BE PRESENT AT TRIAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Subject
    to certain exceptions that do not apply in this case, an accused is entitled
    to be present at his trial.  This fundamental principle is set out in s.
    650(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, which provides as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Subject to subsections (1.1) to (2) and section
    650.01, an accused, other than an organization, shall be present in court
    during the whole of his or her trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    court has held that not everything that occurs during the trial is part of
    the “trial” for the purposes of s. 650(1).  The most complete discussion
    of this issue is by Martin J.A. in <i>R. v. Hertrich</i> (1982), 67 C.C.C.
    (2d) 510 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  As he said, the essential reason an accused needs to be present at trial
    is so that the accused can hear the case made out against them and have the
    opportunity to answer it.  This right also gives effect to the fundamental
    values of fairness and openness.  As Martin J.A. said at p. 537:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The presence of the accused at all stages of his
    trial affords him the opportunity of acquiring first-hand knowledge of the
    proceedings leading to the eventual result of the trial. The denial of that
    opportunity to an accused may well leave him with a justifiable sense of
    injustice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    these principles, Martin J.A.  held that the accused had the right “to have
    direct knowledge of anything that transpires in the course of his trial which
    could involve his vital interests”: <i>Hertrich, </i>at p. 539.  Subsequent
    cases have adopted an expansive view of what constitutes part of the trial
    to vindicate these policies.  See <i>R. v. Barrow</i>, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 694,
    at 704, and <i>R. v. Laws</i> (1998), 41 O.R. (3d) 499 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), at 521.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the in-chambers discussion was part of the trial.  The trial judge,
    who in this judge alone trial was the trier of fact, expressed his strong,
    if premature, views as to the credibility of one of the two Crown witnesses.
    That this discussion affected the appellant’s vital interests is demonstrated
    by the impact it had on the course of the trial and in particular, on the
    appellant’s decision not to testify.  The danger of holding such meetings
    where the accused does not have first hand knowledge of the discussion and
    where, with the absence of the court reporter, no accurate record is kept,
    is manifest in the disagreement between counsel as to what was said.  If
    Crown counsel is correct and the trial judge’s view of the Crown witness’s
    credibility depended on the accused testifying, the accused was misled by
    his own counsel.  He acted upon erroneous information and advice because
    he was not present for this part of the trial.  In short, the appellant’s
    ability to make full answer and defence was affected by what occurred in
    the chambers meeting.  Given the outcome of the trial, and the trial judge’s
    repeated reference in his reasons to the appellant’s failure to testify,
    the appellant could well have a justifiable sense of injustice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>APPLICATION OF THE PROVISO</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    686(1)(b)(iv) of the <i>Criminal Code</i> provides that notwithstanding any
    procedural irregularity at trial, the trial court had jurisdiction over the
    class of offence of which the appellant was convicted and the court of appeal
    is of the opinion that the appellant suffered no prejudice thereby.  In <i>R.
    v. Cloutier</i> (1988), 43 C.C.C. (3d) 35 (Ont.
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), at 51, Goodman J.A. held that the words “suffered no prejudice thereby” means
    in the context of s. 650(1), “that the exclusion of the appellant did not
    affect the outcome of the trial adversely to him”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    statement in the appellant’s affidavit that he did not testify because of
    what he had been told about the trial judge’s comments demonstrates that
    his exclusion did affect the outcome of the trial adversely to him.  Even
    if those comments were merely one factor that the appellant took into account
    in making his decision, he was prejudiced by the error.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Cloutier</i>,
    Goodman J.A. also held that the court may refuse to apply the proviso in
    s. 686(1)(b)(iv), even if exclusion of the accused from the trial created
    no prejudice, “so that justice will not only be done but will be seen to
    be done”: at p. 52.  In my view, this is the kind of case where this court
    should exercise its discretion not to apply the proviso even if there were
    no prejudice.  The words of this court in <i>Laws</i>, at p. 525,  apply
    to what occurred here:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The perceived fairness of the criminal justice
    system is its most vital characteristic. Public confidence requires public
    scrutiny wherever possible. Private trials which exclude the accused are
    antithetical to this core value. Where the circumstances of the exclusion
    of the accused are such as to inflict significant damage on the appearance
    of justice, the question is not whether there is prejudice to the accused.
    Rather, the issue is the harm to the criminal justice system itself. In such
    cases the court should refuse to apply this proviso.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge expressed opinions about the credibility of one of two critical
    Crown witnesses while she was still testifying, before he had heard all the
    evidence the Crown intended to call and before he had heard submissions from
    counsel.  He appears to have commented on one of the fundamental choices
    an accused must make, the decision whether or not to testify.  All of this
    took place in private when both the accused and the public were excluded.  This
    procedure was not only ill advised; it had the potential to undermine confidence
    in the administration of criminal justice.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>DISPOSITION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    noted above, at the conclusion of oral argument, the court indicated that
    the appeal was allowed, the convictions set aside and a new trial ordered.  Having
    regard to the nature of the error that led to that disposition and that the
    appellant has served the sentence imposed, the Crown will want to consider
    whether or not it would be in the interests of justice to proceed with a
    new trial.</p>
