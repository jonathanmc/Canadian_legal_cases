      was a straightforward, uncomplicated case. The two complainants, S and
      V, claimed that the appellant, who was their mother’s live-in boyfriend,
      sexually assaulted and molested them over a period of time during their
      pre-teen and early teenage years. The incidents of abuse occurred in the
      three residences that the family occupied from 1996 to 1999. As a general
      rule, the sexual misconduct occurred in the bedroom where the particular
      complainant happened to be sleeping on any given night. On some occasions,
      the incidents with S would occur when she was by herself; on others, her
      brother and sister V might be sleeping in the same room. The same held
      true for the incidents involving V. </span></p>

      appellant’s advances towards S commenced with touching and fondling and
      proceeded to full intercourse. In V’s case, the abuse was restricted to
      fondling and touching.</span></p>

      particular significance, both S and V claimed that it was the appellant’s
      habit to crawl on his hands and knees into the room where one or the other
      or both were sleeping as a prelude to his sexual advances.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At
      the time of trial in 2005, S was 21 years-old. She testified that the incidents
      of abuse against her occurred when she was between the ages of 12 and 15.
      V was 18 years-old at the time of trial. The incidents of abuse towards
      her occurred when she was between the ages of 10 and 13. </span></p>

      and V testified that while the abuse was ongoing, neither knew that the
      other was being abused. It was not until 2002, when S and V were engaged
      in a heated discussion about why S was not living with their mother, that
      S told V about the appellant’s sexual misconduct. When V heard this, she
      started to cry and told S that the appellant had also touched her inappropriately.
      On hearing this, S telephoned their natural father and he came over immediately.
      Later that night, V and S reported the abuse to the police. According to
      V, she and S
    “barely talk[ed] about [the issue] that brought them to court”. </span></p>

      testified that she did not tell anyone about the abuse at the time it was
      occurring because she was frightened and ashamed and felt that no one would
      listen to her. Over the objection of defence counsel, S was permitted to
      testify that she was afraid to disclose the sexual abuse as it was occurring
      because, among other things, the appellant was physically abusive towards
      her mother and she did not want her mother to be hurt, nor did she want
      to be hurt.  For her part, V also kept the abuse a secret, except for telling
      some friends at school whom she trusted. V felt that she could not go to
      the police because she was frightened and embarrassed. She did not tell
      her mother because “it would just cause a lot of trouble in my family”.</span></p>

      appellant did not testify at trial, nor did the complainants’ mother. Through
      cross-examination of S and V, the appellant advanced a position that S
      and V disliked their mother because she was abusive towards them, both
      physically and emotionally, and in order to get back at her, they hatched
      a plan to falsely accuse the appellant of sexual abuse. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      support of his allegation of collusion, the appellant adduced evidence
      from S about her relationship with her mother, including the fact that
      her mother was bad tempered and “beat [her] up a lot”. S also agreed that
      on occasion, she called the police on her mother and apparently the Children’s
      Aid Society as well. S further acknowledged that as of the date of trial,
      she had not contacted her mother for a long time. That said, she stated
      that she still loved her mother: “I don’t hate my mom. I love her. She’s
      done some things obviously that I don’t agree with, but I still love her”.</span></p>

      denied the suggestion that she and V had concocted the allegations against
      the appellant to “get back” at him and her mother. V denied the suggestion
      as well, even though she acknowledged the troubled relationship between
      S and their mother and the fact that their mother would “hit [them] now
      and then”. </span></p>

      further support of his collusion theory, the appellant called two witnesses,
      M.F. and his daughter Ma.F., each of whom testified that on an unspecified
      occasion prior to the appellant’s arrest, S came to their home and told
      them, in some unspecified context, that she hated her mother, that she
      was going to hurt her “where it would hurt her the most” and that she was
      going to get V to help her.</span></p>

    of S’s alleged communication, despite being certain in his examination-in-chief
    that it had occurred before the appellant’s arrest. M.F. also had no idea
    about how the conversation had come about and he acknowledged that prior

      godfather, and she was not concerned about the allegations against him
      because they were
    “unbelievable”. While she claimed to have remembered S’s remarks because
    they were “important”, she acknowledged that she had not told the police
    or the appellant or anyone else about them until the day she testified “because
    there is other things … it’s a busy life and everything”. In examination-in-chief,
    when defence counsel [not Mr. Copeland] asked her whether she had heard S
    say anything negative about the appellant, she replied that she had not and
    stated

      In his view, Ma.F. had opened the door by claiming that her belief that

      would be postponed until the completion of the evidence. In anticipation
      of final argument, the Crown had provided the trial judge with a comprehensive
      factum containing the relevant authorities and the Crown’s position on
      the permissible uses of the proposed similar fact evidence. One section
      of the factum was devoted to the issue of “collusion” and it set out the
      governing principles, including the principle from <i>R. v. Handy</i> (2002),
      164 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (S.C.C.), that if there was an air of reality to the

      V’s credibility because S’s allegations, which included allegations of
      full penetration, were far more serious than the acts described by V and

  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Ground One – Did the trial

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Before
      this court, counsel for the appellant did not argue that the trial judge
      erred in failing to give effect to the argument made by defence counsel
      at trial. Rather, he submitted that on the trial record, there was an air
      of reality to the appellant’s allegation of collusion and the trial judge
      was therefore obliged to address the issue and explain why he was satisfied,
      on balance, that the proposed similar fact evidence was not tainted by
      collusion. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First,
      the trial judge was not obliged in the circumstances to address an argument
      that was not raised by defence counsel. There is no suggestion here that
      defence counsel was incompetent and by not raising the issue of collusion,
      he was surely signaling the trial judge that the threshold question was
      a non-issue. Put differently, I can think of no reason why competent counsel
      would not have raised the issue of collusion in argument if he had thought
      it had the slightest chance of success. In short, it is apparent to me
      that defence counsel was content to let the jury consider the issue of
      collusion and decide its impact, if any, on the probative value of the
      similar fact evidence.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second,
      it does not follow from defence counsel’s failure to raise the issue of
      collusion that the trial judge ignored it. The trial judge had the benefit
      of the Crown’s factum on the law of collusion and, in any event, trial
      judges are presumed to know the law. Hence, I start from the premise that
      the trial judge did consider the issue of collusion and concluded that
      it either lacked an air of reality or that he was satisfied, on balance,
      that the testimony of the complainants was not tainted by collusion. The
      appellant has presented nothing to the contrary.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Looked
      at from a slightly difference perspective, in view of defence counsel’s
      failure to raise the issue and given that the trial judge’s decision was
      discretionary, to succeed on this ground, the appellant would have to show
      that on this record, no trial judge acting reasonably could have been satisfied
      on balance that the complainants’ evidence was not tainted by collusion.
      In my view, the evidence falls far short of meeting that test. Accordingly,
      I would not give effect to the first ground of appeal.</span></p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Ground Two – Did the trial

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      his charge to the jury, the trial judge succinctly summarized the essence
      of the appellant’s position as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[Defence counsel’s] position is
      that, in effect, you can and should find that this did not happen. He suggests
      that there was collusion between the two sisters and suggests that it is
      all made up. He asks you not to believe the complainants because of various
      inconsistencies in their testimony, and he points out some of the implausibilities,
      that he would ask you to deny acceptance of their testimony. He has outlined
      the failure to reveal the acts of the accused for a considerable length
      of time before they went to the police. You will have to consider that. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Earlier
      in the charge, the trial judge instructed the jury on the use they could
      make of the similar fact evidence by each complainant. His instructions
      in this regard are reproduced below:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Now, in this case there has been
      an indication that there are some similar acts and I will deal with the
      approach that you should take with respect to similar acts. You will recall
      that both complainants indicated that the accused person was on his hands
      and knees while coming into the room and there may be other events or acts
      or evidence that you consider to be similar. The Crown has asked you to
      use such acts as confirmatory of other acts.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Now, the defendant is charged
      with a number of offences here and I would say to you that each charge
      requires its own proof. The ones that overlap, you must consider each charge
      and it requires its own proof.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The real issue for you to decide
      in this case is whether the offences alleged by each complainant ever actually
      took place. Be careful not to jump to the conclusion that if one complainant
      is telling the truth, the other must be telling the truth as well, nor
      should you jump to the conclusion that because the complainants allege
      similar conduct they all must have occurred if any one of them is proved.
      It is up to the Crown counsel to prove each charge independently of the
      other. However, you may but do not have to find that there is a pattern
      of similar behaviour that confirms each complainant’s testimony that the
      offence took place. It is for you to say in considering the evidence and
      bearing in mind the relationship between the defendant and the complainants,
      as well as the circumstances of all the situations.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Following
      these instructions, the trial judge moved immediately to the subject of
      collusion. He did so, quite properly, because he recognized that the appellant
      was relying on collusion to blunt the force of the apparent similarities
      in the complainants’ evidence and to show that their testimony was contrived
      and not worthy of belief. No issue is taken with the trial judge’s instruction
      on the meaning of collusion, nor its impact on the worth of the complainants’
    testimony, depending on the jury’s assessment of it. </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Viewing
      the matter realistically, I believe that the foregoing instructions provided
      the jurors with the tools they needed to arrive at a fair and just verdict.
      Put simply, on this record, if the jury did not believe or have a reasonable
      doubt that the evidence of the complainants was a product of collusion,
      the appellant’s fate was all but sealed. </span></p>

      trial counsel felt the same way. Otherwise, given that his competence is
      not challenged, surely he would have asked the trial judge to provide the
      limiting instructions that counsel on appeal insists, for the first time,
      should have been given. The missing instructions, now claimed to have been
      mandatory, are set out below:</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span
lang=EN-US>(1)       The trial judge should have warned the jury against using
      the similar fact evidence to show that the appellant had a general disposition

      to have committed the offences charged;</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span
lang=EN-US>(2)       The jury should have been told that they could not use the
      evidence of the appellant’s violent conduct towards the complainants’ mother
      to show that he was prone to behave violently and, on that basis, infer
      that he was likely to have committed the offences as charged; and</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span
lang=EN-US>(3)       The jury should have been told that they could not use the
      appellant’s violent conduct towards the complainants’ mother to show that
      he was a bad person and therefore deserving of punishment.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Beginning
      with the last complaint – bad character evidence – it is true that a limiting
      instruction could have been given. Had the trial judge given it, however,
      he would, as a matter of fairness, have had to combine it with an instruction
      on the way in which the assaultive conduct could be used in order to explain
      why the complainants, out of fear, had not made a timely disclosure. In
      his charge, the trial judge made no mention of this, although he did leave
      the question of delayed disclosure, relied on by the defence, for the jury’s
      consideration. No doubt, competent defence counsel was content to let sleeping
      dogs lie. </span></p>

      any event, I find it inconceivable that this or any other jury would convict
      the appellant on the serious charges he was facing, not because he was
      guilty of them, but because he deserved to be punished for assaulting the
      complainants’
    mother. Quite frankly, with respect to those who see the matter differently,
    I find the proposition startling and part company with those who have so
    little faith in juries.</span></p>

      for the second complaint – impermissible reasoning from the appellant’s
      assaultive disposition – I accept that the instruction sought by counsel
      on appeal could have been given. But like the first complaint, it too could
      be viewed as a “double-edged”
    sword, seeing as it would have highlighted one of the major weakness in Ma.F.’s
    evidence – her belief that the complainants were not being truthful because
    of her perception that the appellant was not the type of person who would
    do what the complainants accused him of doing. Given that Ma.F.’s evidence
    went to the crucial issue of collusion, it makes perfect sense that defence
    counsel would not have wanted the weaknesses in her testimony exposed to
    the jury any more than necessary. In his charge, the trial judge had made
    no mention of Ma.F. Presumably, defence counsel was content to leave matters
    that way.</span></p>

      the case at hand, the similar fact evidence gained its probity from the
      improbability of two people coincidentally giving the same evidence. Here,
      as the Crown points out paragraph 19 of its factum, absent collusion or
      some other form of tainting, its probative value was extremely high:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The similarities in the testimony
      of these two witnesses [the complainants] were so numerous and so distinctive
      that to suggest that they were the result of coincidence would defy common
      sense. In fact, some of the sisters’ evidence –
    particularly the fact that the appellant entered their bedrooms crawling
    on the floor on his hands and knees – even rises above the requisite level
    of connectedness. This similar fact evidence is in fact so peculiar and unusually
    distinctive that it almost rises to the level of the ‘striking similarity’
    required to use similar fact evidence to prove identity.</span></p>

      the circumstances of this case, if collusion is eliminated, the impermissible “general
      disposition” inference – that the appellant is the kind of person who is
      prone to sexually abusing young females and for that reason, is more likely
      to have committed the offences with which he is charged – is swallowed
      up by the permissible “specific disposition” inference – that the appellant

      could have raised, but did not – is not an uncommon one in this court.
      And, as in this case, it will generally result in a failed appeal. Indeed,
      it will only succeed in those cases where, despite the failure to raise
      the issue now said to be crucial, counsel on appeal can demonstrate a reversible
      error of law or a miscarriage of justice. As our jurisprudence indicates,
      that will be no easy task. </span></p>
