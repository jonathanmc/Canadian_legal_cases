  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants submit that the motion judge erred in law in allowing the Master’s
    report to be confirmed when the Master made errors in principle, purported
    to act in the absence of or in excess of his jurisdiction, and patently misapprehended
    the evidence regarding:</p>
  <p style='
line-height:150%;'>1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    failure to give the appellants credit for their unequal capital contribution
    to the acquisition and maintenance of the subject property; and</p>
  <p style='
line-height:150%;'>2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    development fees claimed by the respondent.</p>
  <h3>a)         Unequal capital contribution</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants’ argument on the Master’s failure to give them credit for an equal
    capital contribution is in essence that the appellants should not be bound
    by the agreement concluded with the respondent in 1982, as it was made in
    error.  This alleged error was denied by the respondent.  The Master specifically
    rejected this claim, finding that the alleged mistake in the 1982 agreement
    and in the appellants’ calculations explaining the mistake were lacking in
    any reliable evidentiary support.  This finding is amply supported in the
    record.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    oral argument, the appellants maintained that the Master had failed to give “enough
    significance” to the evidence that supported their position on this issue.  For
    example, the appellants relied on the apparent willingness of Mr. Grenier,
    the principal of the respondent, to reach a settlement on the capital contribution
    issue.  The question of how much significance is to be given to each element
    of the evidence was first and foremost a matter for the Master.  Unless he
    misapprehended the evidence, this court must defer to his assessment.  We
    see no misapprehension of the evidence by the Master and, therefore, find
    no basis to interfere.</p>
  <h3>b)        Development fees</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants’ submission on the alleged error in allowing part of the respondent’s
    claim for development fees is, in effect, that the Master did not hold the
    respondent to the letter of its written development agreement with the appellants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, contrary to the appellants’ claim, the Master did not override
    the terms of the contract between the parties.  It is apparent from the evidence
    that once the parties discovered that the subdivision approval for the partnership’s
    proposed development had lapsed, the parties no longer conducted themselves
    on the basis that their relationship was governed by the strict terms of
    the agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent effectively carried out the work that was to be done by Cataract
    Lands Ltd., a company that had been set up by the respondent to be the developer.  The
    development fees that were to accrue in Cataract and paid upon substantial
    completion became, in fact, fees accrued by Pagebrook for its work done to
    advance the project until a resolution of the lawsuit was reached and the
    property sold.  The fees were initially $40,000 per year and later reduced
    to $10,000 per year once the parties became aware that the subdivision approval
    had lapsed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Master was aware of the contractual arguments now raised by the appellants.  In
    our view, he reached a balanced and fair result consistent with the intent
    of the development agreement.  His findings are well supported by the evidence.  Contrary
    to the appellants’ submission, it falls squarely within the jurisdiction
    conferred on the Master by rule 55.04(1)(e) to settle accounts and make just
    allowances.</p>
  <h3>c)         Did the Master otherwise err in his apprehension of the evidence
    or exceed his jurisdiction?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Many
    of the other points raised by the appellants are, as stated by the motion
    judge, an attempt to retry the facts or to second guess the Master.  As is
    apparent from her thorough reasons, the motion judge carefully considered
    many of the same issues now raised by the appellants in this court.  She
    concluded that “The Master acted within the jurisdiction allowed him under
    Rule 55.04(1)(e) on the taking of accounts” and that “based on a reasonable
    assessment of the evidence before him, he arrived at fair and reasonable
    conclusions on each issue.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree.  The Master reached his conclusions after four days of testimony and
    after reviewing the parties’ affidavits and voluminous documents and exhibits.  He
    heard one and a half days of argument, received additional written submissions
    and held a further attendance to settle the terms of the final report.  He
    ruled in favour of the respondent on some issues but against it on others.  He
    exercised his jurisdiction to reduce certain amounts claimed by the respondent
    and he made appropriate allowances to arrive at a result that was balanced
    and fair in all the circumstances and in light of the evidence he heard.  We
    see no basis to interfere with his conclusions.  Nor do we find any error
    in the motion judge’s decision to confirm the Master’s report. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, the appeal is dismissed.  Costs to the respondent are fixed
    in the amount of $10,000, including GST and disbursements.</p>
