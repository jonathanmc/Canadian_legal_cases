    appellant was convicted of one count each of committing an indecent act in
    a public place and breach of recognizance, and two counts of breach of probation.  He
    received a global sentence of nine months’ imprisonment, followed by three
    years’ probation.  A D.N.A. databank order and a weapons prohibition order
    were also imposed.  The appellant appeals his convictions, having abandoned
    his appeal against sentence.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    predicate offences arose from an incident that occurred at approximately
    9:45 p.m. on the evening of July 30, 2006 in the city of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ottawa.  The complainant alleged that she observed the appellant driving
    his car slowly and in a suspicious manner in her neighbourhood.  She said
    that the appellant indicated that he needed directions and held a map outside
    his car window as the complainant approached his vehicle.  While the complainant
    was providing the requested directions, the appellant gradually moved the
    map back into the car, eventually placing it on or near his lap.  The complainant
    leaned into the car to point out her suggested route to the appellant’s destination
    on the map.  As she did so, the map fell away, revealing the appellant’s
    exposed penis, which the complainant then inadvertently “poked”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant provided a starkly different version of events in his trial testimony.  He
    said that when he stopped his car in order to examine a piece of paper containing
    directions to his destination, the complainant approached his vehicle of
    her own accord and tapped on his window, inquiring whether he was lost.  The
    appellant claimed that when he rolled down his window to reply, the complainant
    leaned through the window and reached over the appellant to “grab” the paper
    that the appellant had been examining.  According to the appellant, a
    “tug-of-war” then ensued with the complainant over the possession of the
    piece of paper, during which the complainant yelled at the appellant, accused
    him of being a thief, and threatened to call the police.  The appellant maintained,
    in effect, that he responded by inviting the complainant to call the police,
    driving his vehicle forward to provide the complainant with a view of his
    licence plate, and then proceeding on his way. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge accepted the complainant’s evidence.  He rejected the appellant’s
    testimony, indicating that key elements of the appellant’s version of events
    made “absolutely no sense”, lacked credibility and reliability and were “fanciful
    at best”.  He concluded, “on the totality of the evidence”, that nothing
    raised “any reasonable doubt as to what occurred [at] the time and place
    in question”.  Accordingly, he convicted the appellant of the crimes charged.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    behalf of the appellant, duty counsel argues that the trial judge misappre-hended
    the complainant’s evidence, leading to an unreasonable verdict.  He points
    out that during cross-examination, the complainant was shown a wooden key
    chain and asked if she had ever seen it before.  It was then suggested to
    the complainant that if the key chain was sitting on the appellant’s lap
    in a dark car, “it could very easily resemble a penis”.  The following exchange
    took place regarding the key chain:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Q.        Is this possibly what you saw and touched
    that evening?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A.        May I touch it?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Q.        Sure, of course.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A.        Well, it feels different but I don’t know.  I
    don’t know.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Q.        Okay.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A.        I don’t know.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the basis of this exchange, duty counsel argues that the complainant admitted
    to uncertainty regarding the events alleged, in particular, concerning the
    indecent act described by her during her examination-in-chief.  This admission,
    duty counsel asserts, necessitated the appellant’s acquittal on all charges.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    disagree.  A review of the entirety of the complainant’s evidence indicates
    that she was clear and precise in her testimony regarding the fact of the
    appellant’s exposure of his penis and the surrounding circumstances.  It
    was open to the trial judge to accept this evidence, notwithstanding the
    defence suggestion that the complainant had mistaken a wooden key chain for
    the appellant’s penis.  We say this for three reasons.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    the trial judge was alive to the complainant’s response to the defence hypothesis
    that she had observed and touched a wooden key chain, rather than the appellant’s
    penis.  But he correctly noted that the complainant had said that the key
    chain did not feel like what she had touched.  Thus, although the complainant
    did not reject the possibility that she had seen and touched a key chain,
    she did not concede that she had done so.  Nor did she resile in any way
    from her account of what she said had transpired with the appellant.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    the transcript of the appellant’s evidence at trial reveals that he never
    actually asserted that the complainant had seen and touched a wooden key
    chain rather than his penis.  Virtually at the outset of his testimony, and
    without prompting from his counsel, the appellant introduced the subject
    of a wooden key chain that he said was present in the front seat of his car
    on the night in question.  But he did not assert that the complainant had
    seen or touched the key chain.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge was mindful of this important omission in the appellant’s testimony.  He
    put it this way:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[T]his key [chain] was put forward very quickly
    in evidence before it was even asked of him and how it came to be and how
    it rolled on the floor and why he picked it up and yet it apparently played
    absolutely no part, in my assessment of the evidence, of what he said had
    happened.  There is no sugges-tion that she had reached in and accidentally
    touched this object or there is no suggestion that her version of events
    that it was possible that something like [the key chain] could portray itself
    as a penis [<i>sic</i>].  In my view that introduction bears no resemblance
    to the reality of the facts.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus,
    although defence counsel posited the theory that a key chain was mistaken
    by the complainant for the appellant’s penis, in the end this hypothesis
    was entirely speculative and unsupported by any evidence, including that
    of the appellant himself.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    as we have said, the trial judge rejected the appellant’s evidence in its
    entirety.  He gave numerous cogent reasons for so doing.  His assessment
    of the evidence, including his credibility findings, attract great deference
    from this court.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    conviction appeal is dismissed.  </p>
