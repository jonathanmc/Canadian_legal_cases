class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario can be held liable for damages suffered by individuals who contracted
    SARS during the outbreak of that illness in 2003.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Karim
    Jamal contracted SARS in mid-March 2003, and died on April 30, 2003.  This
    action, brought by his estate trustee and family members, names
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario, three hospitals and several doctors as defendants.  The claim alleges
    that
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario was negligent by failing to protect Jamal from the SARS virus.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    in <i>Williams v. Ontario</i> and the other related appeals, Ontario moved
    under Rule 21 to strike out the “consolidated” statement of claim (“the claim”)
    on the ground that the facts as pleaded did not establish that Ontario owed
    the plaintiffs a private law duty of care.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge incorporated his reasons for decision in <i>Williams</i>, and
    struck out those portions of the claim that he found dealt with duties owed
    by
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario to the public as a whole.  However, relying on the decision of the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court in <i>Eliopoulos (Litigation Trustee of) v.
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario (Minister of Health and Long-Term Care</i>) (2005), 76 O.R. (3d)
    36, he refused to strike out substantial parts of the negligence claim against
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    in the <i>Williams</i> and the other related appeals, Ontario relies on the
    reversal of the Divisional Court’s <i>Eliopoulos</i> judgment by this court,
    holding that while Ontario did owe a public law duty to promote health and
    protect against the spread of the West Nile virus, there was no relationship
    of proximity between the plaintiff and Ontario capable of giving rise to
    a private law duty of care: (2006), 82 O.R. (3d) 321 (“<i>Eliopoulos</i>”)
    (leave to appeal denied: <span style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none;text-underline:
none'>[2006] S.C.C.A. No. 514</span>).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the underlying facts and issues raised on this appeal are essentially the
    same as those dealt with in <i>Williams</i>, I adopt the reasons given in <i>Williams</i> and
    will not repeat the background facts and legal analysis which is common to
    both appeals.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    claim alleges that following a hospital visit, Karim Jamal contracted SARS
    on March 16 or March 17, 2003, was diagnosed with SARS on or about April
    4, 2003, and that he died on April 30, 2003. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    noted by the motion judge, the claim makes few explicit allegations of any
    actions of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario in connection with the SARS outbreak.  The claim essentially rests
    upon general assertions that the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care is  responsible
    for administering the health care system and for the provision of health
    care services to the Ontario public, including the regulation of public hospitals
    and disease control and prevention and has regulatory powers over the establishment,
    maintenance and management of the defendant hospitals.  The claim also alleges
    that the Ministry of Public Safety and Security is responsible for the creation,
    implementation and enforcement of protocols, regulations and or/procedures
    maintained for the protection of the public and that the Commissioner of
    Public Safety was responsible for establishing, coordinating and implementing
    public safety initiatives within the Province of Ontario.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    claim fails to relate those general allegations to events that occurred during
    the SARS crisis.  It does, however, contain certain particulars of
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario’s alleged negligence, conveniently summarized in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario’s factum as follows:</p>
  <p><span style='"MS Mincho"'>(i)        failure to have any plan or any adequate
      plan to deal with SARS;</span></p>
  <p><span style='"MS Mincho"'>(ii)       failure to properly fund or staff hospitals
      to permit adequate monitoring, treatment and control of infectious diseases;</span></p>
  <p><span style='"MS Mincho"'>(iii)     failure to create  information sharing  and  tracking
      system(s), for example, for daily surveillance of patients and hospital
      employees, and for  communication between the provincial government and
      hospital employees, and between different levels of government; </span></p>
  <p><span style='"MS Mincho"'>(iv)      failure to provide proper or any leadership
      in directing the management of the outbreak of SARS, or to have created
      a provincial disease centre and failure to issue adequate directives to
      health care providers;</span></p>
  <p><span style='"MS Mincho"'>(v)       failure to provide adequate protective
      equipment to hospital employees and visitors;</span></p>
  <p><span style='"MS Mincho"'>(vi)      failure to enforce provincial mandates
      and protocols dealing with infectious diseases;</span></p>
  <p><span style='"MS Mincho"'>(vii)     failure to limit the use of quarantine
      methods and failure to prevent patients and hospital employees for re-entering
      the community;</span></p>
  <p><span style='"MS Mincho"'>(viii)    failure to warn members of the public;
      and</span></p>
  <p><span style='"MS Mincho"'>(ix)      breach of the requirements of the Public
      Hospitals Act.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario argues that the claim should have been struck out in its entirety
    because it fails to allege any material facts to support a claim in negligence.  While
    I see considerable merit in that submission, I prefer to dispose of this
    appeal on substantive rather than procedural grounds. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    the extent that the claim does allege facts against
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario, the allegations add nothing to what was alleged in <i>Williams</i>.  For
    the reasons given in <i>Williams</i>, I conclude that it is plain and obvious
    that
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    Ontario did not owe Karim Jamal a private law duty of care and that the claim
    against
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario should be struck out and the action against

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario dismissed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I would allow

    Ontario’s appeal, and as against
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario, strike the claim in its entirety and dismiss the action. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
