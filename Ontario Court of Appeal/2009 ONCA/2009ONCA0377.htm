  <p style='line-height:200%'><b>Overview</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    appeal relates to a representative plaintiff’s right to choose new counsel
    in a class proceeding, following the dissolution of the law firm originally
    retained by the plaintiff to prosecute the action. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant is a law firm, Kim Orr Barristers P.C. (“KO”). Joseph Fantl is
    the representative plaintiff in a class proceeding brought against the defendant
    Transamerica Life
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    (“Transamerica”). Both Mr. Fantl and Transamerica are respondents in this
    appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    2006, Mr. Fantl retained the law firm of Roy Elliott Kim O’Connor (“REKO”)
    to act in the prosecution of the intended class action lawsuit against Transamerica.
    A team of REKO lawyers worked on the matter. Toward the end of 2007, REKO
    dissolved.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Certain
    of the team of lawyers formerly engaged on the file joined the newly formed
    law firm of Roy Elliott O’Connor (“REO”). Others followed one of REKO’s former
    partners, Won Kim, to form the appellant law firm KO, while the remaining
    lawyer chose to go elsewhere. Because of the disbanding of REKO, Mr. Fantl
    was forced to decide what firm to retain to continue the matter. He chose
    REO because he knew and was a friend of Peter Roy, and because he had some
    experience with, and respected members of, the firm.  As such, he trusted
    them to carry the case forward.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Fantl served a notice of change of solicitors naming REO as counsel. KO brought
    a motion pursuant to s. 12 of the <i>Class Proceedings Act 1992</i>, S.O.
    1992, c.6 (the “CPA”), asking for various forms of relief, including an order
    striking the notice of change of solicitors and an order requiring Mr. Fantl
    to retain KO. In the alternative, KO sought to have Mr. Fantl removed as
    representative plaintiff and two new representative plaintiffs (Yi-Yea (Riya)
    Kang and Jeong-Ae Seok) substituted in his stead. The motion judge dismissed
    the motion in its entirety. KO appealed the decision of the motion judge
    to the
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court, which dismissed the appeal. KO appeals to this court, with
    leave. An expedited hearing was granted given that a settlement has been
    reached and the settlement approval hearing relating to the case is imminent. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge, in refusing to grant the relief requested, held that a representative
    plaintiff has a right to retain counsel of his or her choice. He found that
    the test to be applied in determining whether the plaintiff’s choice of counsel
    should stand is whether the counsel is adequate. Thus, he adopted the same
    test for counsel as is required by s. 5(1) of the CPA in determining whether
    a representative plaintiff may carry an action forward. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this context, the motion judge noted that while the court has a broad supervisory
    jurisdiction in class proceedings, it should not intervene in a plaintiff’s
    choice of counsel unless the choice would deny putative class members adequate
    legal representation. He rejected the appellant’s theory that the proper
    test to be applied is whether the plaintiff’s choice is in the best interests
    of the class. Hence, he refused to engage in a comparison of the two law
    firms to determine which group was superior. The
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court upheld the reasons of the motion judge on these central
    issues. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    the dismissal of the motion, KO brought a competing action against Transamerica,
    with Ms. Kang as the proposed representative plaintiff (the “Kang action”).
    The Kang action overlaps significantly with Mr. Fantl’s action. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant advances the same arguments on this appeal as were made to the
    courts below, contending that the motion judge erred by applying the wrong
    test. The competence of REO to act as class counsel is not in issue. This
    notwithstanding, on a comparison basis applying the test of best interests
    of the class, the appellant submits that the plaintiff ought to be directed
    to retain the KO firm. Consequently, the plaintiff’s choice of counsel ought
    to be set aside and new representative plaintiffs appointed in place of Mr.
    Fantl.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent submits that the motion judge applied the appropriate test and
    suggests that the key consideration in the analysis should be whether the
    plaintiff’s decision caused any prejudice to the class members. Since there
    is no dispute as to the competence of REO counsel, and since the settlement
    discussions have advanced to the point of a settlement approval hearing,
    the motion judge’s decision not to interfere with Mr. Fantl’s choice of counsel
    should be upheld.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    cannot accede to the appellant’s submissions. In my view, the representative
    plaintiff is entitled to select, and is indeed responsible for selecting,
    class counsel.  In a circumstance like this, when a decision properly comes
    before the supervisory court for review, the criteria to be considered in
    determining whether the plaintiff’s choice of counsel can stand are: competence
    of counsel; whether the choice was based on any improper considerations;
    and whether the choice resulted in any prejudice to the class. In the present
    case, competence of counsel is conceded. There is no evidence of any improper
    purpose in the selection of counsel or of any prejudice to the class as a
    result of that decision. Furthermore, the Kang action, commenced after the
    motion judge dismissed the appellant’s motion, is an abuse of process.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would dismiss the appeal, and exercise my discretion under s. 134(1) of the <i>Courts
    of Justice Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43 (the “CJA”) and s. 13 of the CPA,
    to stay the Kang action.  My reasons, which differ from those of the motion
    judge, follow.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>The Issues</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    are three central issues on this appeal.  First, is the representative plaintiff
    in an intended class proceeding, who is required to retain new counsel after
    the proceeding has been commenced, entitled to select counsel of his or her
    own choosing or is the court, in the exercise of its supervisory jurisdiction
    under the CPA, always required to approve class counsel? </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    regardless of the answer to the first question, if the selection of counsel
    comes before the court for review, what is the proper test to be applied
    in determining whether the plaintiff’s selection of class counsel should
    stand?  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    the appellant has asked this court to review whether Mr. Fantl should be
    replaced as the representative plaintiff. This requested relief bears on
    the status of a competing action, launched by the appellant following the
    dismissal of its motion, in which Ms. Kang is the representative plaintiff.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>Facts</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    appeal arises from a proposed class action against Transamerica that has
    yet to be certified. Mr. Fantl is not the original representative plaintiff
    in this action. The action was initially started by Michael Millman, a chartered
    accountant in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    British Columbia who owned an insurance policy issued by the company that
    is now Transamerica, and which contained an investment option known as the
    Can-Am Fund. Mr. Millman sought to sue Transamerica on the basis that: (1)
    Transamerica had overcharged him for management expenses; and (2) that the
    Can-Am fund had not tracked or replicated the results of the S&amp;P 500
    total return index as had been promised.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    lawyer retained by Mr. Millman referred the claims to Sutts, Strosberg LLP
    in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario for the purpose of commencing a class action. On
    <st1:date Month="12" Day="29"
Year="2003" w:st="on">
    December 29, 2003, a statement of claim was issued by Mr. Millman’s new counsel
    against Transamerica.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    there is disputed evidence as to the timing and roles of the parties, the
    motion judge found that by autumn 2005, the case had been transferred to
    the law firm REKO. He further found that, upon the transfer of the file,
    Mr. Kim became the supervising lawyer on the case. Shortly thereafter, Mr.
    Millman indicated that he was no longer prepared to act as the representative
    plaintiff in the case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Fantl was a long-standing friend of REKO partner Mr. Roy, and had been seeking
    legal advice from the firm on an unrelated matter at about the time that
    the original representative plaintiff removed himself from the file. During
    discussions, it emerged that Mr. Fantl was also an investor in the Can-Am
    Fund operated by Transamerica. REKO’s lawyers invited him to act as the new
    representative plaintiff in the action and he accepted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    May 2006, Mr. Fantl signed a retainer agreement with REKO. The retainer agreement
    was between Mr. Fantl and the law firm, and not between Mr. Fantl and any
    of REKO’s individual lawyers.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Between
    September 2005 and April 2007, the case progressed.  The statement of claim
    was amended, material for the certification was prepared and cross-examinations
    were conducted.  The certification motion did not proceed in May 2007, as
    scheduled, because Mr. Kim and counsel for Transamerica began to explore
    the idea of consent certification and a settlement of the management expenses
    claim.  The parties indicated in a case conference on September 12, 2007
    that there was a prospect of settlement but that the scope of the funds implicated
    in the claim was growing significantly, beyond just the Can-Am fund.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge found that Mr. Kim had been the partner at REKO with the most
    involvement in Mr. Fantl’s case, and that Mr. Kim had been assisted in this
    work to varying degrees by six associate lawyers. The motion judge also noted
    Mr. Fantl’s evidence that he had had minimal contact with Mr. Kim throughout
    the course of the class action and that Mr. Kim had not provided him with
    any reports or advice on the case, apart from one brief conversation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    reasons not disclosed to the motion judge, REKO dissolved on
    <st1:date Month="12" Day="31" Year="2007" w:st="on">
    December 31, 2007.  Mr. Kim established the firm now known as KO, and REKO’s
    other former partners established the new firm called REO. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Roy wrote to Mr. Fantl to inform him of REKO's dissolution and to seek instructions
    with respect to carriage of the class action.  On
    <st1:date Month="1" Day="5"
Year="2008" w:st="on">
    January 5, 2008, Mr. Fantl wrote to REO to say that he had chosen the firm
    to act as his lawyers for the class action.  He cited his “personal knowledge
    of Mr. Roy, his abilities and integrity as a lawyer and my confidence in
    his judgment” as among the reasons for his choice.  In this regard, the motion
    judge noted that Mr. Fantl had been the best man at Mr. Roy’s wedding. In
    his affidavit evidence, Mr. Fantl also noted that his choice of counsel was
    influenced by the fact that “REO has extensive class action experience and
    the senior partners have a great deal of experience in complex litigation,
    including settlement of complicated cases.” Mr. Fantl was not cross-examined
    on his affidavit. REO served the notice of change of solicitors and came
    on the record on
    <st1:date Month="1" Day="18" Year="2008" w:st="on">
    January 18, 2008.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>KO
    subsequently brought a motion to set aside the notice of change of solicitors,
    and to disqualify Mr. Fantl from being the representative plaintiff in the
    class action.  It argued before the motion judge that Mr. Fantl had breached
    his duty to the intended class members by choosing REO and that, based on
    the success and progress achieved by Mr. Kim in the action, it was in the
    best interests of the class that KO be appointed as solicitor of record.  KO
    also argued that, in the alternative, the court should replace Mr. Fantl
    with two new proposed representative plaintiffs, Ms. Seok and Ms. Kang. Mr.
    Fantl argued that the court’s jurisdiction to govern the solicitor-client
    relationship was limited to the post-certification phase and that, in any

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his reasons, the motion judge characterized the
    “overarching issue in the case” as being whether the court has the jurisdiction
    to supervise the relationships arising in a class proceeding, both pre- and
    post- certification: para. 56. He held that, on the basis of the court’s
    inherent jurisdiction to control its own process and the powers derived from   s.
    12 of the CPA, the court’s jurisdiction to supervise a class proceeding “exists
    from the outset of the litigation and the Court has the jurisdiction to make
    orders to protect putative class members as potential parties to the litigation”:
    para. 58. </p>

style='line-height:200%'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Having
    determined that the court has the jurisdiction to supervise all relationships
    arising out of a class proceeding from the outset of the litigation, the
    motion judge turned specifically to a consideration of the solicitor-client
    relationship. He recognized that in an ordinary action, well established
    principles dictate that a litigant has the autonomy to choose counsel without
    court interference. However, he noted that these principles cannot be transferred
    directly to the class action context due to the responsibilities owed by
    the representative plaintiff, class counsel and the court to absent class
    members. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge acknowledged previous case law suggesting that a solicitor-client
    relationship – with all its concomitant duties and obligations – may not
    exist between class counsel and proposed class members in the pre-certification
    stage. However, he held that a <i>sui generis</i> relationship exists between
    class counsel and proposed class members, and that at least some of the responsibilities
    inherent in the solicitor-client relationship are owed by counsel to the
    proposed class.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    considering the proper test for determining whether Mr. Fantl’s choice of
    counsel should stand, the motion judge reviewed the case law that had developed
    in relation to the adequacy of the representative plaintiff, carriage motions
    and the removal or change of counsel. Ultimately, he likened the fact situation
    of the instant case as being akin to that of choosing a solicitor of record
    at the outset of litigation. He thus applied the standard applied by the
    court on a certification motion: whether the representative plaintiff has
    selected “competent counsel that will adequately represent the proposed class
    if the action is certified”: para. 105. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    so deciding, the motion judge noted that this standard did not require the
    representative plaintiff to choose the best or more superior counsel. In
    this respect, while he stated that “Mr. Kim might or might not be a better
    choice”, Mr. Fantl’s choice of REO as solicitor of record met the standard
    of competency and adequacy: para. 110. Accordingly, the motion was dismissed.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>Positions of the Parties</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    thrust of the appellant’s argument is that, even though the litigation is
    being conducted by a representative or intended representative plaintiff,
    where a decision is required in the conduct of the proceeding, including
    one that occurs at the pre-certification stage, the decision of the plaintiff
    must receive the court’s approval. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant contends that this is necessitated by an overriding concern for
    the interests of the absent class members. Accordingly, in its submission,
    the test to be applied by the court is whether the decision made by the plaintiff
    is in the best interests of the class. This, says the appellant, is the test
    to be applied by a court throughout a class proceeding, regardless of the
    issue to be decided or the stage of the proceeding.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents advance a more limited view of the supervisory role of the court
    in the exercise of its jurisdiction under the CPA. They caution that it is
    not appropriate for the court to “descend into the arena” and assume the
    responsibility of the plaintiff in conducting the litigation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>Analysis</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addressing the issues raised in this appeal, I am guided by the reasons of
    the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Housen v. Nikolaisen</i>, [2002] 2 S.C.R.
    235, which sets out the standards of review in appeals from a judge’s order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>Issue 1:  Supervisory jurisdiction of the court</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is now well settled that class proceedings are <i>sui generis</i> litigation.
    In part, this is because of the existence of the proposed class in addition
    to the putative representative plaintiff. As stated by Cullity J. in <i>Heron
    v. Guidant Corp.</i>, [2007] O.J. No. 3823 (S.C.), leave to appeal refused
    (2008), 232 O.A.C. 366 (Div. Ct.), at para. 10:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>From the commencement of a class proceeding the
    court, as well as the named plaintiff has responsibilities to members of
    the class….They are not parties to the proceeding but they are not strangers.
    Their rights are as much at stake as those of the plaintiffs. It is consistent
    with their <i>sui generis</i> status, and the objectives of the CPA, that
    their interests should not be vulnerable to the deficiencies in the ability
    of the named plaintiff to represent them. [Citations omitted.]  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    existence of the absent class members, among other factors, is the reason
    that the court’s supervisory jurisdiction is engaged from the inception of
    an intended class proceeding. It continues throughout the
    “stages” of the proceeding until a final disposition, including the implementation
    of the administration of a settlement or, where applicable, a resolution
    of all individual issues. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    supervisory jurisdiction of the court over the class proceeding is not in
    issue on this appeal. The parties acknowledge that the court has supervisory
    jurisdiction throughout the proceeding. They do, however, posit markedly
    different theories as to the circumstances in which this jurisdiction must
    or ought to be exercised.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    I do not agree with the appellant’s position that the court must be actively
    engaged at every turn in the proceeding, I am equally circumspect about the “hands
    off” approach advocated by the respondents. Neither view accurately captures
    the role of the court in respect of a class proceeding. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    CPA is specific as to certain matters arising out of litigation conducted
    under the aegis of the statute that require court approval. These include, <i>inter
    alia</i>, the abandonment or discontinuance of an action, approval of settlements,
    notice to class members and class counsel fees: see ss. 29(1), 29(2), 20,
    and 32(2) of the CPA respectively. In addition to such enumerated and specific
    matters requiring court approval, the legislature has also seen fit to provide
    the court, under s. 12 of the CPA, with a broad, discretionary jurisdiction
    to
    “make any order it considers appropriate respecting the conduct of a class
    proceeding to ensure its fair and expeditious determination”.  Although the
    court’s ongoing supervisory jurisdiction is manifest in the CPA, this is
    not to say that every decision made by the plaintiff or counsel in the prosecution
    of the class action lawsuit requires the sanction of the court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion under appeal was brought pursuant to s. 12 of the CPA. The appellant
    argues that a notice of change of solicitors should not have been delivered
    without first obtaining an order of the court on motion brought by the representative
    plaintiff, so as to have the court approve the new class counsel.  Further,
    the appellant contends that this determination should only be made on the
    basis of the “best interests of the class”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    disagree. The position advanced by the appellant appears to be an attempt
    to combine certain developed principles of class action jurisprudence so
    as to elevate the court’s supervisory role over the proceeding to one of
    mandatory intervention. While it is true that the court has a responsibility
    to the absent class members, the prosecution of the action rests squarely
    with the representative plaintiff. The representative plaintiff in a class
    action lawsuit is a genuine plaintiff, who chooses, retains and instructs
    counsel and to whom counsel report. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is clear from a reading of the CPA. In order to obtain certification, s.
    5(1) of the CPA requires that the court be satisfied that the representative
    plaintiff “has produced a plan for the proceeding that sets out a workable
    method of advancing the proceeding on behalf of the class”. In other words,
    as stated by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Western Canadian Shopping
    Centres v. Dutton</i>, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 534,<i> </i>at para. 41: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In assessing whether the proposed representative
    is adequate, the court may look to the motivation of the representative,
    the competence of the representative's counsel, and the capacity of the representative
    to bear any costs that may be incurred by the representative in particular
    (as opposed to by counsel or by the class members generally). The proposed
    representative need not be &quot;typical&quot; of the class, nor the
    &quot;best&quot; possible representative. The court should be satisfied,
    however, that the proposed representative will vigorously and capably prosecute
    the interests of the class. [Citations omitted.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    is also stated in this passage, an important part of this representative
    plaintiff’s plan is the retention of “competent” counsel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not view it as necessary for the plaintiff to seek and obtain approval
    of the court for every decision involving the selection or change of counsel.
    However, I am of the view that the case management judge charged with responsibility
    for the supervision of the proceeding should be immediately and directly
    notified of such a change.  Further, if this decision is contested and properly
    comes before the court on motion, the court is well within its jurisdiction
    to review the plaintiff’s decision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>Issue 2: Test for reviewing a plaintiff’s choice
      of counsel </b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    parties vigorously disputed the test to be applied when the court reviews
    a representative plaintiff’s choice of counsel. In his reasons, the motion
    judge correctly identified the issues and canvassed the relevant case law
    in deciding that question. In my view, he made no error in holding that the
    choice of counsel upon REKO’s dissolution was a matter for Mr. Fantl to deal
    with and that his decision did not warrant interference by the court.  Nonetheless,
    I would arrive at that result for different reasons and based on a different
    analysis than that of the motion judge. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant has argued that this court should evaluate Mr. Fantl’s choice of
    counsel by determining whether he was acting in the “best interests of the
    class” in so choosing. On the other hand, the respondent contends that the
    motion judge was correct in applying a test of adequacy to Mr. Fantl’s choice
    of counsel. In my view, both approaches miss the mark. Once the court’s jurisdiction
    is engaged, any review by the court of a decision as to choice of counsel
    must be directed to three factors:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Has
    the plaintiff chosen competent counsel?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Were
    there any improper considerations underlying the choice made by the plaintiff?
    and </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Is
    there prejudice to the class as a result of the choice?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unless
    this inquiry reveals something unsatisfactory to the court, it ought not
    to interfere with the choice of counsel made by the plaintiff. The court
    is not a substitute decision maker for the plaintiff in the litigation. Accordingly,
    any intervention based on its supervisory jurisdiction must be limited to
    situations where there is cogent evidence that steps taken may have an adverse
    impact on the absent class members.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    formulating these criteria for review of the choice of counsel by the plaintiff,
    I am necessarily rejecting the argument of the appellant that the only test
    to be applied by the court is whether the choice is “in the best interests
    of the class”. It must be remembered that the broad and guiding “best interests” principle
    developed in recognition of the distinction that must be made between the
    interests of individual class members and the interests of the class as a
    whole when the court is considering certain issues: see <i>Parsons v. Canadian
    Red Cross Society</i> (1999), 40 C.P.C. (4<sup>th</sup>) 151 (Ont. S.C.), <i>Ford
    v. F. Hoffman-LaRoche Ltd. </i>(2005), 74 O.R. (3d) 758 (S.C.), and <i>Ontario
    New Home Warranty Program v. Chevron Chemical Co.</i> (1999), 46 O.R. (3d)
    130 (S.C.). Here, the context is very different. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    where the issue before the court is the plaintiff’s choice of counsel, insofar
    as the “interests of the class” must be considered, they are sufficiently
    addressed under the prejudice criterion. Where there is no prejudice, the
    choice of “competent counsel” who has not been selected for any improper
    purpose will also be in the interests of the class.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    applying these criteria, the court avoids the
    “contest” approach proposed by the appellant, which pits two sets of competing
    lawyers against each other and undermines the role of the representative
    plaintiff in selecting counsel. Such an approach is neither necessary nor
    productive where, as here, competence is conceded and there is no evidence
    that the plaintiff has acted improperly or in a manner that prejudices the
    interests of the class. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant contends that the “contest” approach is appropriate in the present
    circumstances because the choice of counsel is analogous to a carriage motion.
    I disagree. A carriage motion is a motion to determine which of two or more
    overlapping, competing intended class actions should be allowed to proceed
    and which should be stayed. A carriage motion involves a competition which,
    of necessity, requires a comparison of the competing proceedings.  Unlike
    a carriage motion, there is no competition between proceedings here. It is
    for this reason that any analogy between a carriage motion and the present
    circumstances breaks down. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><i>Application of the test to the instant case</i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    instant proceeding involves the choice of counsel upon dissolution of the
    class counsel law firm.  The retainer agreement was entered into between
    Mr. Fantl and REKO, and not with Mr. Kim or any other individual lawyer.
    A team of lawyers at the predecessor firm dealt with the case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    dissolution, some of the team formed the appellant, some formed REO and one
    lawyer joined another firm. Lawyers in each of these factions had participated
    in the work on the file to varying degrees. The lawyer who did the most work
    on the file was the associate who left and went to an unrelated firm.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    record indicates that, although Mr. Kim was the senior partner on the case,
    he did not take instructions from, or report to, Mr. Fantl, and that he only
    accompanied Mr. Fantl to cross-examinations. He attended one settlement meeting
    with the defendant at which defendant’s counsel offered to settle the claim,
    expand the class definition and communicate this development to class members. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the context of this file, and in the eyes of Mr. Fantl, there was more to
    the REKO firm than just Mr. Kim. Mr. Fantl was faced with three choices.
    He could go with the appellant, the REO firm or choose a different firm.
    He chose the REO firm. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that the failure to retain KO was akin to a dismissal of
    counsel. I do not accept this characterization of the facts before this court.
    The appellant was not terminated by the plaintiff. Indeed, KO had no relationship
    with the plaintiff capable of termination. Rather, its complaint is that
    the plaintiff did not choose to retain its lawyers after REKO’s dissolution.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning
    to the first factor of the test, competence of counsel of choice was conceded
    in the present case. I note the appellant’s submission that competence of
    counsel is not a useful benchmark since every lawyer in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario is competent and thus no motion challenging a plaintiff’s choice
    of counsel is likely to ever be successful. I disagree. Where competence
    is a live issue, the court should consider under this head:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='

    nature of the lawsuit;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    when considering competence of counsel, the court must take into account
    the fact that, after certification, class counsel will be in a solicitor-client
    relationship with the class members, with all of the responsibilities that
    entails, extending until the implementation of a settlement or final disposition
    of any individual issues. In other words, given that the class may include
    a large number of people, this obligation may be significant and prolonged:

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    criteria serve to advance an object of the CPA, namely to obtain first class

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning
    to the second factor, there is no evidence of any improper purpose or motive
    on the part of the plaintiff in making his decision to retain REO. The appellant
    points to the plaintiff’s friendship with Mr. Roy, one of the partners of
    REO, as the driving factor in choice of counsel. While that was a consideration,
    it was not the only factor for the plaintiff’s choice of counsel. As noted
    by the motion judge and as indicated in the record, Mr. Fantl was attracted
    to REO because of the competence of counsel, which is not disputed, and its
    reputation in class action work.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    any event, I would not accept that the fact of an acknowledged friendship
    between the plaintiff and his counsel of choice would constitute an improper
    purpose in and of itself. An improper purpose would be one where the plaintiff
    was seeking to gain a personal advantage, the hope of an advantage not shared
    by the class members or was motivated in some way that was inconsistent with
    the interests of the class. </p>

    to the third factor, to the extent that prejudice was argued by the appellant,
    this line of argument focused on the economic prejudice to the appellant
    rather than on any prejudice to the interests of the class.  The appellant
    emphasized what was characterized as the policy arguments in support of entrepreneurial
    lawyers, which were said to advance one of the goals of the CPA
    – access to justice. Effectively, the appellant’s argument is that it would
    be unfair for a plaintiff, upon dissolution of his or her counsel’s law firm,
    to choose any lawyer other than the lawyer who had previously acted as the
    lead counsel. In other words, in a class action, the lawyer’s time and effort
    on the file constitutes an equity investment by the lawyer in the case. It
    is argued that if representative plaintiffs are allowed to switch counsel
    at will, there will be less of an incentive for counsel to take on class
    actions and make an investment of time and effort that may be lost.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is no question that class proceedings are entrepreneurial in nature. However,
    the proposition advanced by the appellant would only be supportable if the
    creation of an entrepreneurial class action bar was a policy goal underpinning
    the CPA. This argument fails because as far as the CPA is concerned, the
    entrepreneurial lawyer is a means to an end, not an end in and of itself.
    Were it otherwise, one of the criticisms of the CPA, that it promulgates
    plaintiff-less litigation benefiting only the lawyers involved, would be
    well founded. Such is not the case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sections
    33(1) and (4) of the CPA, which provide for contingency fees and a multiplier
    effect on fees to reward risk and success, are intended to provide sufficient
    incentives for lawyers to take on class proceedings that would not otherwise
    be attractive. This is the entrepreneurial aspect of class proceedings legislation
    that enhances access to justice. The CPA does not, nor was it ever intended
    to, provide lawyers with a vested interest in the subject matter of the lawsuit
    entitling them to override the choices of the representative plaintiff in
    the litigation, including the choice of counsel. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    any event, Mr. Kim’s investment of time and effort in the action while at
    REKO&nbsp;will be protected through the process of dissolving that firm.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    conclusion, in light of the three factors set out above, namely, that competence
    of counsel is not in issue, there is no evidence of any improper purpose
    or considerations in choice of counsel, and no demonstrated prejudice to
    the class, there is no reason to interfere with the choice of counsel by
    Mr. Fantl.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>Issue 3: Substitution of the representative plaintiff
      and the status of the Kang action<i></i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    Perell J., the appellant sought an order adding Ms. Seok and Ms. Kang as
    potential representative plaintiffs to replace Mr. Fantl as the plaintiff.  Perell
    J. denied its request.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    appeal, the appellant argued that Mr. Fantl’s decision not to retain the
    appellant, in the face of Mr. Kim’s success on the file, suggests that Mr.
    Fantl will not best represent the class members, and, thus, ought to be removed.
    On behalf of Ms. Kang and Ms. Seok, it argued that they should be substituted
    as representative plaintiffs. The respondents opposed, saying that, as with
    the commencement of the Kang action, this is simply an attempt to determine
    who will represent the interests of the class.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Fantl has prosecuted the action to the point of settlement. There is no suggestion
    that he has been less than diligent in this respect. Indeed, Mr. Fantl stepped
    in to represent the class when the original representative plaintiff chose
    to abandon that role. He did so after being approached by solicitors from
    REKO, some of whom now stand with opposing interests on this appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    not necessarily determinative, the choice to approach Mr. Fantl to act in
    the representative capacity indicates that none of the counsel had any concerns
    about his ability to perform that role at that time. Moreover, when the plaintiff
    assumed the representation of the class, it must have been implicitly understood
    by his solicitors that he would be the one providing instructions for the
    litigation of the action. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    light of these factors and my conclusion above that Mr. Fantl chose competent
    counsel, did not act with an improper purpose or act to the prejudice of
    the class, there is no basis to interfere with the decision of the motion
    judge not to remove or replace Mr. Fantl as the representative plaintiff
    in this action. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><i>Stay of Kang Action</i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant commenced the Kang action following the dismissal of the motion
    to strike the notice of change of solicitors and replace the representative
    plaintiff, notwithstanding its admission before the motion judge that such
    a move would be “disingenuous”: para. 99. Indeed, the
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court commented on this development in the following terms at
    para. 11 of its reasons: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Most remarkable of all, and independent of this
    motion under appeal, the lawyer has started a separate class proceeding against
    Transamerica in the name of Ms. Kang, the proposed representative plaintiff.  This
    is the same Ms. Kang whom the lawyer seeks to have added as representative
    plaintiff with Mr. Fantl, or, in the alternative, to replace Mr. Fantl, his
    former client, with Ms. Kang and Ms. Seok.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the observation of the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court that the bringing of the Kang action after having lost the
    motion before the motion judge was “most remarkable”. The only purpose for
    doing this can be to provide a platform for a carriage motion to challenge
    the instant proceeding as the proper proceeding to take the action forward
    to settlement on behalf of the class.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Apart
    from the fact that the appellant brought the second duplicative proceeding,
    which would in my view be determinative in and of itself, a carriage motion
    would also involve the appellant in bringing a proceeding against its former
    client. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    essence of the respondents’ argument is that the Kang action amounts to an
    abuse of process. I agree. Accordingly, pursuant to the jurisdiction conferred
    upon this court under s. 134(1) of the CJA and s. 13 of the CPA, I would
    stay the Kang action.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    allowed to proceed, the Kang action would inevitably be stayed in any event.
    Considering the factors outlined by Cumming J. in <i>Vitapharm Canada Ltd.
    v. F. Hoffman-Laroche Ltd.</i> (2000), 4 C.P.C. (5<sup>th</sup>) 169 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Ont.
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    S.C.), at para. 49, there is no question that Mr. Fantl’s action would proceed
    over the Kang action given that it is so “significantly more advanced than
    the other”: <i>Setterington v. Merck-Frosst Canada Ltd.</i> (2006), 26 C.P.C.
    (6<sup>th</sup>) 173 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">

    C.P.C. (5<sup>th</sup>) 297 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    as this action is on the cusp of settlement, the delay caused by a carriage
    motion would only serve to postpone the class members’ access to justice.
    Even the appellant recognized that time was of the essence in this case,
    given the imminent settlement approval hearing, when it sought and was granted
    an expedited hearing of this appeal. Therefore, regardless of whether the
    competing actions are analyzed through the lens of best interests of the
    class or through that of prejudice, I reach the same inevitable conclusion
    that the Kang action should be stayed.  The class members are entitled to
    certainty.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>Conclusion </b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    conclusion, I would dismiss the appeal. Further, I would grant a stay of
    the Kang action. Mr. Fantl shall receive costs of $10,000 for the appeal
    and $5,000 for the leave motion inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T. The
    appellant shall also pay to Transamerica its costs of $6,350 for the appeal
    and $2,000 for the leave motion, inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T. </p>
