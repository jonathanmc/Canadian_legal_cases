    Ontario moved to strike out the fresh as amended statement of claim (the “claim”)
    at the pleading stage on the ground that the province did not owe the plaintiff
    a private law duty of care.  The motion judge, relying on the decision of
    the Divisional Court in <i>Eliopoulos (Litigation Trustee of) v. Ontario
    (Minister of Health and Long-Term Care</i>) (2005), 76 O.R. (3d) 36, where
    it held that Ontario could be liable to those who contracted West Nile virus,
    struck out portions of the claim but refused to strike it out entirely.  The
    Divisional Court’s <i>Eliopoulos</i> judgment was later reversed by this
    court which held that while Ontario did owe a public law duty to promote
    health and protect against the spread of the West Nile virus, there was no
    relationship of proximity between the plaintiff and Ontario capable of giving
    rise to a private law duty of care: (2006), 82 O.R. (3d) 321 (“<i>Eliopoulos</i>”).  The
    Supreme Court of Canada refused leave to appeal: <span style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none;text-underline:

    plaintiff appeals the order striking out portions of the claim. Ontario cross-appeals
    the order refusing to strike the claim in its entirety arguing that this
    case cannot be distinguished from <i>Eliopoulos</i> and that it is “plain
    and obvious” that the claim as pleaded cannot succeed. </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is a proposed class action.  The claim alleges that
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario learned of the outbreak of SARS in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">China</st1:country-region>
    in mid-February 2003 and that the first case of SARS in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Toronto occurred in late February.  By mid-March a cluster of SARS cases
    had been identified in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto and as a result, on March 23, 2003,
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    Scarborough
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Grace
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Hospital closed its emergency room.  On March 25, 2003, the Minister of Health
    declared SARS a reportable, communicable disease under the<i> Health Protection
    and Promotion Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.7 (“<i>HPPA</i>”), and on March
    26, 2003, the Premier of Ontario declared SARS a provincial emergency pursuant
    to the <i>Emergency Management Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. E.9, as am. by S.O.
    2002, c. 14 (“<i>EMA</i>”).
     Also on March 26, 2003, the Minister of Health ordered hospitals in the
    Greater Toronto Area to activate “Code Orange”
    emergency plans, under which only essential services were to be offered.  
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario issued a series of Directives to hospitals to limit non-urgent care,
    to control the entrance and movement of staff and patients within health
    care facilities, to require protective measures and gear, to provide for
    reporting of suspected SARS cases, and to create isolation areas for SARS
    patients. </p>

    Ontario began to relax the infection control imposed on hospitals.  The plaintiff
    alleges that
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario knew or should have known that failure to eradicate SARS completely
    would result in a recurrence of the disease.  The plaintiff further alleges
    that

    (“WHO”) warning to travelers to avoid
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    Toronto, issued on April 23, 2003.  The WHO travel warning was lifted on

    of emergency. </p>

    plaintiff alleges that the easing of infection control procedures was premature
    and led to the second outbreak of SARS on or about April 20, 2003.  She pleads
    that she contracted SARS while she was a surgery patient at
    <st1:place

    Ontario announced that SARS had not been completely contained, and shortly
    thereafter all hospitals in the Greater Toronto Area were ordered to reinstate

    rise to a duty of care, a duty of care is thereby established, and it is
    unnecessary to engage in the two step <i>Cooper-Anns</i> test: <i>Childs
    v. Desormeaux</i>, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 643, at para. 15 (“<i>Desormeaux</i>”).  If
    the proposed duty of care has not been recognized, then the <i>Cooper-Anns</i> test
    is used to determine whether the novel duty should be given legal recognition.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The <i>Cooper-Anns</i> test
    consists of two stages.  The first stage, which determines whether the relationship
    between the parties justifies the imposition of a duty of care on the defendant,
    involves consideration of foreseeability, proximity and policy. For a duty
    of care to arise, more is required than foreseeability - the two parties
    must also be sufficiently proximate to one another: <i>Desormeaux</i> at
    para. 12.  Proximity, explained the court in <i>Cooper</i> at para. 31, “is
    generally used in the authorities to characterize the type of relationship
    in which a duty of care may arise.”  Two parties are in proximity with one
    another if their relationship is sufficiently close and direct that it is
    fair to require the defendant to be mindful of the legitimate interests of
    the plaintiff: <i>Cooper</i> at paras. 32-34.   The evaluation of whether
    a relationship is sufficiently proximate to ground a duty of care entails
    a consideration of the
    “expectations, representations, reliance, and the property or other interests
    involved. Essentially…factors that allow us to evaluate the closeness of
    the relationship between the plaintiff and the defendant and to determine
    whether it is just and fair having regard to that relationship to impose
    a duty of care”: <i>Cooper </i>at para. 34.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    a number of different factors may be helpful in determining whether proximity
    exists between two parties, the Supreme Court has stated that proximity is
    not defined by any “single unifying characteristic”, nor is there a clear
    test to be applied to determine whether proximity exists in a given case: <i>Cooper</i> at
    para. 35.  In <i>Cooper</i>, the court held that the statutory duty imposed
    on the Registrar of Mortgage Brokers to oversee the conduct of mortgage brokers
    was owed to the public as a whole, rather than to individual mortgage investors.  While
    losses to investors were reasonably foreseeable from carelessness in carrying
    out the Registrar’s duties, there was nothing in the statute or in the relationship
    between individual investors and the regulator to create the required element
    of proximity.  In a companion case, <i>Edwards v. Law Society of Upper Canada</i>,
    [2001] 3 S.C.R. 562 (“<i>Edwards</i>”), the court rejected on similar grounds
    the proposition that the body given power to regulate the legal profession
    in Ontario owed a duty of care to individuals who had entrusted funds to
    an errant solicitor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    both stages, the <i>Cooper-Anns</i> test involves looking at policy reasons
    for refusing to impose a duty of care on the defendant.  At the first stage,
    when determining whether to recognize a prima facie duty of care, the policy
    reasons must arise from the nature of the relationship between the parties,
    rather than any external concerns, which are not considered until the second
    stage of the test: <i>Cooper</i> at para. 30.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    the first stage of the <i>Cooper-Anns test</i> is met, the plaintiff has
    established a <i>prima facie</i> duty of care owed by the defendant and the
    analysis proceeds to the second stage.  It is here that the court considers
    whether there are “residual policy considerations” that militate against
    recognizing a novel duty of care: <i>Cooper </i>at para. 30.  These are policy
    considerations that
    “are not concerned with the relationship between the parties, but with the
    effect of recognizing a duty of care on other legal obligations, the legal
    system and society more generally”: <i>Cooper </i>at para. 37.  One such
    residual policy concern is the need to immunize the policy decisions of the
    government from tort liability: <i>Cooper</i> at para. 38.  Policy decisions,
    as contrasted with operational decisions, are based on social, political
    or economic factors: <i>Swinamer v.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Nova Scotia (Attorney General)</i>, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 445, at p. 455 (“<i>Swinamer</i>”).  Determining
    whether a governmental decision is a policy decision requires evaluating
    the nature of the decision itself, rather than the identity of the actors: <i>Swinamer</i> at
    p. 457.</p>
  <h3><i>(a) Does the case fall within a recognized category?</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    plaintiff submits that the case as pleaded falls into the existing category
    of “negligence causing physical harm to person or property” and that accordingly,
    it is unnecessary to engage in a full <i>Cooper-Anns</i> analysis.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the category advanced by the plaintiff is cast at such a level of
    generality that it fails to provide sufficient analytic content capable of
    obviating the need for a full <i>Cooper-Anns</i> analysis.  As <i>Eliopoulos</i> and <i>Attis
    v. Canada (Minister of Health) </i>(2008), 93 O.R. (3d) 35 (C.A.), leave
    to appeal to S.C.C. refused [2008] S.C.C.A. No. 491 (“<i>Attis</i>”), demonstrate,
    the proximity analysis cannot be short-circuited by focusing simply on the
    fact that the plaintiff has alleged that the defendant’s negligence has resulted
    in physical harm to plaintiff’s person or property.  This is especially so
    in cases where the defendant did not create the risk that actually caused
    the harm, and the alleged negligence consists of a failure to take adequate
    steps to prevent physical harm arising from the external or existing risk:
    see <i>Desormeaux</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,

    issued by
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    West Nile prevention plan at issue in <i>Eliopoulos</i>, and that unlike
    the plan in <i>Eliopoulos</i>, the Directives here were cast in mandatory
    terms.  However, I am not persuaded that this case can be distinguished from <i>Eliopoulos</i> simply
    due to the detailed and mandatory nature of the Directives, or that these
    differences have any bearing on the issue of proximity. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is clear from <i>Cooper</i>, at para. 43, that as the claim is against a
    public authority exercising statutory powers, the starting point for analysis
    is the statutory scheme.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black;'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Directives were issued by the Chief Medical Officer of Health under powers
    conferred by the <i>Health Protection and Promotion Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990,
    c. H.7, (“<i>HPPA</i>”) ss. 24 and 86 (see now s. 77.7(1)).  The nature of
    the statutory powers conferred by the <i>HPPA</i> in relation to the promotion
    of public health and the control of infectious diseases was considered at
    length in <i>Eliopoulos</i>.
     After considering the <i>Cooper-Anns</i> test, this court held, at paras.
    17-19, that the exercise of the extensive discretionary powers to take measures
    to protect the public from the spread of infectious disease did not create
    a private law duty in that case.  The powers<span style='color:black;'> “are
    to be exercised…in the general public interest” and they “are not aimed at
    or geared to the protection of the private interests of specific individuals”.  While
    the Minister of Health is under a general public law duty “to promote, safeguard
    and protect the health of Ontario residents and prevent the spread of infectious
    diseases…a general public law duty of that nature does not give rise to a
    private law duty sufficient to ground an action in negligence.”  Rather,
    the Minister is required to act in the general public interest, and in so
    doing must balance “a myriad of competing interests”, the nature of which
    are inconsistent with the imposition of a private law duty of care. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    so concluding, the court referred to the decisions of the Supreme Court of
    Canada in <i>Cooper</i> and <i>Edwards</i>, at paras. 18-20:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Cooper</i> and <i>Edwards</i> are
    particularly instructive. Both cases centred on claims by a specific class
    of individuals who alleged that they had suffered loss as a result of the
    failure of a public authority to exercise its supervisory and investigatory
    powers. <i>Cooper</i> involved a claim by investors who suffered losses at
    the hands of a mortgage broker.  The plaintiffs alleged that the British
    Columbia Registrar of Mortgage Brokers owed them a private law duty to suspend
    a mortgage broker's licence or to notify investors if a mortgage broker was
    under investigation. In <i>Edwards</i>, the plaintiffs suffered losses at
    the hands of a lawyer who allegedly used his trust account improperly.  The
    plaintiffs alleged that the Law Society of Upper Canada, which had knowledge
    of the manner in which the lawyer operated his trust account, owed them a
    private law duty to ensure that the lawyer's trust account was operated according
    to the regulations or to warn the plaintiffs that it had abandoned its investigation.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In both <i>Cooper</i> and <i>Edwards</i>, the statements
    of claim were struck because the public authority owed no private law duty
    of care to the plaintiffs. In both cases, after reviewing the statutory powers
    and duties of the defendant, the Supreme Court concluded that any duty was
    owed to the public as a whole rather than to individual investors or clients
    who interacted with the brokers or lawyers regulated by the legislation.
    In <i>Cooper</i>, the Supreme Court concluded, at para. 49:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>Even though to some degree the provisions of
    the Act serve to protect the interests of investors, the overall scheme of
    the Act mandates that the Registrar's duty of care is not owed to investors
    exclusively but to the public as a whole. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>Similarly in <i>Edwards</i>, the Supreme Court found,
    at para. 14:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The <i>Law Society Act</i> is geared for the protection
    of clients and thereby the public as a whole, it does not mean that the Law
    Society owes a private law duty of care to a member of the public who deposits
    money into a solicitor's trust account. Decisions made by the Law Society
    require the exercise of legislatively delegated discretion and involve pursuing
    a myriad of objectives consistent with public rather than private law duties.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>As I see it, the proximity argument in this case
    is significantly weaker than in either <i>Cooper</i> or <i>Edwards</i>.  Those
    cases pertained to narrow classes of individuals whose specific interests
    were vulnerable to the very agents the public authorities were mandated to
    supervise, yet no duty of care was found.  This case is concerned with a
    general risk faced by all members of the public and a public authority mandated
    to promote and protect the health of everyone located in its jurisdiction.  The
    risk of contracting a disease that might have been prevented by public health
    authorities is a risk that is faced by the public at large. It is a much
    more generalized risk than the type faced by mortgage investors or clients
    of lawyers.  Moreover, the nexus or relationship between a member of the
    public who contracts [West Nile Virus] and the Minister is more attenuated
    than the nexus or relationship between a mortgage investor and the regulator
    of mortgage brokers or a client and the regulator of the legal profession.  It
    was held to be plain and obvious in <i>Cooper</i> and <i>Edwards</i> that
    there could be no private law duty of care and I find it impossible to conclude
    otherwise in this case.<b><u></u></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Two
    subsequent decisions of this court came to the same conclusion in relation
    to statements of claim alleging a private law duty of care on the part of
    a public authority charged with the statutory responsibility of monitoring
    the quality of certain medical devices.  In <i>Attis</i>, the court considered
    a claim against Heath
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    for its alleged failure to test, ban or recall certain breast implants that
    allegedly caused harm to the plaintiffs.  <i>Drady v. Canada (Minister of
    Health)</i> (2008), 300 D.L.R. (4th) 443 (Ont. C.A.), leave to appeal to
    S.C.C. refused [2008] S.C.C.A. No. 492, dealt with a similar claim against
    the same defendant for failing to enforce labeling and regulatory standards
    in relation to temporomandibular joint implants.  In <i>Attis</i>, Lang J.A.
    held, at para. 59, that “the government’s duty is owed to the public as a
    whole, not to the individual consumer.”  Likewise, in <i>Drady</i>, she concluded
    at para 38: “While undoubtedly Health Canada owed a public law duty of care
    to the residents of Canada generally, the law is clear that a breach of such
    a public law duty does not give rise to a private law cause of action.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    allegations made regarding decisions and actions taken by Ontario in relation
    to the SARS outbreak fall into the same category as those made and dismissed
    as disclosing no cause of action in <i>Cooper</i>, <i>Edwards</i>, <i>Eliopoulos</i>, <i>Attis</i> and <i>Drady</i>.  The
    Directives mandated standards to be followed and implemented by heath care
    facilities and health care professionals.  It is simply not arguable in law
    that by promulgating these quasi-legislative standards to hospitals and health
    care workers,
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario created a relationship of proximity with the plaintiff sufficient
    to give rise to a private law duty of care. In addition the cases already
    referred to, see <i>Wellbridge Holdings Ltd. v.

      distinguishable from the case at hand because:</p>

      SARS virus can only be spread by close person to person contact, and so

      plaintiff therefore was not exposed to a general risk to the public at
      large but to “a very specific risk particular to her and a limited class

      in close contact with the first three groups.”</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    disagree that the nature of SARS and how it is spread is capable of distinguishing
    this case from <i>Eliopoulos</i>, and even less from <i>Cooper</i> and <i>Edwards</i>.  The
    risk of contracting an infectious disease from attending a hospital for treatment
    or to visit a loved one was a random risk facing the public at large.  While
    it may be that in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario mosquitoes are more frequently encountered than trips to the hospital,
    when it comes to assessing the proximity between the province and an individual
    infected by reason of one or the other, I see no meaningful distinction between
    the two.  The fact that the plaintiff contracted SARS while she was in the
    hospital does not put her in a narrow class of individuals in a direct relationship
    with
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario.  Moreover, as in <i>Eliopoulos</i>, the proximity between the province
    and one who happens to visit a hospital is considerably more remote than
    the proximity between individuals dealing with lawyers and mortgage brokers
    and the public authorities charged with the duty to regulate and monitor
    those very dealings, as in <i>Cooper </i>and <i>Edwards</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black;'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When
    assessing how best to deal with the SARS outbreak, Ontario was required to
    address the interests of the public at large rather than focus on the particular
    interests of the plaintiff or other individuals in her situation.  Decisions
    relating to the imposition, lifting or re-introduction of measures to combat
    SARS are clear examples of decisions that must be made on the basis of the
    general public interest rather than on the basis of the interests of a narrow
    class of individuals.  Restrictions limiting access to hospitals or parts
    of hospitals may help combat the spread of disease, but such restrictions
    will also have an impact upon the interests of those who require access to
    the hospital for other heath care needs or those of relatives and friends.  Similarly,
    a decision to lift restrictions may increase the risk of the disease spreading
    but may offer other advantages to the public at large including enhanced
    access to heath care facilities.  The public officials charged with the responsibility
    for imposing and lifting such measures must weigh and balance the advantages
    and disadvantages and strive to act in a manner that best meets the overall
    interests of the public at large.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    plaintiff submits that the decisions in <i>Eliopoulos</i>, <i>Cooper</i> and <i>Edwards</i> must
    now be read in the light of <i>Sauer v. Canada (Attorney General)</i> (2007),
    225 O.A.C. 143 (C.A.) (“<i>Sauer</i>”), and <i>Finney v. Barreau du Québec, </i>[2004]
    2 S.C.R. 17 (“<i>Finney</i>”).  I see nothing in either of those decisions
    capable of detracting from the applicability of <i>Eliopoulos,</i> <i>Cooper</i> and <i>Edwards </i>to
    the facts of this case, as<i> </i>both of those cases involved specific allegations
    that Crown authorities had direct dealings with the plaintiff sufficient
    to give rise to a private law duty of care.<i>   </i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><i>Sauer</i> involved
    a proposed class action by cattle farmers against the federal Crown alleging
    negligence in the regulation of bovine spongiform encephalopathy.  The plaintiff
    alleged that the federal authorities had represented to members of the proposed
    class that they would protect the private interests of cattle farmers, and
    that it was therefore arguable that federal authorities had entered into
    a relationship of proximity and were acting with the interests of the plaintiff
    class in mind rather than in the broad public interest: see <i>Attis</i> at
    para. 49.  In <i>Finney</i>, the plaintiff, who sued the Barreau du Québec
    for its failure to deal with an errant member, had directly engaged with
    the Barreau by complaining about the actions of the member.  The Barreau
    failed to deal with those specific complaints in a proper and timely manner.  The
    actions of the Barreau were described as
    “made in a relationship of proximity with a clearly identified complainant”: <i>Finney</i> at
    para. 46.  Here, no facts are pleaded to suggest that the plaintiff had any
    direct contact or dealings with

    for me to consider the second stage of the <i>Cooper-Anns</i> test.  I would
    observe, however, that when it comes to residual policy concerns, it is difficult
    to see any meaningful distinction between this case and <i>Eliopoulos,</i> where
    the court concluded, at paras. 32-33:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In deciding how to protect its citizens from risks

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I agree with

    on alleged negligence “involving, or calling for, policy decisions”, those
    allegations could not be saved by “the unparticularized assertion that…[the
    policy decisions] were made irrationally or in bad faith”.  I agree with
    and adopt that analysis. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Several
    recent decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada and of this court recognize
    that it is appropriate to analyze claims alleging negligence against public
    authorities based on the exercise of discretionary statutory duties at the
    pleading stage to determine whether there is any possibility that a duty
    of care could be found to exist: <i>Cooper</i>; <i>Edwards</i>; <i>Syl Apps
    Secure Treatment Centre v. B.D.</i>,<i> </i>[2007] 3 S.C.R. 83; <i>Eliopoulos</i>; <i>Attis</i>; <i>Drady</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the foregoing reasons, I conclude that it is plain and obvious on the facts
    pleaded in the claim that
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario did not owe a private law duty of care to the plaintiff and that,
    in law, this claim has no prospect of success. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I would dismiss the plaintiff’s appeal, allow
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario’s cross-appeal, strike the claim in its entirety and dismiss the
    action. If the parties are unable to agree as to costs, we will receive brief
    written submissions, from
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario within fifteen days and from the plaintiff within ten days thereafter. </p>
