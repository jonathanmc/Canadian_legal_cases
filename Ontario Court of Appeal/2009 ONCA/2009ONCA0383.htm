      August 2, 2002 the plaintiff was a passenger in a boat being operated by
      the defendant Sullivan when it was struck by another boat operated by the
      defendant Roberts.  As the result of that collision the plaintiff suffered
      injuries.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

      March 20, 2006 the plaintiff entered into a form of MCA with the defendant
      Roberts.  In accordance with the terms of that agreement, Roberts paid
      to the plaintiff the total sum of $438,000 including $35,000 for legal
      fees inclusive of GST, and $38,000 for disbursements also inclusive of
      GST.</span></p>

      at $312,021.00 and found the plaintiff 11% contributorily negligent for
      such damages and assessed the remaining liability 50% against Roberts and
      39% against Sullivan.</span></p>

  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rick
    Laudon, the plaintiff, commenced an action against Will Roberts and Keith
    Sullivan, the defendants, after he was injured in a boating accident. Roberts
    and Sullivan separately defended the action and cross claimed against each
    other.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    March, 2006, the plaintiff settled the claim against Roberts for $365,000
    inclusive of damages and interest. The terms of the settlement did not require
    the plaintiff to repay any part of this settlement, regardless of the jury’s
    verdict. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial commenced in early October, 2006. At the outset of the trial, the parties
    advised the trial judge of the settlement with Roberts; however, the amount
    of the settlement ($365,000) was to remain undisclosed until the jury rendered
    its verdict. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    October 11, 2006, the parties asked the trial judge to rule on an issue of
    law, namely whether the amount paid by Roberts in settlement of the action
    must be deducted from the damages assessed by the jury. The trial judge ruled
    that it should not be deducted. On October 18, 2006, the trial judge ordered
    a dismissal of Sullivan’s and Roberts’ cross claims against each other on
    consent. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the outset of the continuation of the trial in April, 2007, Sullivan advised
    the trial judge and Roberts that he intended to move to set aside the ruling
    of October 11, 2006 on the ground that relevant case law had not been before
    the court. The motion was heard on consent of the parties on May 10, 2007.
    However, the trial judge denied leave pursuant to his earlier order on October
    19, 2006 in which he stipulated that no motions would be permitted prior
    to the trial without leave of the court, such leave to be sought no later
    than 60 days before the commencement of the trial. He noted that granting
    leave to bring the motion would potentially prejudice the plaintiff.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    the trial, the jury apportioned liability as follows: Sullivan – 39%; Roberts – 50%
    and the plaintiff 11%. Total damages were awarded at $312,021 ($277,698 net
    of the plaintiff’s contributory negligence). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    plaintiff’s motion for judgment in accordance with the jury’s verdict was
    opposed by the defendant Sullivan on the basis that having received $365,000
    from Roberts, the plaintiff had been fully compensated for his loss. The
    trial judge granted the motion for judgment and, after factoring in prejudgment
    interest, entered judgment against Sullivan in the amount of $144,464.</p>

      say that the deductibility of the money paid to the plaintiff by the defendant
      Roberts pursuant to the MCA was decided by the trial judge at the outset
      of the trial in his ruling dated October 12, 2006 and that the Notice of
      Appeal, having been filed April 16, 2008, is out of time.  They submit
      the appeal should be quashed on this basis.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>After
      a jury had been selected and before evidence was called the appellant brought
      a motion before the trial judge for “a determination as to what effect
      the agreement has on the plaintiff’s recovery against the defendant Sullivan.”  At
      this point in time there was of course no verdict.  No findings of liability
      had been made.  The various scenarios put to the trial judge could only
      be hypothetical.  Nevertheless the ruling was made that the agreement between
      Roberts and the plaintiff did not affect what amount Sullivan would be
      obliged to pay the plaintiff.  The trial judge noted:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>…
    I reject the proposition that the non-contributing party can rely upon the
        agreement between Roberts and Laudon so that Sullivan will not be held
        liable to the plaintiff for any damages unless the jury assesses Laudon’s
        damages at more than the amount paid by Roberts under the agreement.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
      the 18<sup>th</sup> of October, 2006 the trial judge decided further motions
      relating to Roberts’ participation in the trial and limited his participation
      as set out in those reasons.  Because there was insufficient time remaining
      in the sittings to complete the case, on October 19, 2006 the case was
      adjourned to April 10, 2007.  The jury that had been selected on October
      10, 2006 was discharged.</span></p>

      May, 2007 after the trial was well underway, the appellant Sullivan moved
      to have the trial judge reconsider his ruling made October 12, 2006. The
      appellant submitted that in making his ruling on October 12, 2006, the
      trial judge was not provided with relevant and binding authority on point.  The
      trial judge refused to reconsider his ruling on several bases including
      the fact that he had already decided the issue.</span></p>

      November 21, 2007, the verdict of the jury was received and when the plaintiff
      moved for judgment in accordance with the verdict the appellant Sullivan
      objected.  He argued that because the plaintiff had not recovered more
      at trial than he had been paid pursuant to the MCA, the action should be
      dismissed against Sullivan and that Sullivan should have his costs against
      the plaintiff.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge rejected Sullivan’s argument and found that his ruling of October
      12, 2006 was dispositive of the issue and that the authorities submitted
      to him since that ruling did not alter his conclusion.  Judgment was granted
      in accordance with the verdict of the jury, the terms of which required
      Sullivan to pay the plaintiff 39% of the damages awarded. It is from this
      judgment that the appellant appeals.</span></p>

      my view the motion brought at the outset of trial and which resulted in
      the October 12, 2006 ruling was premature.  At that point in time the trial
      had not yet begun and all that was required was full disclosure of the
      agreement,<a

      this occurs, a trial judge will then consider the nature of the participation

      be placed on that participation.</span></p>

      is not appropriate, before the trial has begun and before any damage assessment
      has been made, to make any order in relation to the deductibility of the
      amount paid to the plaintiff pursuant to a MCA.  The time for that order
      to be made is after the jury’s verdict has been received or, in a judge
      alone trial, after judgment assessing the damages has been received.  Until
      then, the issue of deductibility can only be hypothetical.<a

      can be no question that a trial judge has full authority, during the course
      of a trial, to revisit rulings made earlier in the proceedings and there
      may be any number of reasons for so doing.  In view of that jurisdiction,
      it is my view that rulings made intra-trial do not become final for the
      purposes of appeal until judgment has been entered.  Such an approach is
      a sensible one which would preclude litigants having to adjourn trial proceedings
      mid-stream, as it were, to appeal particular rulings. The time-honoured
      practice of reserving to the conclusion of trial the appeal of various
      rulings made during the proceedings is sound in that it preserves court
      time and costs. For examples of this practice see: <i>Khan v. Pfuegel</i> (1984),

      plaintiff should be neither over nor under, but fully compensated by way
      of damages for injury sustained by the negligence of others.  McLachlin
      J. writing for the majority in <i>Ratych v. Bloomer</i>, [1990] 1 S.C.R.
      940 at paragraph 94 put it this way:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The general principles underlying
      our system of damages suggest that a plaintiff should receive full and
      fair compensation, calculated to place him or her in the same position
      as he or she would have been had the tort not been committed, in so far
      as this can be achieved by a monetary award.  This principle suggests that
      in calculating damages under the pecuniary heads, the measure of damages
      should be the plaintiff’s actual loss.  It is implicit in this that the
      plaintiff should not recover unless he can demonstrate a loss, and then
      only to the extent of that loss.  Double recovery violates this principle.</span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The respondent, a police officer,
      was injured in a motor vehicle accident involving the police cruiser he
      was driving and a vehicle driven by the appellant.  He was unable to work
      for several months because of his injuries but continued to be paid pursuant
      to the terms of his collective agreement and did not lose any accumulated “sick
      credits”. The respondent successfully sued the appellant for damages for
      lost wages.  The trial judge and the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">

    Divisional Court both found that they were bound by a decision of the Ontario
    Court of Appeal (<i>Boarelli v. Flannigan </i>(1973), 36 D.L.R. (3d) 4).
    The Court of Appeal refused leave to appeal without written reasons. The
    central issue here was whether payments made by an employer during the period
    when a plaintiff could not work should be brought into account in assessing
    his damages for loss of earnings.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      provincial appellate courts were divided on whether such payments should
      be deducted from an overall damage award and the Supreme Court was called
      upon to resolve the conflict in the law.  The court decided the case on
      the basis of provable loss. There was no evidence that the plaintiff had
      given up a benefit in exchange for the wage payment received and had no
      obligation moral or otherwise to repay the benefit. His employer had advanced
      no subrogated claim.  The court concluded at paragraph 72:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The difficulty in this case is
      that neither a loss nor a contribution equivalent to payment of an insurance
      policy is established in this case.  The question thus is essentially this – must
      the plaintiff demonstrate a loss or contribution in order to recover, or
      is the court permitted to assume that because he was paid his earnings
      throughout his absence form work, he has in fact paid a quid pro quo and
      consequently suffered an equivalent loss?</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>In my view, it is inconsistent
      with the principles governing the recovery of damages in tort that the
      court should assume that because a benefit has been conferred by a third
      party, the plaintiff has suffered an equivalent loss. I know of no principle
      which could support such an assumption.  The rule remains as it has always
      been – a plaintiff is obliged to prove his or her loss.</span></p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>…
    the courts consistently favour the settlement of lawsuits in general. To
        put it another way, there is an overriding public interest in favour
        of settlement. This policy promotes the interest of litigants generally
        by saving them the expense of trial of disputed issues, and it reduces
        the strain upon an already overburdened provincial court system.</span></p>

      MCA is a type of agreement which partly settles a lawsuit. It permits participating
      or contracting claimants to settle their claims while maintaining their
      claims against remaining or non-contracting participants. A plaintiff who
      enters such an agreement with one of several defendants receives a certain
      recovery and maintains the chance to better that recovery in proceeding
      against the remaining defendants.  On the other side, the contracting (paying)
      defendant buys peace at a sum certain and in the usual MCA, although not
      in this case, the opportunity to recover some part of the money they paid

      existence of a MCA significantly alters the relationship among the parties
      to the litigation.  Usually the position of the parties will have changed
      from those set out in their pleadings. It is for this reason that the existence
      of such an agreement is to be disclosed, as soon as it is concluded, to
      the court and to the other parties to the litigation.  The reason for this
      is well stated in <i>Petty</i>, <i>supra</i>, at 737-738:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>32        The answer is obvious.
      The agreement must be disclosed to the parties and to the court as soon
      as the agreement is made.  The non-contracting defendants must be advised
      immediately because the agreement may well have an impact on the strategy
      and line of cross-examination to be pursued and evidence to be led by them.  The
      non-contracting parties must also be aware of the agreement so that they
      can properly assess the steps being taken from that point forward by the
      plaintiff and the contracting defendants. In short, procedural fairness
      requires immediate disclosure. Most importantly, the court must be informed
      immediately so that it can properly fulfil its role in controlling its
      process in the interests of fairness and justice to all parties.</span></p>

      of the early English cases considered the effect of a payment by one of
      two joint tortfeasors.  In <i>Bryanston Finance v. de Vries</i>, [1975]
      2 All E.R. 609 Lord Denning stated:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>In the present case, the question
      that arises is this: suppose that the plaintiff settles with one of the
      wrongdoers before judgment by accepting a sum in settlement; or suppose
      that by consent an order is made by which the plaintiff accepts an agreed
      sum from the one tortfeasor and discontinues against him, but goes on against
      the other.  I believe this to be a new point. It should be solved in the
      same way as the payment into court was solved.  If the plaintiff gets judgment
      against the remaining tortfeasor for a sum which is more than the sum already
      recovered (by the settlement or the consent order) he is entitled to enforce
      it for the excess over which he has already recovered.  But, if he gets
      judgment for less than he has already recovered, then he recovers nothing
      against the remaining tortfeasor and should pay the costs.  I do not think
      that it should depend on whether the sum was paid under a covenant not
      to sue or a release, such as was discussed in <i>Duck v. Mayeu</i> and <i>Cutler
      v. McPhail</i>. That is an arid and technical distinction without any merits.
      It is a trap into which the unwary fall but which the clever avoid. It
      should be discarded now that we have statutory provision for contribution
      between joint wrongdoers. The right solution nowadays is for any sum paid
      by the one wrongdoer under the settlement to be taken into account when
      assessing damages against the other wrongdoer.  If the plaintiff recovers
      more, he gets the extra. If he recovers less, he loses and has to pay the
      costs.  And as between the joint wrongdoers themselves, there can be contribution
      according to what is just and equitable...</span></p>

      court had occasion to consider the effect of a payment made prior to trial,
      to a plaintiff by one of two defendants.  In that case, the plaintiff suffered
      injuries when he fell on the deck of a ferry.  The plaintiff  had purchased
      a bus ticket from the defendant bus line.  His journey was to have been
      by bus and ferry. The defendant bus company contracted with the defendant

    route but slipped and fell in a pool of oil on the ferry deck and suffered
    injuries.  Each of the defendants argued the other was liable.  Before trial

      from the first defendant arise directly out of the very action in which
      all parties are involved. This is not a situation where the plaintiff has
      been injured and is receiving benefits from an independent insurance policy
      which he has maintained for himself, or has received any <i>ex gratia </i>payments
      from a third party such as an employer. But the payments here are directly
      related to the plaintiff’s claim against both defendants, i.e. for damages

      the Court of Appeal the issue was stated by Huddart J.A. as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>At its root, this appeal from
      an assessment of damages is about whether the settlement amounts received
      from a subsequent tortfeasor should be deducted from a damage award made
      against the original tortfeasor where a trial judge finds both tortfeasors
      caused the appellant an indivisible loss by their admitted negligence.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>She concluded:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>For the following reasons I find
      that the trial judge was correct to deduct the settlement amounts from
      the damage award against the respondents. The fundamental principle of
      damage awards is that the plaintiff should be “compensated for the full
      amount of his loss, but not more”. The proper focus of a damage award is
      on the plaintiff’s loss. The Court should not encourage settlement with
      the promise that plaintiffs may have the opportunity for double recovery.
      There is no valid policy reason for treating concurrent and consecutive
      torts differently when both are necessary causes of an indivisible injury
      and its consequential losses.</span></p>

      the case of <i>M.B. v. British Columbia</i>, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 477 a unanimous
      court held that the plaintiff’s social assistance benefits should be deducted
      from his damage award made against the Crown. Ultimately the court overturned
      the finding of liability against the Crown arising from the fact the plaintiff
      had been sexually abused while in foster care. Notwithstanding its dismissal
      of the action the court discussed the deductibility issue “… in the interest
      of providing guidance”.</span></p>

    , in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region

    and elsewhere on the deductibility of social benefits received by victims
    of tort.  At paragraph 41 of the reasons stated:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>In
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Lincoln</i><i> v. Hayman</i>, [1982] 2 All E.R. 819, the Court of Appeal
    held that a statutory income support payment received by the plaintiff was
    deductible from an award for past loss of earnings.  Lord Waller, at p. 823,
    gave a helpful statement of why deductibility was necessary to avoid double
    recovery.  The rationale that he put forward there seems also to apply to
    the case at bar:</span></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><span lang=EN-US>When he [the plaintiff] became
      unemployed he did not lose the total of his wages because part of that
      loss was replaced by supplementary benefit. If the supplementary benefit
      is not taken into account and deducted the plaintiff will recover more
      damages than he has suffered.  It will be a fortuitous windfall.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Similarly, in <i>Hodgson v. Trapp</i>,
      [1989] 1 A.C. 807, the House of Lords stated that statutory benefits in
      the form of mobility and attendance allowances were deductible from a tort
      damage award, on the grounds that
    “[t]o allow double recovery … at the expense of both taxpayers and insurers
    seems to me incapable of justification on any rational ground” (p. 823, <i>per </i>Lord
    Bridge).</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Clearly
      in this case the settlement monies received are on account of the same
      damage for which the plaintiff continued his proceeding against Sullivan,
      the non-contracting defendant. The plaintiff’s total damages have been
      assessed by a jury at $312,000 which is less than the amount he received
      from Roberts the contracting defendant.  To permit the plaintiff to recover
      any amount from Sullivan would result in double-recovery to the plaintiff.  I
      am satisfied that the law in this country is well-settled.  Double recovery,
      save in a few narrow exceptions which have no application to the facts
      here, is not permitted.</span></p>

    agreement in issue is technically not a true “Mary Carter” agreement.  This
    agreement has no provision whereby the contracting defendant is to recover
    some of the monies paid in the event the plaintiff recovers more than he/she
    was paid under the agreement.  Such a term is common to Mary Carter Agreements.  However,
    because the parties used that term to describe the agreement in issue, the
    same terminology is used in these reasons.</p>

      right not to disclose the amount of the settlement at that point, but he
      should have asked that consideration of the deduction issue be deferred,
