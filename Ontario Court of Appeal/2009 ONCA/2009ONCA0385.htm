    is an appeal from the order of McLean J. dated June 18, 2008, wherein he
    dismissed the appellants’ application for certain relief under the <i>Arthur
    Wishart Act (Franchise Disclosure), 2000</i>, S.O. 2000, c. 3 (“the Act”).  This

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>OVERVIEW</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
      June 24, 2007, the appellants entered into various agreements with the
      defendants for the purpose of obtaining a franchise agreement to operate
      a Dollar It store in the City of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ottawa.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>From
      the outset the business was not successful and on February 6, 2008, the
      appellants served the franchisor with a notice of rescission pursuant to
      s. 6(2) of the Act.  The appellants took the position that the respondents
      had not made the disclosure mandated by the Act. They brought an application
      for certain declaratory relief acknowledging their right to rescind the
      franchise and related agreements and for the refund of invested monies.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      application judge in brief reasons, concluded that the disclosure document
      given when considered “as a whole it is in compliance with the requirements
      under section 5 of the Act” and dismissed their application.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      my view, the application judge erred in concluding that the respondents
      had met the disclosure obligation required of them under the Act.  For
      the reasons that follow I would allow the appeal, set aside the order and
      direct that an order issue in accordance with these reasons.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellants entered into a franchise agreement and various ancillary and
      related agreements with the respondents on June 24, 2007.  Prior to entering
      these agreements, the respondents provided the appellants with a disclosure
      document in purported compliance with s. 5 of the Act.  The disclosure
      document was delivered May 31, 2007. In addition to the disclosure document,
      the respondents provided “generic” copies of the Dollar It Franchise Agreement,
      the Indemnity Agreement, the General Security Agreement, and the sublease.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There
      is little dispute that the disclosure document was missing required information
      and did not meet specific requirements of either s. 5 of the Act or the
      regulations.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      dispute between the parties centers on the interpretation to be given to
      s. 6 of the Act.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellants take the position that the disclosure provided was so deficient
      as to amount to no disclosure thus permitting them to avail themselves
      of the two-year window provided in s. 6(2) of the Act in which to rescind
      the franchise and related agreements.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      respondents, on the other hand, take the position that having provided
      a disclosure document, albeit one that was missing some required information,
      they have complied with s. 5 of the Act. Accordingly, if the appellants
      wished to rescind the franchise and related agreements the only opportunity
      to have done so was within the sixty-day window provided by s. 6(1) of
      the Act.  On this view, the purported rescission was out of time as it
      was served some eight months after the disclosure documents had been provided.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      application judge concluded in paragraph 3 of his reasons:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>…
    the only way the Applicants’ claim could succeed is if the Court found that
    the disclosure document was void <i>ab initio</i>.  For otherwise section
    6(1) would apply and the request for rescission would be barred under the
    Act 60 days after the delivery of the document.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>and further at paragraphs 5 and 6:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[5]       Here, however, there
      was one disclosure document given.  It seems that when we consider the
      matter as a whole it is in compliance with the requirements under section
      5 of the Act.  However, even if that were not the case, the court does
      not find that the want of compliance would in any way void this document <i>ab
      initio</i>.  It may well give a right to damages because of its incompleteness
      and any misrepresentations.  However, with regard to s. 6(2) it would have
      to be void <i>ab initio</i> for that limitation period to have effect.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[6]       Clearly, it was the
      legislature’s view that if the franchise transaction was completed without
      a disclosure document, then there is a 2-year limitation period within
      which rescission could be requested.  However, the argument to consider
      that this disclosure being void <i>ab initio</i> as requested is simply
      not consistent with the Act. The only reason it is argued by the Applicants
      that the disclosure should be considered a cause of avoidance is simply
      put as being its want of compliance with section 5 of the Act.  However,
      this very situation is contemplated in section 6(1) of the Act wherein
      there is a 60-day rescission period after the delivery of a non-compliant
      document.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      my view, if the application judge’s interpretation is permitted to stand,
      it would defeat the entire purpose of the Act which is to protect the interests
      of franchisees.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      analysis must begin with a consideration of the purpose of the legislation.  As
      this court noted in <i>Personal Service Coffee Corp. v.</i> <i>Beer </i>(2005),
      256 D.L.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 466 (Ont.
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) at para. 28:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>            It is clear, therefore,
      that the focus of the Act is on protecting the interests of franchisees.
      The mechanism for doing so is the imposition of rigorous disclosure requirements
      and strict penalties for non-compliance.  For that reason, any suggestion
      that these disclosure requirements or the penalties imposed for non-disclosure
      should be narrowly construed, must be met with skepticism.</span></p>

      respondents do not dispute that some of this information and documentation
      was not part of the disclosure document.  They concede some pieces were
      missing, but say that others were not required to be disclosed and yet
      others were substantially – if not entirely – disclosed.  Paragraph 4 of
      the respondents’ factum contains their response to the deficiencies complained
      of by the appellants and outlined above. Their explanations are as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>(a)       The respondents provided
      this certificate but did not sign it.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>(b)       Dollar It was still
      in its first year of business when it entered into the franchise agreements.  Therefore
      it was only obligated to provide its opening balance sheet. The disclosure
      document did not provide the opening balance sheet.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>(c)       The regulations do not
      require the disclosure of this lease and it was not a material fact.  In
      any event the terms of the so-called “Head Lease” are identical to those
      in the sublease executed by the appellants.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>(d)       The Appellants submit
      that Shikar Properties Inc. is a “franchisor’s associate” under the Act.  Even
      if that is true, the Regulations do not require disclosure of information
      about franchisor’s associate, but instead only require that the particular
      information disclosed be about the franchisor and any associates (for example,
      whether the franchisor and associates have applied for bankruptcy within
      the last six years).</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>(e)       The Disclosure document
      contained statements on the advertising fund.  The Disclosure document
      did not contain information about the percentage of the fund that would
      be spent nationally because Dollar It only operates in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario and therefore there is no national advertising.  The Disclosure document
    states that franchisees are required to contribute 1% of gross sales for
    advertising.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>(f)        The respondents concede
      that this information is missing from the Disclosure document and was instead
      contained in the Franchise Agreement. Instead, the Disclosure document
      stated that the exclusive territory would “generally” be a 1 km radius.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>(g)       Dollar It has no such
      policy.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>(h)       The respondents admit
      that this information was missing.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>(i)        Dollar It does not
      have any rebates for volume purchases, and the Disclosure document specifically
      states that “we generally do not provide material benefits … to franchisees
      based on use of designated or approved suppliers.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Disclosure
      under the Act is not optional.  A franchisor is mandated to provide a prospective
      franchisee with a disclosure document – one document – delivered as required
      by s. 5(2) – as one document at one time.  The content of the disclosure
      document is mandated by s. 5(4) of the Act and Part II of the regulations
      passed pursuant to the Act, O.Reg 581/00.  As this court noted in <i>1490664

    in the circumstances here, that the failure to include the mandated Certificate
    alone would be enough to conclude that there was not disclosure as required

    not with the Franchisor, Dollar It Limited but with Shikar Properties Inc.,
    described in the lease as the sub-landlord.  In the sub-lease, Dollar It
    Limited is described as “an affiliate of the Sub-Landlord”.  As one reads

    required by the Sub-Landlord, the Franchisor or the Landlord to give effect

    and the Offer/Head Lease.  The Sub-Tenant further acknowledges that it has

    sub-lease, ever comply with its acknowledgement obligation without receiving
    a copy of the Head Lease?  It is expected to accept all of the terms and
    obligations of the Head Lease and to be bound by them.  In my view to suggest,
    in these circumstances, that the Head Lease is not material and that there
    is no obligation to disclose it under the Act is absurd.  It is obviously

    the franchise agreement, the purchase and sale agreement and also signed
    the sublease on behalf of Shikar Properties Inc.  Clearly as sub-landlord,

      follows the list which include items 12 and 13 quoted above.  The Act requires

      this court noted in <i>Dig This Garden</i> at para. 18:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The requirement that disclosure
      occur in the form of a single document is not an empty formal requirement.
      The legislature clearly envisioned that the purpose of the legislation
      - i.e., ensuring that a decision to enter into a franchise agreement is
      an informed one - would best be fulfilled by giving prospective franchisees
      the opportunity to review a single document or documents so that all the
      information is before them at the same time.  It is simple common sense
      that people have more difficulty processing and assessing information given
      at different times, some of it orally, than they do information provided
      in a single, written document.</span></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

    “presented together in one part of the document”.  Again, I say, the purpose
    is obvious.  The important financial and other key information should be
    located together in one part of one document to enable a reader to clearly
    grasp what is required and to avoid the confusion and difficulty that may
    arise where reference must be had to numerous other documents where the information
    may be located.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
