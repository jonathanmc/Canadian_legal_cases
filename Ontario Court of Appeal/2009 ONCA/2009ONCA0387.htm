    is an appeal from the decision of the provincial offences appeal court judge,
    Pockele J., which granted an appeal from the decision of the trial judge,
    Justice of the Peace Woodworth.  The trial judge had stayed charges under
    the <i>Occupational Health and Safety Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. O.1 (OHSA)
    against the appellant, Lee Valley Tools Ltd. (
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Lee
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Valley).  The appeal court judge lifted the stay and remitted the charges
    to the trial judge who had concluded that, but for the stay, she would have
    registered convictions against Lee Valley.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    further appeal to this court challenges the appeal court judge’s conclusion
    that the trial judge erred in finding that the appellant established prejudice
    that compromised its right to a fair trial under s. 11(d) of the <i>Canadian
    Charter</i> <i>of Rights and Freedoms </i>and merited the stay of the charges.  The
    prejudice at issue was said to arise because a potential defence witness,
    Mr. Kochylema, was no longer available to give evidence by the time the charges
    were laid.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    regulatory charges arose from an accident in which a
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Lee
    <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">
    Valley employee injured his hand while using a table saw to make a kerf cut.  There
    was no operating guard in use on the saw to protect the employee’s hand.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    accident occurred on September 5, 2003.  An inspector from the Ministry of
    Labour filed his report recommending prosecution by December 18, 2003.  Eight
    months later, on August 11, 2004, still within the one-year OHSA limitation
    period, the Ministry laid three charges alleging that Lee Valley failed to
    equip its saw with a guard, failed to provide instruction and supervision,
    and failed to provide a safe procedure for kerf cuts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  On
    the day of the accident, and for approximately two weeks before, Mr. Kochylema,
    the injured employee’s primary supervisor, was not on the premises.  He was
    on holiday.  On the day of the accident, the employee’s immediate supervisor
    was a Mr. Johnston, who had himself been trained by Mr. Kochylema.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Subsequent
    to the accident, Lee Valley was ordered to submit a “detailed investigation
    report” to the Ministry inspector.  As part of his own investigation, the
    Ministry inspector obtained a written statement from Mr. Kochylema.  That
    statement was not helpful to Lee Valley.  By the time the charges were laid,
    Mr. Kochylema had terminal cancer.  He died on September 22, 2004.  The parties
    agreed and the trial judge accepted that Lee Valley did not have an opportunity
    to speak with Mr. Kochylema about its defence given the timing of the charges.  </p>
  <h4><i><span
lang=EN-US>The Trial</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    the outset of the trial,
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">
    Lee
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Valley argued that the delay between the accident and the trial, when combined
    with Mr. Kochylema’s lost evidence, breached its s. 11(d) <i>Charter</i> right
    to a fair trial or constituted an abuse of process, either of which should
    be remedied by a stay of the charges.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    injured worker and Mr. Johnston testified for the prosecution at trial.  Their
    evidence about the instructions they had been given was not helpful to the
    defence.  However, the store manager gave testimony that Mr. Kochylema “would
    have been able to provide a more detailed account of the specific steps taken
    in the wood shop to ensure the health and safety of the workers”.  The trial
    judge was particularly concerned about evidence Lee Valley may have been
    able to obtain regarding communications Mr. Kochylema may have had with the
    injured employee or with Mr. Johnston about the use of the guard and experience
    with the tools.  While the trial judge was cognizant of Mr. Kochylema’s earlier
    statement to the inspector and his pre-charge availability to give a statement
    to Lee Valley, she concluded that there was “no reason for such a statement
    to have any focus on the issue of due diligence.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge concluded that Mr. Kochylema could have testified to more safety
    initiatives.  She found, since Mr. Kochylema’s evidence was not available,
    that it was
    “virtually impossible” for Lee Valley to effectively cross-examine the injured
    worker or Mr. Johnston.  However, the trial judge did not explain what aspects
    of Mr. Kochylema’s potential evidence could have assisted the cross-examination
    of Lee Valley’s other employees or advanced its defence that it took all
    reasonable steps to avoid the accident.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">
    Lee
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Valley argued both a s. 11(d) breach and abuse of process, the trial judge
    disposed of the latter argument on the basis that there was no evidence “of
    any oblique purpose or <i>mala fides</i> on the part of the Crown”.  However,
    she concluded that
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Lee
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Valley’s s. 11(d) right to a fair trial was “irremediably prejudiced”.  Finding
    that this was one of “the clearest of cases”, the trial judge granted the
    remedy of a stay of proceedings under s. 24(1) of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US>The Appeal</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appeal court judge acknowledged the appropriate standard of review, including
    the “great deference” to be accorded to a trial judge’s findings of fact,
    which should not be set aside absent palpable and overriding error.  He recognized
    the reason for this high level of deference and cautioned himself against “second
    guessing” the findings and inferences drawn by the trial judge.  Nonetheless,
    the appeal court judge concluded that “there was insufficient evidence before
    the court to support her finding that the evidence of the deceased would
    have, and I underline, <u>assisted in fact and in a material way the conduct
    of the defence</u>”
    and thereby prejudiced Lee Valley.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appeal court judge described the trial judge’s findings of fact as “speculative”.  Relying
    on <i>R. v. Gatley</i> (1992), 74 C.C.C. (3d) 468 (B.C.C.A.), <span style='line-height:200%'>where
    the accused conceded that <span style='color:black'>he had the onus to demonstrate
    actual prejudice from the pre-charge delay,</span> </span>and <i>R. v A.(D.)</i> (1992),
    10 O.R. (3d) 241, affirmed [1993] 2 S.C.R. 441, which I will discuss later
    in these reasons, the appeal court judge concluded that the accused failed
    to meet the onus of demonstrating actual prejudice.  He noted that the trial
    judge did not refer “to a single fact that would have been elicited from
    the deceased witness.”  Indeed, the appeal court judge noted:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[N]o evidence was put before the court as to what
    the deceased would say about the training procedures, maintenance of the
    equipment, guards or anything whatsoever other than the fact that [Mr. Kochylema]
    might have been the major repository of such knowledge.  There was no evidence
    as to what the deceased might have said in testimony to assist
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">
    Lee
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Valley in defence of these charges.  There is a vast gap between “actual,
    known, material evidence” and “unknown testimony which might be material.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal court judge accordingly allowed the appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ISSUES</span></h4>

lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US>Standard of Review</span></i></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant argues that the appeal court judge erred in overturning what was
    essentially a discretionary decision to stay the charges and in concluding
    that the trial judge made palpable and overriding errors of fact.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%;color:black;'>A
      discretionary decision will be overturned only in limited circumstances.  As
      Weiler J.A. explained in <i>R. v. Bradford</i> (2001), 52 O.R. (3d) 257,
      at para. 3,</span> “[a]<span style='line-height:200%;color:black;'>n appellate
      court will only be justified in interfering with a trial judge’s discretionary
      decision if “‘... the trial judge misdirects himself or if his decision
      is so clearly wrong as to amount to an injustice’ [citations omitted]”.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    this was not a case where the appeal court judge overturned an exercise of
    discretion on the part of the trial judge.  Rather, the appeal, at least
    regarding the issue of prejudice, turned on the trial judge’s findings of
    fact, the inferences she drew from those facts and her application of the
    law.  The appeal court judge recognized that it was not open to him to overturn
    factual findings and inferences absent palpable and overriding error.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly,
    I see no error in the standard of review applied by the appeal court judge.  I
    would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US>The Requisite Prejudice</span></i></h4>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Putting
    aside that the charges were laid within the one-year limitation, in my view,
    the appeal can be dismissed on the following basis.<b> </b> The appeal court
    judge made no error in concluding that Lee Valley failed to establish that
    the allegedly lost evidence would have assisted its defence in a material
    way (causing an unfair trial), or that the absence of the evidence irreparably
    prejudiced the appellant (justifying a stay of the charges). </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='line-height:200%;
color:black;'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>R.
      v. A.(D.)</i>, Dubin C.J.O. considered an accused’s ss. 7 and 11(d) <i>Charter</i> challenges,
      which were based on lost potential witnesses.  In observing that witnesses
      can disappear even with a brief delay, sometimes to the advantage and sometimes
      to the disadvantage of an accused, Dubin C.J.O. concluded in the case before
      him “the nature of the evidence which the deceased may have provided is
      purely speculative.”  He continued: “[t]here is no basis to conclude that
      that evidence would be material in the sense that it would likely have
      assisted the defence in rebutting the Crown’s case.  Indeed, it could well
      have supported the Crown’s case against the respondent.”  He concluded
      that the trial judge erred in holding that “all that was necessary was
      that the deceased could have testified on some relevant issues, without
      more.” </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span

color:black;'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dubin
    C.J.O. instructed that there must be more than potential relevance to the
    evidence and “[t]here must be an air of reality that the missing evidence
    would in fact and in a material way assist the accused.”  On this issue,
    he quoted with approval from a ruling of <span style='line-height:
200%;color:black;'>Campbell J. in <i>R. v. Finta</i>, an unreported judgment
    of the Supreme Court of Ontario, delivered April 24, 1990.  In that ruling,
    Campbell J. explained the parameters of the burden on the accused to show
    that the lost evidence precluded a fair trial:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The defence does, however, have a burden to show
    that the lost evidence is likely to preclude a fair trial. It is a first
    step in discharging that burden to show what the evidence is, to show that
    there is more than a basis in speculation to say what, in fact, what the
    lost evidence is or that the lost witness would, in fact say.  A burden to
    show that the lost evidence is relevant and material.  A burden to show that
    it is substantial or significant in the sense it is not trivial or frivolous
    or tenuous.  <i>It is a first step of this motion to show that the lost evidence
    would more likely than not tend to rebut some evidence of the Crown’s case
    or would more likely than not tend to assist the accused.</i> </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If the evidence points to the innocence of the
    accused that would, of course, satisfy this pre-condition but it is not necessary
    the evidence go that far and actually point to the innocence of the accused
    as opposed to merely assisting the accused or tending to rebut some evidence
    or some element of the Crown’s case.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is, however, with those cautions, necessary
    to make some assessment of the potential value to the accused of the lost
    evidence.  <i>If there is no demonstration that the evidence would help him
    or if it appears that the evidence might just as easily hurt the accused
    more than it would help him, that tends to rebut any claim that its loss
    would preclude a fair trial to the accused.</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There must be an air of substantial reality about
    the claim that any particular piece of lost evidence or all of it cumulatively
    together would actually assist the accused in his defence.  If there is no
    such air of substantial reality, it cannot be said the delay which caused
    the loss of evidence is likely to preclude a fair trial for the accused.  [Emphasis

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Bradford</i><b>,</b> this court considered an argument alleging a s. 7 <i>Charter</i> breach
    based on the loss of one of the complainant’s statements to the police in
    a sexual assault case.  Weiler J.A., writing for the court, explained that,
    in assessing the prejudice of the loss to the accused’s right to make full
    answer and defence, the trial judge had failed to consider the lost statement
    in context and to determine whether there was an adequate substitute for
    the statement.  Referring to <i>R. v. Mills</i>, [1999] 3 S.C.R. 668, at
    paras. 73-76 and <i>La</i>, at para. 25,<b> </b>she explained at para. 7
    that an accused cannot establish an “automatic”
    breach of his right to make full answer and defence by simply showing that
    he was “deprived of relevant information”.  The accused must establish actual
    prejudice to his right to a fair trial.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    considering whether a trial would be unfair, Weiler J.A. explained that “it
    is important to bear in mind that the accused is entitled to a trial that
    is fundamentally fair and not the fairest of all possible trials.”  See also <i>R.
    v. O’Connor</i>, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 411, at para. 193. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    follows, Weiler J.A. explained at para. 8 that “[a]ctual prejudice occurs
    when the accused is unable to put forward his or her defence due to the lost
    evidence and not simply that the loss of the evidence makes putting forward
    the position more difficult.”  In the case before her, she determined at
    para. 46 that while the task of the defence was made more difficult by the
    missing statement, it did not render the accused’s trial fundamentally unfair.<span style='line-height:200%;color:black;'>  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    addition, Weiler J.A. observed the constraints on the remedy of a stay.  A
    stay is only granted in the “clearest of cases” where the accused’s right
    to a fair trial is irreparably prejudiced or the integrity of the administration
    of justice is irreparably harmed: see also <i>R. v. Knox </i>(2006), 80 O.R.
    (3d) 515, at para. 32.  Only irreparable prejudice is at issue in this case.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly,
    the appellant had the onus to show actual prejudice by demonstrating that
    the missing witness would have given specific evidence without which the
    appellant would have been unable to fairly put forward its defence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span

    this case, the trial judge concluded that the lost Kochylema evidence prejudiced
    Lee Valley’s right to a fair trial because, unlike Mr. Kochylema’s post-accident
    statement to the inspector, his trial evidence could have focused on due
    diligence, particularly regarding safety issues.  Lee Valley argues that
    this is enough to establish the required air of reality and that it need
    not prove the precise content of the lost evidence.  However, Mr. Kochylema
    was absent around the time of the accident, which would suggest he had no
    direct knowledge of the circumstances of the accident.  Moreover, the appellant
    does not explain what evidence Mr. Kochylema could have given about earlier
    safety precautions or steps, other than the evidence that he was responsible
    for safety issues.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    fact that a witness may have relevant evidence is not enough to establish
    prejudice.  There is no basis to conclude that the missing evidence in this
    case would have assisted the defence; it could well have supported the Crown’s
    case, as did the evidence of the injured worker and his immediate supervisor.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    these circumstances, the appeal court judge was entitled to conclude that
    the trial judge’s finding that the appellant suffered prejudice was premised
    on “unsubstantiated speculation”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly,
    in my view, it was open to the appeal court judge to conclude that
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Lee
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Valley did not establish that the missing evidence would have assisted the
    appellant or that its absence impaired its right to a fair trial.  Moreover,
    even if the missing evidence made the defence more difficult, this did not
    render the trial fundamentally unfair. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the alternative, the appellant argues that it did not need to prove actual
    prejudice and that the requisite degree of prejudice can be “inferred” or “presumed” from
    Mr. Kochylema’s knowledge of safety precautions taken by Lee Valley.  However,
    this is not the type of case where prejudice can be inferred from trial delay,
    nor where prejudice can be inferred on the basis of the fading memories of
    material witnesses.  Instead, this is a case of alleged trial unfairness
    because a potential witness is no longer available to testify in circumstances
    where there is a dearth of particulars about what testimony he would have
    provided.  Either the missing witness had evidence that would have been helpful
    to the appellant or he did not.  In such a case, prejudice can be assessed
    by considering the evidence that the witness would have given had he been
    available.  Actual prejudice cannot be presumed or inferred from the mere
    fact of lost evidence without more.</p>

    the light of this conclusion, it is unnecessary to deal with the appellant’s
    remaining ground of appeal regarding the pre-charge delay and the exceptional
    nature of the facts in this case.  However, I do not read the appeal court
    judge’s reasons on the question of establishing prejudice as depending upon
    the absence of fault or ulterior motive on the part of the Crown. </p>
