  <p class=HeadingNumber style='page-break-after:
avoid'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    December 16, 1997, the home of the respondent, Bridgette Sagl, was destroyed
    by fire.  In this action she claimed against her insurer, the appellant,
    Chubb Insurance Company of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    , among others, for the losses she sustained in the conflagration. Chubb
    defended the claim by denying coverage on the basis that the fire was the
    result of arson in which Sagl participated and that she had intentionally
    made material misrepresentations to Chubb, both in her initial application
    for coverage and in presenting her claim under the policy.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    a twenty-two day trial, the trial judge gave lengthy reasons in which he
    rejected all three defences.  The trial judge was not satisfied that Chubb
    had demonstrated that the fire was incendiary in origin or, if so, that Sagl
    had any involvement in it.  He further held that Chubb failed to prove that
    Sagl made any intentional material misrepresentations in her dealings with
    Chubb. The trial judge therefore awarded Sagl damages in the amount of $4,534,354.47
    plus $500,000 in punitive damages, as well as substantial indemnity costs.  Chubb
    was also ordered to pay the costs of the defendant, Cosburn, Griffiths &amp;
    Brandham Insurance Brokers Limited (Cosburn) on a partial indemnity basis.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this appeal Chubb challenges the trial judge’s failure to find that it had
    established intentional material misrepresentation in the application for
    coverage and in the proof of loss, his application of s. 124 of the <i>Insurance
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8, to the binder of insurance in place at the
    time of the fire, the award of punitive damages, and the costs awards.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    would allow the appeal and order a new trial by reason of errors made in
    the trial judge’s analysis of Sagl’s proof of loss.  I would limit the new
    trial to the issue of Sagl’s loss, specifically whether she is able to prove
    her loss in relation to her fine arts collection, and whether the policy
    is void due to intentional misrepresentation in the proof of loss. The new
    trial would include, if appropriate, a consideration of the application of
    s. 129 of the <i>Insurance Act.</i></p>
  <h2>II.        FACTS</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    1979, Sagl began living with Rudy Sagl.  They married in 1984.  Rudy Sagl
    was a successful businessman and the Sagls enjoyed a lavish lifestyle.  Sagl
    collected art, furniture, jewelry, and glassware throughout her lifetime.
    Every inch of wall space in her home was adorned with art, and many more
    pieces were stored throughout the house. </p>
  <h2>(1)       Sagl’s financial circumstances in the fall of 1997</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the early 1990s, the marriage ended and lengthy acrimonious litigation ensued.  By
    judgment dated
    <st1:date Year="1997" Day="11" Month="7" w:st="on">
    July 11, 1997, E. Macdonald J. ordered Rudy Sagl to pay his wife a lump sum
    of $4 million, payable on a quarterly basis, plus significant on-going support.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    the time when Sagl applied for insurance coverage with Chubb, she owned two
    adjoining homes on
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Doulton Drive in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Mississauga,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario.  She and her teenage son lived in
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    2415 Doulton Drive and her daughter lived next door at
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    2399 Doulton Drive.  Following the release of E. Macdonald J.’s judgment
    in July 1997, Sagl engaged an insurance sub-broker, Eamonn Kinsella of G.C.
    Carley &amp; Co. Limited, to obtain insurance for the two houses and contents,
    including her artwork and jewelry.             </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Kinsella
    presented Sagl to Chubb as a wealthy individual.  He told Chubb’s agent that
    Sagl would soon be receiving a substantial divorce settlement. Furthermore,
    Kinsella testified that he had visited Sagl on a number of occasions and
    knew that her home contained lavish and over-powering furnishings as well
    as an extraordinary number of pieces of art.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    the evidence relevant to Sagl’s financial situation disclosed that when Sagl
    applied for insurance with Chubb, she was experiencing certain financial
    difficulties.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>She
    was in default on three mortgages with respect to the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    two Doulton Drive properties.  Although a prospective purchaser had submitted
    conditional offers for the purchase of both properties, the conditions subsequently
    expired on November 20, 1997.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    addition, Sagl owed substantial amounts to the Canada Revenue Agency, law
    firms and friends. In the fall of 1997, when she applied to Chubb for insurance
    coverage, Sagl’s debts, excluding the mortgages, totalled over $1 million.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Further,
    at the time Sagl applied for insurance from Chubb, there was some ambiguity
    as to whether Rudy Sagl remained registered on title as a joint owner of
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    2415 Doulton Drive.  In addition, due to Rudy Sagl’s tax arrears of over
    $1 million, the Canada Revenue Agency had filed an execution against 2415,
    which precluded Sagl from dealing with the property. Sagl knew of this additional
    problem as evidenced by her letter dated August 6, 1997, in which she asked
    the Canada Revenue Agency to lift the execution stating that she
    “must secure refinancing very quickly to avoid being evicted and facing legal
    proceedings against the house”.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Kinsella
    was not aware of this information, did not ask Sagl questions relating to
    these issues, and hence did not provide any of this information to Chubb’s
    agent. </p>
  <h2>(2)       The parties’ interaction between the time when Chubb provided
    coverage and the fire  </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    September 30, 1997, by the execution of a binder of insurance, Chubb, through
    Cosburn, placed homeowner’s insurance on both properties and their contents
    through what Chubb referred to as its VIP program.  The binder provided coverage
    on
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    2415 Doulton Drive for the dwelling ($630,000), contents ($600,000), fine
    arts ($2,000,000) and scheduled jewelry items ($1,000,000).  The estimated
    annual premium was initially over $20,000.  The binder indicated that it
    was prepared for convenience only and was subject to the terms and conditions
    of Chubb’s then standard policy.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Chubb
    pursued neither the completion of a detailed application for insurance nor
    an inspection of the properties, the contents, the jewelry or the fine art
    collections during the eleven weeks between the date the binder was issued
    and the fire. Nonetheless, there was extensive communication between the
    parties.  Kinsella, who was the only person who had direct contact with Sagl,
    communicated with John Fountain and Bob Connell of Cosburn. This contact
    primarily centred on Sagl’s efforts to reduce her premiums and Kinsella’s
    suggestion that she store some items of jewelry in a bank vault.  Kinsella
    testified that he and Sagl reached an agreement on which items of jewelry
    would be kept at the bank, but Sagl gave evidence that she never agreed to
    any such allocation. The contact also included Connell’s requesting that
    Sagl sign an application form, and Kinsella’s informing Sagl that Chubb intended
    to impose a $2,500 sublimit on each piece of art unless Chubb received an
    appraisal.</p>
  <h2>(3)       The fire</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

    the night of the fire, no one was home. Sagl was out for dinner with a friend.  Her
    son was staying overnight with a schoolmate. The live-in maid had spent the
    night away.  The dog had been left outside. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>  An
    investigator from the Office of the Fire Marshall conducted an investigation
    of the scene and concluded that the fire was incendiary in origin.  His conclusion
    was supported by his supervisor.  Constable Andrew Pennington of the Peel
    Regional Police notified the Criminal Investigation Bureau of the possibility
    of arson, given his “suspicions due to the nature of the information” he
    received.  An investigation concerning the circumstances surrounding the
    fire ensued.</p>

    wrote a letter to Sagl dated June 8, 1998, in which it expressed its concern
    that Sagl had failed to disclose “important facts” to Chubb including that
    Rudy Sagl was registered as a joint owner of 2415, that there was a first
    mortgage registered on the property which was in default, that the mortgagee
    was pursuing an action against Sagl for judgment on the mortgage debt and
    for possession of 2415, that there was a mortgage on 2399 which was also
    in default, and that the mortgagee had obtained a judgment for possession,
    subject to a temporary stay.  In the letter, Chubb stated that it was “not
    in a position at this time to make a responsible determination as to whether
    the policy is void for misrepresentation and/or non-disclosure”, but proposed
    to review the matters with Sagl in the course of her on-going examination
    under oath.  Chubb also gave notice in the letter that it was cancelling
    the policy. </p>

  <h2>III.       REASONS OF THE TRIAL JUDGE</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge started his analysis with a brief review of the family history,
    noting the lavish lifestyle and Sagl’s passion for collecting, particularly
    paintings.   </p>
  <h2>(1)       The arson defence</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>He
    then proceeded to deal with Chubb’s arson defence, a defence he rejected
    on the basis that he did not accept Chubb’s submissions that Sagl had opportunity
    and motive to have someone set fire to her home. He also preferred Sagl’s
    expert evidence as to the cause of the fire to that upon which Chubb relied.  Further,
    after reviewing Sagl’s explanation for Chubb’s various concerns, he found
    nothing sinister in the circumstances surrounding the fire.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Chubb
    retained Robert De Berardis of De Berardis Associates Incorporated to conduct
    a forensic investigation into the cause of the fire.  In his report, he concluded
    that the fire was incendiary in nature; his investigation showed multiple
    areas of fire origin, distinct and separate from each other. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Sagl’s
    expert, Dennis Merkley, did not share this view.  He expressed concern about
    the lack of scientific evidence of any use of an accelerant.  On the basis
    of the available evidence, Merkley concluded that the fire had a single source
    that started in the basement and spread to the rest of the house.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    between the expert opinions of Merkley and De Berardis, the trial judge preferred
    Merkley’s conclusions based on his more extensive experience and the fact
    that, according to the trial judge at para. 78, his evidence was “logical
    and [made] common sense.”  The trial judge ultimately, at para. 94, accepted
    Merkley’s opinion that the cause of the fire was “undetermined”.  At para.
    107, he went further and found that even if the fire was deliberately set,
    the “weight of the evidence” did not point to Sagl’s being involved. </p>
  <h2>(2)       The coverage</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge next dealt with the nature of the insurance coverage at the time
    of the fire.  After identifying the specific coverage provided in the binder,
    he turned to the discussions between Kinsella and Sagl after the binder had
    been issued.  He held that to the extent anything was agreed upon, nothing
    was reduced to writing and signed by Sagl.  Accordingly, the trial judge,
    relying on s. 124 of the <i>Insurance Act,</i> concluded that none of the
    discussions subsequent to the execution of the binder affected the extent
    of the coverage Chubb was obligated to provide under the terms of the binder.</p>
  <h2>(3)       Intentional misrepresentation prior to the fire</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge began this part of his analysis by noting, at para. 136, that
    the binder was subject to the following provision contained in the policy
    of insurance:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote style='
page-break-after:avoid'><b>Concealment or fraud</b></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote style='
page-break-after:avoid'>This policy is void if you or any covered person has
    intentionally concealed or misrepresented any material fact relating to this
    policy before or after a loss. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>He
    then turned to the issue, at paras. 137-141, of whether Sagl intentionally
    concealed or misrepresented any material fact prior to the loss, beginning
    with an expression of concern regarding Chubb’s business practices:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>137.    Since the insurance policy was not issued
    prior to the fire, the plaintiff had no knowledge of the above express condition.
    Prior to the issuance of the Binder of Insurance, the plaintiff was not advised
    of this express condition. How could the plaintiff intentionally conceal
    or misrepresent something of which she had no knowledge?  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>138.    Only an insurer knows what it considers
    a &quot;material fact&quot; in relation to a risk it is assuming. How does
    an insured know what a &quot;material fact&quot;
    is unless so advised by the insurer? I am incensed that an insurer can hide
    behind this express condition without advising an insured of what the insurer
    considers to be a &quot;material fact&quot;.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>139.    In <i>Chenier et al. v. Madill</i> (1974),
    2 O.R. (2d) 361 (Ont. H.C.), Galligan J. held,
    &quot;... in the absence of knowledge of the materiality to the insurer of
    the circumstances, there can be no fraud in the omission to communicate them.&quot;   </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>140.    At the time the plaintiff sought this insurance
    coverage from Chubb, Chubb did not require an insured to complete an application
    form. However, Cosburn sent the plaintiff an application form which was not
    a Chubb form. The plaintiff signed the incomplete form and returned it to
    Cosburn. I note that neither Chubb nor Cosburn ever followed up with the
    plaintiff to have her fully complete the application that she signed.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>141.    I cannot believe that the business of insurance
    was conducted in such a nonchalant fashion.  Presumably, Chubb has improved
    its underwriting practices over the past ten years.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge, at para. 142, proceeded to examine the three main material fact
    allegations upon which Chubb relied in support of its material misrepresentation
    defence and which, Chubb alleged, “if known by Chubb, would have caused such
    concern to Chubb that it would have declined coverages.”   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    first was that Rudy Sagl was a joint owner of the property.  In this respect,
    the trial judge noted the direction Rudy Sagl had signed in which he purported
    to release his interest in the property.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge next addressed the proceedings commenced by MRS Trust in relation
    to its mortgage on the property.  He observed that Sagl had consented to
    judgment on the basis that the property was for sale and further that she
    was expecting to receive money from Rudy Sagl pursuant to the judgment of
    E. Macdonald J.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    the trial judge dealt with Chubb’s claim that Sagl misrepresented herself
    as a wealthy individual when, in fact, she was in dire financial straights.  He
    commented on the fact that the Chubb VIP program was available to anyone
    who owned real estate valued at more than $400,000 even if there were a $200,000
    mortgage on the property.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge’s problem with Chubb’s position with respect to this aspect of
    its defence rested on Chubb’s inability to demonstrate that these issues
    were material to its consideration and ultimate assumption of the risk.  In
    concluding that prior to the fire Sagl did not intentionally conceal or misrepresent
    any facts material to the risk, he set out his view of Chubb’s obligation
    to communicate issues of materiality with an insured or potential insured
    at paras. 147-152:  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>147.    If, as in this case, it was a material fact
    as to the names of the titled owners of the property, that information could
    have been elicited on a proper application form.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>148.    If, as in this case, it was a material fact
    as to whether the property was mortgaged and the status of any mortgages,
    that information could have been gained from a proper application form. </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>149.    Similarly, if it is a material fact to an
    insurer to know the financial viability of a potential insured, that information
    could be obtained easily by the appropriate questions on an application form. </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>150.    A proper application form should contain
    a warning with reference to the above express condition. The application
    should be signed by a potential insured in the presence of a broker witness
    who has reviewed the application form information with the applicant who
    has been advised of the material facts of the insurer and told about the
    consequences of concealing or misrepresenting any material fact.  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>151.    I agree that an insurer expects an applicant
    for insurance to act in the utmost good faith in seeking insurance coverage.
    But, fairness requires that an insurer also act in the utmost good faith.
    It is my view that an insurer cannot rely on the above express condition
    unless the applicant for insurance is advised of what the insurer considers
    to be material facts, and the consequences of concealment and misrepresentation.
    Chubb failed to act in the utmost good faith toward the plaintiff at the
    time she requested insurance coverage.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>152.    I find that the plaintiff did not intentionally
    conceal or misrepresent any material facts in relation to the insurance coverage
    requested prior to the fire.</p>
  <h2>(4)       Intentional misrepresentation in the proof of loss</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge next dealt with Chubb’s defence that after the fire Sagl intentionally
    concealed or misrepresented material facts in her proof of loss.  Chubb took
    the position that Sagl’s proof of loss for contents and fine art was replete
    with fraudulent claims and false statements. The trial judge analyzed this
    issue by asking himself whether the proof of loss was fraudulent or whether
    the evidence disclosed merely a difference of opinion as to value, particularly
    in relation to the contents and fine art claim.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    first contentious issue the trial judge analyzed was the claim for loss or
    damage to the contents of Sagl’s home.  He accepted the evidence upon which
    Sagl relied, largely an inventory prepared by Kevin Watson of National Fire
    Adjusters that was based on Sagl’s recollection of 563 items in her home.  From
    this inventory, Watson valued the contents at over $2,000,000.  The trial
    judge accepted this valuation, concluding that the value of the contents
    of 2415 exceeded the binder coverage of $600,000. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Turning
    to the claim for loss of jewelry, the trial judge noted that Sagl’s claim
    was for $923,450 plus PST and GST, an amount that exceeded the binder coverage
    of $1,000,000.  The trial judge expressed reservations about the amount of
    the jewelry claim but in the absence of an adequate response from Chubb to
    Sagl’s jewelry claim, he found that Sagl had established a loss of $1,000,000.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge examined Sagl’s fine art claim in considerable detail, acknowledging
    the evidence of the large extent of Sagl’s collection.  He noted Sagl had
    made earlier attempts to value the fine art collection.  In 1995, Sagl had
    wanted to borrow money against her large collection of framed and unframed
    pieces of art and an art expert, Stephen Sweeting, whom Chubb later retained
    as its expert in this action, had viewed some of the collection for valuation
    purposes, but not the art work on the second floor.  The trial judge observed
    that Sweeting had arrived at a value of $750,000 to $1,000,000, although
    the extent to which Sweeting inspected the fine art collection was unclear,
    as was the question whether Sweeting’s estimate applied only to the sixty
    items selected by Sagl for appraisal at that time.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>He
    also noted, at para. 189, that in the matrimonial trial, E. Macdonald J. “wrestled
    with the value of the Sagls’
    artwork”, and set out a number of paragraphs from her July 1997 judgment,
    concluding with the following:</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;'>30.       I have no reliable
    information on this issue.  The wife’s net family property statement suggests
    a valuation date value of $5,000,000.  The husband suggests $750,000.  I
    have decided to place a value for purposes of calculating the net family
    property at $1,000,000 and to attribute $500,000 to each of them.  This may
    appear to be ‘rough justice’ but I have <i>no</i> reliable information on
    this issue.  The documents provided to me are unreliable and contrived. [Emphasis
    in original.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge next reviewed the evidence of Sagl’s expert, Darragh Elliott,
    who prepared an extensive report on Sagl’s behalf in which he assessed the
    total value of Sagl’s fine art destroyed in the fire.  Sagl, with the benefit
    of Sweeting’s appraisal and an incomplete set of photographs, identified
    to Elliott each of the 2,580 items in her collection.   From this inventory,
    Elliott valued the loss of Sagl’s fine art collection at $9,720,980.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge then considered and rejected Chubb’s submissions in support of
    its allegations that the Elliott report overstated Sagl’s loss in relation
    to the fine art collection.  As the “clearest” example, Chubb argued that
    both the existence and the US$600,000 value attached to a Rodin bronze figure,
    L’Eternel Printemps, were particularly implausible.   Chubb noted that, according
    to Sagl, the sculpture was kept in the back of the basement storage room,
    and there was no photograph of it.  Chubb argued there was no evidence Sagl
    had ever mentioned it or showed it to anyone, including Sweeting when he
    did his appraisal in 1995, and that it was not disclosed in the matrimonial
    law suit.  The only evidence of its existence was in the World of Antiques
    list of items Sagl allegedly purchased from that store.   On the list it
    is described as a “limited edition (36) bronze casting” for which Sagl had
    paid $6,500.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    para. 204, the trial judge stated: “I am not sure what a ‘material fact’ would
    be in relation to the fine art claim.”  He went on to characterize Chubb’s
    main argument as being one of inflated values.  He expressed scepticism of
    Elliott’s evaluation, but said that his “problem” was that Chubb did not
    have its expert, Sweeting, review and rebut Elliott’s report and held, at
    para. 206, that he therefore had “no basis upon which to find that Elliott’s
    methodology is either flawed or fraudulent. In the same paragraph, he went
    on to say, “Elliott’s report may be flawed but that does not make his estimate
    of the value of the fine art fraudulent.”  After faulting Chubb for poor
    business practices in not insisting on appraisals, particularly in view of
    the extent of the coverage, the trial judge found that Chubb had failed to
    prove that Sagl intentionally concealed or misrepresented a material fact
    in relation to the art collection and again, made note of the fact that Sagl
    was underinsured:  this aspect of her loss exceeded the insurance coverage
    of $2 million.  </p>
  <h2>(5)       Punitive damages</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge then turned to Sagl’s claim for punitive damages.  He observed
    that while the jewelry coverage and fine art coverage provided for in the
    binder were “exceptional”, Chubb had failed to inspect the residence to determine
    whether the amount of coverage was appropriate.  Furthermore, Chubb had failed
    to prove that Sagl was implicated in the alleged arson or that she had misrepresented
    or concealed any material facts relevant to the risk it was assuming.  He
    explained his conclusion that Sagl was entitled to punitive damages in the
    amount of $500,000 at paras. 231-237:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>231.    In my view, Chubb had tunnel vision and
    failed to consider the evidence in an impartial and common sense way. There
    was no direct evidence implicating the plaintiff in any way with the fire.
    Chubb knew the high standard of proof required to support its allegations
    of criminal activity by the plaintiff, and without any proof Chubb persisted
    in persecuting the plaintiff with false allegations.  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>232.    It is a serious matter to allege that a
    plaintiff has committed a criminal offence without putting forth any direct
    evidence to prove the allegation. That is a breach of the duty [of] good
    faith and is reprehensible conduct.  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>233.    Chubb continued its reprehensible conduct
    when it alleged that the plaintiff
    &quot;misrepresented and/or concealed&quot; material facts relevant to the
    risk that Chubb was assuming. I have already found that because of Chubb's
    poor underwriting procedures it breached its duty of good faith to the plaintiff.
    Chubb failed to have the plaintiff complete a proper application form which
    should have set out in question form the information which Chubb considered
    to be &quot;material facts&quot; upon which it would determine whether to
    grant coverage.  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>234.    It is a breach of the duty of good faith
    by an insurer to allege misrepresentation and concealment against an insured,
    when an insured has no opportunity to know or provide the facts which an
    insurer considers &quot;material&quot; to the risk it is assuming. </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>235.    Chubb even went further in its breach of
    duty of good faith in alleging that the plaintiff has committed fraud in
    her proof of loss for contents and fine art. I have already found that the
    plaintiff was likely underinsured for contents.  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>236.    With respect to the fine art, Chubb has
    failed to provide proof that the plaintiff's fine art claim is fraudulent.
    In fact, Chubb failed to provide an expert opinion challenging the methodology
    used by Elliott to come to his estimate of the value of fine art items. </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>237.    Almost ten years have passed since the fire.
    I find that Chubb's conduct has been malicious, oppressive and high-handed
    and merits the condemnation of the Court.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><b>(6)       Relief from Forfeiture and Costs</b></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge next dealt with the issue of relief from forfeiture.  He found
    at para. 245 that Sagl was a “relative neophyte in matters of insurance”.  Given
    that Chubb did not inspect the property or question the amount of coverage
    requested, the trial judge found if there had been imperfect compliance as
    to the proof of loss or any other matter with respect to the loss, he would
    order relief from forfeiture.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge then dismissed Sagl’s claims against Kinsella, G.C. Carley &amp; Co.
    Limited and Cosburn as well as the cross-claim against Cosburn.  He also
    dismissed the portion of Sagl’s claim for living expenses, but ordered Chubb
    to pay Sagl’s unpaid storage invoice.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    a subsequent endorsement as to costs, the trial judge ordered Chubb to pay
    Sagl’s costs on a substantial indemnity basis due to the fact that Chubb
    failed to prove the allegations of arson and fraud.  He ordered Chubb to
    pay Cosburn’s costs, reasoning that Chubb, at the outset, ought to have assumed
    Cosburn’s defence, but relieved Chubb of having to pay interest on Sagl’s
    storage invoice.</p>

    issued, and, unless so set out, no term of the contract or condition, stipulation,
    warranty or proviso modifying or impairing its effect is valid or admissible

  <h2>VI.       ANALYSIS</h2>
  <h2>(1)       Intentional material misrepresentations in the application</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    starting point in the analysis of this ground of appeal attracts no debate.  The
    relationship between an insurer and an insured is contractual in nature.  But
    contracts of insurance are no ordinary contracts; special rules apply.  Chief
    among these is the doctrine of <i>uberrima fides</i> that holds the parties
    to a standard of utmost good faith in their dealings with each other.  It
    places a heavy burden on applicants for insurance coverage to provide full
    disclosure to the insurance company of all information relevant to the nature
    and extent of the risk that the insurer is being asked to assume: <i>Coronation
    Insurance Co. v. Taku Air Transport Ltd.</i>, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 622, at p.
    636.  A fact is relevant or material if it would influence a prudent insurer
    in deciding whether to issue the policy or in determining the amount of the
    premium:  <i>Mutual Life Insurance Co. v. Ontario Metal Products Co. Ltd.</i>,
    [1925] 1 D.L.R. 583 (P.C.), at p. 588; <i>Gauvremont v. Prudential Insurance
    Co. of America</i>, [1941] S.C.R. 139, at p. 160; <i>Fidelity &amp; Casualty
    Co. of New York v. General Structures Inc.</i>, [1977] 2 S.C.R. 1098, at
    p. 1110.  Whether a misrepresentation or non-disclosure is material is a
    matter of fact to be determined by the trier of fact: see s. 124(6) of the <i>Insurance
    Act</i>, and <i>Mutual Life</i> at p. 588.  However, there is a subjective
    element to the test as well.  The non-disclosure or misrepresentation must
    have induced the insurer to enter into the contract:  see s. 124(4) of the <i>Insurance
    Act</i>; see also <i>Taylor v. London Assurance Corp.</i>, [1935] S.C.R.
    422, at p. 429.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    duty to disclose all material facts applies even in the absence of questions
    from the insurer, although the absence of questions may be evidence that
    the insurer does not consider a fact to be material: <i>Gregory v. Jolley</i> (2001),
    54 O.R. (3d) 481 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), at paras. 31-32 and 37, and <i>W.H. Stuart Mutuals Ltd. v. London Guarantee
    Insurance Co.</i> (2004), 16 C.C.L.I. (4th) 192 (Ont.

    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), at para. 11, leave to appeal refused, [2005] 1 S.C.R. xvii.  The consequence
    of non-disclosure or misrepresentation of a material fact by the insured
    is that the insurer is entitled to void the insurance contract <i>ab initio</i>:
    see <i>Lloyd’s London, Non-Marine Underwriters v. National Armoured Ltd.</i>,
    (1996) 142 D.L.R. (4th) 506 (Ont. Gen. Div.), affirmed by [2000] I.L.R. I-3751

style='"Times New Roman"'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    key issue in this case is materiality. While Chubb argues that the trial
    judge effectively relieved Sagl of her utmost good faith obligation to disclose
    facts within her knowledge material to the risk being assumed and reversed
    the onus of proving material fact disclosure, in actuality Chubb is challenging
    the trial judge’s finding of fact that the information at issue was not material
    to Chubb.  The real inquiry is therefore the legitimacy of that finding.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    would not give effect to this ground of appeal. The trial judge’s finding
    that the facts upon which Chubb relied were not material to its decision
    to provide insurance coverage to Sagl was supported by the evidence and should
    not be interfered with by this court.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Chubb
    argues that the record contains evidence supporting the conclusion that Sagl,
    during her dealings with Kinsella in applying for insurance, failed to disclose
    that (i) she was not the sole owner of 2415 Doulton Drive; (ii) there were
    several mortgages on the property that were in default; and (iii) rather
    than being wealthy, she was in financial distress.  Chubb goes on to say
    that the evidence of Chubb’s witnesses demonstrated that this undisclosed
    information would have been relevant to its decision whether to insure Sagl’s
    home, contents, jewelry, and artwork, largely because of the concern that
    the insurance policy could be used as a way for Sagl to escape from her precarious
    financial position; that is, the undisclosed information was relevant to
    whether Sagl was a moral hazard.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Sagl
    denies that she was in serious financial distress at that time, and points
    out that Chubb assumed the risk without asking for information about the
    issues upon which it now relies to void the policy.  Regarding Sagl’s financial
    status, Hannah Springer of Chubb testified that she was informed by John
    Fountain of Cosburn that Sagl was independently wealthy, and would be receiving
    a substantial matrimonial settlement. After Chubb issued the binder, Kinsella
    filled in an application form on Sagl’s behalf.  Sagl signed it.  Kinsella
    provided it to Connell of Cosburn. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    questions on the minimal form elicited information about Sagl’s name and
    address; the dates during which the policy would be effective; the date on
    which Kinsella had seen the property; the length of time for which Kinsella
    had known Sagl; the fact that he had done business with her before; the fact
    that the residence was a detached, primary occupancy, brick veneer dwelling;
    and the fact that there had been no losses or claims within the past five
    years.  The “loss payee” section was left blank.  In addition, the form did
    not contain any questions regarding ownership of the property, or ask specific
    questions about mortgages, or mortgage default, or whether the applicant
    had any other debts. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Sagl’s
    point is that from the time Chubb issued the binder until the date of the
    fire, some eleven weeks, Chubb agreed to provide Sagl with extensive coverage
    without having any information other than the limited amount contained in
    the application form and that communicated to Springer by Fountain.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    previously mentioned in para. 52, while the applicant has a duty to disclose
    all material facts, an insurer’s conduct may be relevant to the analysis
    of whether a particular fact is material. An insurer’s failure to ask a question
    may be evidence that the particular insurer does not consider the issue to
    be material, even if, objectively, the information would have been regarded
    as relevant by a prudent insurer:  see <i>Great Northern Insurance Co. v.
    Whitney</i> (1918), 57 S.C.R. 543; see also <i>Fordorchuk v. Car &amp; General
    Ins. Corp. Ltd.</i>, [1931] 3 D.L.R. 387 (
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Alta. S.C.), at p. 390, citing <i>Newsholme Bros. v. Road Transport and General
    Insurance Co.</i>, [1929] 2 K.B. 356, where, at p. 363, the court stated
    that insurance companies “run the risk of the contention that matters they
    do not ask questions about are not material, for, if they were, they would
    ask questions about them.”   An insurer who accepts the risk without requiring
    an answer to a question asked, for example by not pursuing an unanswered
    question in an application form, has been found to have waived the question:
    see <i>Hamzeh v. Safeco Insurance Company of America </i>(1988), <a name="OLE_LINK1">32
    C.C.L.I. 83 </a>(Alta. Q.B.).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    recent decision by this court has confirmed the principles expressed in those
    cases.  In <i>Gregory v. Jolley</i>,<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

    Julio Menezes, <i>Insurance Law in Canada</i>, looseleaf (Toronto: Thomson
    Carswell, 2002)<i> </i>with approval:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The significance of the insurer not insisting upon
    a written application, in my view, is similar to the failure of an insurer
    to ask a question on the application.  As Brown points out, at p. 5-4, the
    insurer’s failure to inquire may provide evidence that the insurer does not
    consider the information relevant.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Here,
    Chubb insured Sagl’s home and property for a considerable amount and for
    a considerable period of time without making any inquiries about ownership
    of the property, the status of mortgages, or the existence of other debts,
    and in the face of an incomplete application form obtained only after the
    binder was issued.  Chubb now purports to rely on its lack of knowledge of
    these matters in support of its position that the binder is void due to non-disclosure.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    agree with the trial judge that it runs contrary to the good faith obligation
    that the insurer owes to the insured for the insurer to agree to insure a
    risk, whether at the binder stage or at the time the policy is issued, when
    it knows or should know that there is information relevant to the risk that
    it does not have and that it did not even inquire into or that is incomplete,
    and then to raise the lack of information as a defence to a claim under the
    policy.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Through
    his reasons, the trial judge implicitly put the following question to Chubb:
    if it regarded these facts as material, why did it not ask about them? Given
    that that question was left unanswered by the evidence, it was open to the
    trial judge to draw the inference that the undisclosed matters upon which
    Chubb now relies to void the coverage provided by the binder were not material
    to its decision to issue the binder and assume a sizable risk. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    note that the trial judge, at paras. 150-151, goes further and states that
    the insurer must advise the applicant not only of what it considers to be
    material to the risk, but also of the consequences of concealment or misrepresentation.  I
    am not to be taken as agreeing with that statement of the law.  However,
    it is unnecessary to consider it given my conclusion on the issue of materiality.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Chubb
    had to satisfy the trial judge, on the evidence, that the information Sagl
    allegedly intentionally misrepresented or withheld was material to its assumption
    of the risk.  This, it did not do.  I would therefore not give effect to
    this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h2>(2)       Does s. 124 of the <i>Insurance Act</i> apply to the binder?</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Before
    examining Sagl’s proof of loss, it is necessary to consider whether s. 124
    of the <i>Insurance Act</i> applies to the binder, since the answer to this
    question will determine the extent of Sagl’s coverage.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Chubb
    contends that the extent of coverage initially provided by the binder was
    subsequently reduced as a result of certain agreements reached in discussions
    between Kinsella and Sagl with the objective of reducing Sagl’s premiums.  Sagl’s
    response to this position focuses on s. 124 of the <i>Insurance Act</i>.  She
    points out that none of these discussions, even those that may have resulted
    in some form of agreement between her and Kinsella that would have reduced
    Chubb’s exposure to this claim, were reduced to writing and signed by her.  Sagl
    argues that Chubb is precluded from relying on any orally agreed-upon modifications
    by reason of the application of s. 124 of the Act.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is common ground that the purpose of this section is to protect an insured
    from unilateral changes to an insurance policy.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Chubb
    argues that the trial judge erred in applying s. 124 of the<i> </i>Act to
    a binder of insurance, as opposed to an issued policy.  Essentially, Chubb
    argues that although changes to formal polices of insurance must be agreed
    upon in writing, it is entitled to rely on oral changes made to a binder
    prior to the issuance of the formal policy, as binders are often created
    instantaneously in circumstances where only the outline of a contract is
    discussed and the contract is therefore subject to change.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    cannot accept this position.  In my view, it is clear from the language and
    the definitions in the <i>Insurance Act </i>that s. 124 applies to binders.  Thus,
    changes to the binder of insurance must be agreed upon in writing in order
    to be enforceable and Chubb should not be entitled to rely on any oral changes
    made to the binder prior to the issuance of the formal policy.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Chubb’s
    position is in conflict with the clear language of the <i>Insurance Act</i>.  It
    is apparent that s. 124 applies to binders of insurance, commonly referred
    to as “interim receipts”.  Section 1 of the Act defines a “contract” as a
    contract of insurance, including “a policy, certificate, <i>interim receipt</i>,
    renewal receipt, or writing evidencing the contract, whether sealed or not,
    and a binding oral agreement” (emphasis added).  Since a “contract of insurance”
    is explicitly defined as including binders, it is clear that the writing
    requirement applies to binders.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    view is supported by a review of other provisions in the Act.  Had it been
    intended that the writing requirement would apply only after the issuance
    of a formal policy of insurance, the drafters of the legislation would have
    made that intention plain, as they did in other parts of the Act.  For example,
    in Part IV – Fire Insurance, s. 148 requires that certain statutory conditions
    be printed in every policy of fire insurance.  Subsection (2) explicitly
    provides that the term “policy” “does not include<span
style='color:black;'> interim receipts or binders.”  A similar obligation to
    include statutory conditions in every policy of automobile insurance is imposed
    by s. 234 under Part VI – Automobile Insurance.  Again, subsection (4) of
    s. 234 explicitly states that, under this section, “policy”
    “does not include an interim receipt or binder.”  Chubb’s argument that binders
    are excluded from the writing requirements under s. 124 would require this
    court to read similar language into the statute.    </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    these reasons, I would reject this ground of appeal.  </p>
  <h2>(3)       The insured’s proof of loss</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    regard to this ground of appeal, the inquiry focuses on the trial judge’s
    analysis of Chubb’s position that Sagl should be denied recovery because
    she either did not prove her claim, or she overstated it.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      order to recover for a loss, the onus is on the insured to establish, on
      a balance of probabilities, that the loss occurred and the amount of the
      loss. The onus does not shift to the insurer merely because the insurer
      raises the defence of fraud: <i>Shakur v. Pilot Insurance Co</i>. (1990),
      74 O.R. (2d) 673 (Ont.

    is common ground that in the preparation of the proof of loss, an insured
    owes a duty to the insurer of honesty and accuracy. Indeed, the policy in
    this case, reproduced above at para. 30, expressly states that the policy
    is void if the insured “intentionally concealed or misrepresented any material
    fact relating to this policy before or after a loss.” Once fraud is established,
    no matter the amount, the entire claim under the proof of loss is forfeited: <i>Britton
    v. Royal Insurance</i> (1866), 4 F&amp;F 905 at p. 909; <i>Alavie v. Chubb
    Insurance Co. of Canada</i> (2005), 195 O.A.C. 7 (

style='"Times New Roman"'>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Chubb
    submits that the trial judge erred in two respects in his analysis of its
    proof of loss defence.  First, the trial judge mistakenly relied on the fact
    that Sagl was underinsured.  Second, Sagl’s credibility was the foundation
    of her proof of loss and the reasons are deficient in that they do not indicate
    how the trial judge resolved the serious challenges to her credibility.  This
    issue was pivotal to the assessment of both whether Sagl fulfilled her obligation
    to establish the amount of her loss and Chubb’s defence of intentional overstatement
    of the amount. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    will first deal with Chubb’s argument that the trial judge erred by taking
    into consideration that Sagl was underinsured in concluding that she established
    her loss, and did not overstate its value.  The trial judge observes that
    Sagl’s claim exceeds the amount of coverage in the following passages: </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;'>176.    I have no hesitation

    for Chubb argues that these references should be interpreted as reflecting
    the trial judge’s view that some degree of overstatement, even if fraudulent,
    would not serve to vitiate the policy, as long as the actual loss exceeded
    the coverage.  In other words, only if the trial judge were to find that
    Sagl intentionally overstated her claim and that Chubb’s actual exposure
    fell below the policy limits, would such overstatement be of concern.            </p>

    Chubb’s interpretation of the trial judge’s reasoning is correct, it is clear
    that fraud in connection with any part of the claim will void the entire
    policy, and the fact that the insured may be underinsured has no relevance:  <i>Swan

    even if the trial judge’s reasoning in this respect was flawed, he separately
    considered whether Chubb had established that Sagl intentionally overvalued
    the amount of her loss.  The trial judge rejected Chubb’s position on this
    issue at paras. 212-213:</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>212.    There is no evidence in the Sagl case
    that the plaintiff has intentionally put forward false evidence.</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>213.    The plaintiff, to the best of her knowledge
    and memory, prepared a list of her fine art lost or damaged in the fire.
    The plaintiff retained Elliott to prepare a replacement cost estimate for
    the lost items. Elliott utilized a certain methodology to come to his values
    which he does not warrant as being true or accurate. Chubb presented no expert
    report to refute Elliott's methodology or conclusions.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>These
    two paragraphs form the basis of the second part of Chubb’s argument that
    the trial judge erred in his analysis of Sagl’s proof of loss, as implicit
    in them is the trial judge’s conclusion that Sagl’s evidence in support of
    her proof of loss was both credible and reliable.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[83]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> Chubb
    submits that the trial judge erred by not dealing with the challenges to
    Sagl’s credibility.  An understanding of the significance of this issue depends
    on the answers to three questions.  Was Sagl’s credibility relevant to the
    trial judge’s consideration of her proof of loss? If this question is answered
    in the affirmative, did the trial judge explicitly or implicitly adequately
    address the challenges to her credibility? If this second question is answered
    in the negative, what are the consequences for the purposes of this appeal?  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[84]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    to the first point, there can be no doubt that Sagl’s credibility was intertwined
    with every major aspect of the decision; the proof of loss was no exception.
    It follows that in order to consider Sagl’s obligation to prove her loss
    and Chubb’s argument that she intentionally misrepresented the amount of
    the loss in relation to the value of the contents of the home and her fine
    art collection, the trial judge had to address the challenges to her credibility.
    And those challenges were significant.  For example:         </p>

    admitted under oath to the trial judge that she had lied under oath in an
    earlier proceeding when she had a motive to do so.  She admitted to having
    given false testimony in her matrimonial trial concerning the value of her
    property. That is, it was in her interest to devalue her property in order
    to obtain a larger equalization payment from Rudy Sagl, and she perjured
    herself in pursuit of that goal. </p>

    Sagl maintained that she owned highly valuable pieces and that collecting
    art had been a passionate interest of hers for many years, she was only able
    to testify in generalities about her art collection.  In her testimony at
    trial, she failed to demonstrate knowledge of the components of her collection,
    their provenance or their worth.  She claimed she had received several “Old
    Masters” from her grandfather, but could not identify a single one of them
    in Elliott’s report. <a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

    put forward Darragh Elliott, her expert on the value of her fine art claim,
    not only to Chubb, but also to the court.  In both his report and his testimony,
    Elliott emphasized that he merely appraised, but did not authenticate, Sagl’s
    artwork. He conducted all of his appraisals on the assumption that each piece
    of art was authentic, or in other words, on the assumption that it was precisely
    what Sagl claimed it was. At trial, there were serious issues regarding Elliott’s
    credentials, expertise, methodology and objectivity.<a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

    of the art work destroyed in the fire included hundreds of paintings by Ruth
    von Bismark, which were the subject of a previous lawsuit between von Bismark
    and Sagl.<a

    von Bismark, filed Elliott’s appraisal report from this action, and sought
    to rely on it as evidence of the value of her paintings. In that trial, it
    was in Sagl’s interests to devalue the von Bismark paintings as she was being
    sued for their value.  Accordingly, Elliott and Sagl resiled from the values
    Elliott had assigned to the von Bismark paintings in Sagl’s proof of loss.  They
    then, of course, supported them again in the trial of this action.  This
    discrepancy gave rise to further concerns about the credibility of both Elliott
    and Sagl.</p>

    last two items of particular concern in terms of the credibility of Sagl’s
    evidence upon which she relied to establish her loss pertains to her preparedness
    to ask Chubb and the court to rely on Elliott’s valuation of her fine art
    claim.  The duties and responsibilities of experts are set out in <i>National
    Justice Compania Naviera SA v. Prudential Assurance Co Ltd.</i> <i>(The
    &quot;Ikarian Reefer&quot;)</i>, [1993] 2 Lloyd's Rep 68 (Q.B.), at pp. 81-82,
    and were substantially endorsed by the Court of Appeal at [1995] 1 Lloyd's
    Rep 455, at p. 496. The first two duties listed, which are the most relevant
    in this context, are as follows:</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;'><span style='"Times New Roman"'>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Expert

    expert witness should provide independent assistance to the court by way

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[86]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> As
    previously mentioned, Elliott’s expert report was essential and formed approximately
    two  hundred pages of Sagl’s approximately four hundred page proof of loss.  Sagl
    solemnly declared under oath that the proof of loss was true and presented
    it to Chubb in support of her position that her total loss for the artwork
    was in excess of $9,000,000.    However, the trial judge failed to explain
    why he accepted the values Sagl, through Elliott, attributed to the art work,
    despite the problems with their evidence. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[87]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    cannot be said that these challenges to the evidence relied upon by Sagl
    related only to trivial details. First, Sagl’s proof of loss depended on
    the overall credibility and reliability of the list of items she provided
    to Elliott.  Second, there were legitimate concerns about Sagl’s willingness
    to put forward Elliott as a credible, reliable and objective expert to support
    the values she submitted to Chubb and then to assist the court in its difficult
    task of assessing whether she had proved the amount of her loss and, separately,
    whether Chubb had made out a case of intentional overstatement.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[88]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Against
    this background, it was incumbent upon the trial judge to explain, even in
    succinct terms, how he resolved the challenges to the credibility and reliability
    of the evidence upon which Sagl relied in support of the amount of her loss,
    particularly in the light of his own concern expressed at para. 195, where
    he states: “I have some difficulty comprehending how the plaintiff could
    remember 2,580 items, especially those that were not on display at 2415 but
    were in storage areas.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[89]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    now turn to the next question, namely, whether the trial judge in fact considered
    these challenges.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[90]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    start with the observation that the trial judge did not explicitly analyze
    Sagl’s credibility, or the reliability of her evidence.  In fact, the word “credibility” cannot
    be found anywhere in the 261 paragraphs of the reasons for judgment.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[91]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>But
    that is not the end of the inquiry.  Case law makes it clear that a trial
    judge’s reasons should not be viewed on a stand-alone basis. What is necessary
    is an examination as to whether the reasons, considered in the context of
    the entire record, show that the trial judge has “seized the substance of
    the matter”: <i>R. v. R.E.M.</i> (2008), 235 C.C.C. (3d) 290 (S.C.C.), at
    para. 43. In my view, the analysis must continue, therefore, into whether
    the record demonstrates that the trial judge implicitly and adequately dealt
    with the challenges to Sagl’s evidence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[92]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Considering
    Sagl’s evidence alone, I have been unable to find anything in the record
    that indicates that the trial judge explicitly or implicitly considered the
    challenges to Sagl’s credibility and found her to have been credible in setting
    out her claim for losses associated with the contents of the property and
    with her jewelry.  There are, however, two sentences in the portion of the
    reasons dealing with her claim for loss to her fine art collections that
    may suggest that the trial judge accepted Sagl as a credible witness.  I
    refer to para. 212, where the trial judge states: “There is no evidence in
    the Sagl case that the plaintiff has intentionally put forward false evidence.” Similarly,
    at para. 213 he states: “<span lang=EN-US>The plaintiff, to the best of her
    knowledge and memory, prepared a list of her fine art lost or damaged in
    the fire.” </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[93]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>These
      sentences may go no further than saying that Sagl acted in good faith in
      putting together the inventory of fine art.  However, they may go further
      and indicate that the trial judge believed the accuracy and reliability
      of the list. Either way, t</span>here is a problem.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[94]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span> It
    is not apparent <i>why</i> the trial judge considered Sagl’s evidence, including
    her reliance on Elliott, worthy of belief.  Whether the trial judge was obliged
    to explain this depends upon whether, without addressing this issue, his
    reasons were adequate.</p>

    that court affirmed the framework for assessing whether the trial judge’s
    reasons are so inadequate that they warrant appellate intervention in<i> R.E.M. </i>and
    in <i>R. v. H.S.B</i> (2008), 235 C.C.C. (3d) 312 (S.C.C.), and in the civil

    my view, the trial judge fell into error by failing to explain how he reconciled
    the obvious problems associated with Sagl’s credibility and reliability,
    especially given the challenges to the authenticity, contents and values
    of the inventory she provided to Elliott and with her willingness to ask
    the trial judge to accept Elliott and his report as supporting her claim
    that the value of her art collection lost in the fire was in excess of $9,000,000.  As
    noted in <i>Sheppard</i>, at para. 46, where “the path taken by the trial
    judge through confused or conflicting evidence is not at all apparent,…the
    appeal court may in some cases consider itself unable to give effect to the
    statutory right of appeal”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[100]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    is the situation here; the unarticulated basis of the trial judge’s conclusions,
    if any, concerning Sagl’s reliability, credibility, and her willingness to
    put forward a proof of loss that depended on Elliott, is certainly not apparent
    from the record.  Therefore, the basis of the trial judge’s acceptance of
    her evidence supporting the amount of her loss cannot be ascertained.  In
    short, the trial judge’s reasons fail to satisfy the second purpose articulated
    in <i>F.H. v. McDougall</i>; that is, they fail to explain <i>why</i> the
    trial judge accepted Sagl’s evidence as to her loss in the light of the myriad
    problems with her credibility and reliability. This amounts to reversible
    error, and in my view, taken alone is a sufficient reason to order a new
    trial. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Another
    aspect of the trial judge’s analysis of Chubb’s fraudulent proof of claim
    defence requires comment. The trial judge appears to have analyzed Chubb’s
    defence in respect to the proof of loss on the basis that it was required
    to call expert evidence that Sagl overvalued her loss: </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;'>206.    My problem is, that
    Chubb, for whatever reason, chose not to have Sweeting review Elliott’s report
    and prepare a rebuttal report.  I have <i>no basis</i> upon which to find
    that Elliott’s methodology is either flawed or fraudulent.  Elliott’s report
    may be flawed but that does not make his estimate of the value of the fine
    art fraudulent. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[102]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge erred in curtailing his analysis of Sagl’s proof of loss for
    the reason that Chubb did not call expert evidence to refute Elliott’s valuation
    of Sagl’s fine art collection, and in concluding that therefore he had “no
    basis”
    upon which to find that Elliott’s valuation was flawed.  I say this for three
    reasons.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[103]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    most significant is that the conclusion demonstrates that the trial judge’s
    reasoning missed an essential step in the analysis of Sagl’s evidence in
    relation to her loss.  Before turning to whether Chubb had proved that Elliott’s
    valuation was flawed, the trial judge first had to satisfy himself that Sagl
    had proved, on balance, that her evidence in support of her loss was credible
    and reliable.  In ignoring this step the trial judge effectively relieved
    Sagl of her burden to establish the existence and the amount of her loss,
    as discussed above at para. 75.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[104]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    there is no legal requirement to call expert evidence.  If a trier of fact
    is able to form a conclusion without help, then an expert opinion is unnecessary: <i>R.
    v. Mohan</i>, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 9, at p. 24; <i>R. v. Parrott</i>, [2001] 1
    S.C.R. 178, at para. 53.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[105]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge was required to critically examine the evidence in support of
    Sagl’s loss in relation to her art, even without the assistance of an expert.  And
    he had much to examine.  There was the improbability of Sagl’s own evidence
    about her art, aptly illustrated by her claim to have been able to remember
    2,580 paintings in her home, most of which were stored away in closets, and
    by her claim to have had a US$600,000 Rodin sculpture, for which she paid
    an experienced art dealer $6,500, hidden in her basement, that no one had
    ever seen and that she had not previously disclosed to anyone. Then there
    was the fact that Elliott’s independence was plagued by serious and obvious
    issues, as previously mentioned. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[106]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>   Third,
    placing this much importance on expert evidence promotes a “contest of experts”,
    which the Supreme Court of Canada discouraged in <i>R. v. Mohan</i> at p.
    24. More recently, the Honourable Coulter A. Osborne expressed similar concerns
    with the
    “merry-go-round” created by the “battle of competing experts” at p. 71 of
    his report, <i>Civil Justice Reform Project: Summary of Findings and Recommendations </i>(November
    2007).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[107]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    feel obliged to comment on one further aspect of the trial judge’s analysis
    of this aspect of Chubb’s defence, namely, his treatment of Chubb’s argument
    that Sagl inflated the value of her art work and contents.  In order to vitiate
    a policy for fraud, the insured must have made a wilfully false statement
    in relation to something material to the proof of either the existence or
    extent of the loss, which would include intentionally inflated values.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[108]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge commented as follows, at paras. 204-205, when considering Chubb’s
    defence that Sagl had overstated the value of her art collection:</p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>204.     I am not sure what a “material fact” would
    be in relation to the fine art claim.  I suggest if the plaintiff represented
    that a particular painting was done by a famous artist but was actually done
    by an amateur, that would be an intentional misrepresentation.<u></u></p>
  <p style='text-align:justify'>205.     Here, Chubb’s main concern appears to
    be allegations of inflated values.  But, the value given to a particular
    item of fine art depends on the methodology used and the value determined
    is a matter of opinion.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[109]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Earlier,
    at para. 192, the trial judge expressed the difficulty he had in determining
    whether Sagl had inflated the value of her art collection:</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;'>192.    Even with existing
    pieces of fine art, who knows their true value? For example, there are individual
    paintings which have sold for millions of dollars. But, are those paintings
    worth the price? The price is in the mind and eyes of the beholder!</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[110]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge appears to be of the view that the value of art cannot be inflated
    as it is in the eye of the beholder. This is incorrect.  With appropriate
    evidence, it clearly is possible to assign a fair market value to art.  It
    was incumbent on the trial judge to consider and fairly assess all of the
    evidence in relation to the valuation of the art collections in order to
    decide whether Sagl established the amount of her loss.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    follows that, in my view, there were a number of problems associated with
    the trial judge’s analysis of Sagl’s claim for loss resulting from the fire.  However,
    the fundamental reason why I would allow the appeal and order a new trial
    on that issue is that the trial judge did not articulate how he resolved
    credibility concerns, specifically how he found Sagl’s evidence in support
    of the loss to her fine art collections worthy of belief, in order for him
    to determine whether Sagl had proved her claim. This constitutes reversible
    error.  </p>
  <h2>(4)       Relief from Forfeiture</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[112]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    para. 247 of his reasons, the trial judge held that “[i]f there had been
    ‘…imperfect compliance…as to the proof of loss…given by the insured or other
    matter or thing required to be done or omitted by the insured with respect
    to the loss…’”, he would order relief against forfeiture pursuant to s. 129
    of the <i>Insurance Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[113]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    have difficulty with the trial judge’s treatment of this issue, for two reasons.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[114]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    the trial judge erred in relying on <i>Chung v. British Columbia Insurance
    Co.</i> (1996), 36 C.C.L.I. (2d) 158 (B.C. Sup.
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ct.), in respect of this issue, as it is not on point. That case dealt with
    the duties owed by an insured’s agent to the insured. It addressed neither
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    British Columbia’s equivalent of s. 129, nor the factors to be considered
    when determining whether to grant relief from forfeiture.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[115]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    based on the evidence adduced at trial, relief from forfeiture was not in
    issue.  The divide between the parties in respect of the proof of loss had
    nothing to do with whether Sagl’s claim suffered from “imperfect compliance”.   Rather
    it was whether Sagl had proved her loss and whether that loss was intentionally
    overstated. </p>
  <h2> (5)      Punitive Damages </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[116]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    view of the fact that I would order a new trial, it is neither necessary
    nor appropriate to deal with Chubb’s arguments concerning punitive damages.  Accordingly,
    I express no view on this issue.</p>
  <h2>VII.    DISPOSITION </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[117]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    these reasons, I would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment below and
    order a new trial restricted solely to the issue of Sagl’s proof of loss,
    specifically whether she is able to prove her loss in relation to her fine
    arts collection, and whether the policy is void due to intentional misrepresentation
    in the proof of loss. If appropriate, the new trial would include a consideration
    of the application of s. 129 of the <i>Insurance Act.</i></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[118]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Chubb
    shall make written submissions on the costs of the trial and of the appeal
    within twenty days of the release of these reasons. Sagl shall deliver responding
    submissions within ten days thereafter.</p>
