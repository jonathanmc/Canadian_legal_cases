  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>By the Court:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      On
    this appeal from conviction for first degree murder and arson by Thomson
    J. and a jury, the appellant raises two grounds of appeal.  He submits that
    the trial judge did not adequately direct the jury with respect to after-the-fact
    conduct and misdirected the jury with respect to the “defence” of suicide.  For
    the following reasons, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      On
    January 9, 2001, a fire occurred at the home the appellant shared with his
    wife Charlene and their children.  The children were at school at the time
    of the fire.  Charlene died in the fire.  By the end of the trial, there
    was no dispute that the fire had been deliberately set.  The issue was whether
    the Crown had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant set the
    fire.  The defence position was that the deceased set the fire.  The defence
    suggested that the deceased set the fire as an act of suicide and revenge.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    prosecution case was formidable.  The location of the fire and the position
    of the body made any possibility of accident extremely unlikely.  Similarly,
    the suicide theory, which depended almost entirely on the appellant’s evidence,
    was a weak one.  Firefighters arrived at the home within minutes of the fire
    being seen by neighbours.  They found the deceased lying naked in the bedroom
    in circumstances suggesting that she had just come from a bath.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    Crown also relied on evidence of motive.  The appellant had just lost his
    employment and was in serious financial straits.  He had recently increased
    the insurance on the deceased’s life.  He was in a relationship with another
    woman and wanted to leave the deceased.  In the weeks prior to the fire,
    the appellant had moved some of his most important possessions, in particular,
    a cherished automobile, away from the house.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      There
    was evidence of opportunity.  There was no contest that only the deceased
    and the appellant had the opportunity to set the fire.  The prosecution adduced
    evidence from neighbours showing that the appellant left the house a short
    time before the fire was discovered.  On the other hand, the appellant testified
    and not only denied setting the fire but claimed that he had left the house
    at a time inconsistent with when the fire must have been set.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      Finally,
    the Crown relied upon a substantial body of after-the-fact conduct.  For
    example, after the fire, the appellant instructed the woman with whom he
    had an intimate relationship to destroy the clothing that he had left at
    her house.  The appellant explained that he knew she wanted to keep the relationship
    private and that he was also feeling guilty about the affair. Several weeks
    later, after the appellant was charged with setting the fire and murdering
    his wife and while he was in custody, the appellant chose to give a lengthy
    and detailed statement to an insurance adjuster that contained several lies
    or mistakes.  One admitted lie was that he told the adjuster that on the
    day of the fire gasoline had spilled in the garage.  He said that the children
    had walked through the gasoline and then walked through the house leaving
    gasoline on the carpet.  The appellant speculated that the deceased might
    have set the fire when she accidentally knocked a candle over and onto the
    carpet.  The appellant admitted this was untrue.  He explained that he told
    the lie because if the insurance adjuster knew the deceased had deliberately
    set the fire, he would not get the insurance proceeds.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    appellant also gave the adjuster a detailed outline of his whereabouts during
    the morning of the fire.  The appellant gave a somewhat similar chronology
    at trial and claimed that any discrepancies in the statement were simply
    the result of confusion or mistake. It was open to the jury to find that
    the chronology in the appellant’s statement to the insurance adjuster was
    wrong and it was the theory of the prosecution that the appellant had concocted
    the chronology to show that he was away from the house at the time the fire
    was started.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    defence position on suicide by the end of the trial rested on the appellant’s
    evidence that on the morning of the fire he had a serious argument with the
    deceased.  He told her that she would get nothing when they divorced, that
    she would have to leave the house, and that the children would stay with
    him.  She responded that she would burn the house down before he would get
    anything.  The deceased was livid and not making any sense.  It was the defence
    position that the deceased, despondent at the end of the marriage and the
    prospect of losing her house and children, set the fire to commit suicide
    and deprive the appellant of the house.  There was little other evidence
    to suggest that the deceased was in a suicidal state of mind. Although there
    was some evidence from her family and acquaintances suggesting that she was
    upset over certain issues, taken as a whole such evidence did not suggest
    that she was so despondent as to be suicidal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      While
    this is a relatively brief review of the facts it will suffice for the purposes
    of understanding the two grounds of appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>1.         The Trial Judge’s Expression of Opinion</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his factum, the appellant raised as a ground of appeal the trial judge’s
    strong expression of opinion in his charge to the jury about the appellant’s
    lack of credibility.  In oral argument, Mr. Schreck did not raise this as
    an independent ground of appeal, conceding that on its own, this ground of
    appeal could not succeed. We have, however, taken the entire charge into
    account, including the trial judge’s expression of opinion, in considering
    the remaining two grounds of appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>2.         The Charge to the Jury on After-the-Fact Conduct</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After-the-fact
    conduct was an important aspect of the prosecution case.  The principal complaint
    by the appellant is that the charge to the jury did not make clear the distinction
    between mere disbelief of the statement to the insurance adjuster and fabrication
    or concoction.  Only if the jury found that the statement to the insurance
    adjuster was fabricated was it capable of constituting circumstantial evidence
    of guilt:  <i>R. v. O’Connor</i> (2003), 62 O.R. (3d) 263 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also submits that the charge would have left the jury with the
    impression that if they disbelieved the appellant’s trial evidence that too
    could constitute after-the-fact conduct.  We see no merit to that submission.  The
    appellant relies on several words in a very long passage dealing with after-the-fact
    conduct.  When that passage is considered with other parts of the charge,
    it would have been obvious to the jury that the trial judge was discussing
    the crucial statement to the insurance adjuster and not the appellant’s trial
    evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>O’Connor</i>,
    the court dealt with the approach to using out-of-court statements as circumstantial
    evidence of guilt.  The court noted that there is a distinction between a
    statement, in that case a statement of an alibi, that is disbelieved and
    one that is concocted or deliberately fabricated.  Importantly, mere disbelief
    of an alibi is not alone sufficient to found an inference of fabrication.  It
    is only where there is independent evidence of fabrication that a false out-of-court
    statement is capable of supporting an inference of guilt.  In some circumstances,
    there will be clear independent evidence of concoction.  This case provides
    an example.  In his testimony, the appellant admitted that he lied to the
    adjuster about the children tracking gasoline through the house in order
    to cover up any deliberate acts by his wife that might have caused the fire
    and that would jeopardize the insurance coverage.  It was for the jury to
    decide what weight to give to his explanation.  If the jury rejected the
    explanation for this fabrication, this was a significant piece of circumstantial
    evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    issue of the alibi was more complicated.  The defence position was that to
    the extent the alibi set out in the statement was inconsistent with other
    evidence accepted by jury, the appellant was simply mistaken.  The appellant
    submits that there was no independent evidence of concoction or fabrication.  The
    appellant’s submissions concerning the adequacy of the charge on after-the-fact
    conduct centre on the trial judge’s treatment of the alibi.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, the Crown founded its theory of fabrication of the alibi on the holding
    in <i>O’Connor</i> that the circumstances in which the statement is given
    can themselves constitute independent evidence of fabrication.  The court
    explained the reasoning as follows at para. 26:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The circumstances in which a false statement is
    made may show an intent to mislead the police or others or an intent to deflect
    suspicion and may be evidence of a conscious mind that he or she has committed
    an offence. When a court is addressing the admissibility of evidence contradicting
    an accused's out-of-court statement, it will be required to determine if
    there is independent evidence of fabrication, but in doing so, the court
    may consider the circumstances in which the allegedly false statement was
    made. If those circumstances tend to support a conclusion that the accused
    made a false statement because he or she was conscious of having committed
    the offence, then those circumstances may be used as independent evidence
    of fabrication.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    court at para. 31 explained how in that case the circumstances were capable
    of constituting independent evidence of fabrication:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In this case, it is my view that the circumstances
    in which the appellant made the allegedly false statements to the police
    and the detailed nature of those statements constitute sufficient evidence
    upon which a jury could conclude that the appellant fabricated the statements
    in order to mislead the police and divert suspicion from himself. <i>His
    first statement was made the same day as the shooting and, importantly, was
    made to the police at a time when the police did not suspect the appellant
    and the appellant did not have reason to believe that he was a suspect.</i> The
    police, as a matter of routine, questioned witnesses who might have information
    about the deceased's whereabouts prior to the shooting. The appellant's initial
    statement furnished a complete alibi and, if true, would lead the police
    to conclude that he was not involved in the offence. <i>That statement and
    the next two statements were very precise, both as to the appellant's whereabouts
    and the times he was in the various places. If the jury were to disbelieve
    the appellant's statements, they might fairly ask why would the appellant
    tell such detailed and specific lies to the investigators.</i> Why not tell
    the truth? <i>And how was it that the appellant was so well prepared with
    a detailed and precise statement about his whereabouts when questioned by
    the police?</i> In my view, it would be open to a jury to use the evidence
    of the circumstances surrounding the making of those statements and the nature
    of the statements themselves to conclude that the appellant fabricated the
    statements to avoid suspicion. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the circumstances in this case are far removed from <i>O’Connor</i> and
    not capable of constituting independent evidence of fabrication.  He points
    out that when he gave the statement he was not a mere witness, but was charged
    with first degree murder and there could be reasons why he lied that were
    inconsistent with guilt, such as a fear of being wrongly convicted. The trial
    judge charged the jury as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There is a difference between evidence leading
    only to disbelief of an accused statement and independent evidence of fabrication
    and concoction determined from the circumstances of the taking of the statement
    and the detail in it. Simply because the alibi is disbelieved that fact can’t
    be used to draw a negative inference in the absence of the finding of fabrication
    and concoction.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Now what that means is you’ve got to look at the
    circumstances of the taking of the statement which means when, where, situation,
    all of that sort of thing and the detail in the statement, in other words,
    how precise perhaps it might be. Exact. Now the circumstances surrounding
    the taking of the statement by Ebel on the 28th went something like this.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge then went on to set out at length the circumstances under which
    the statement was made.  He noted, for example, that the appellant was well
    aware of the purpose of the interview, had made the arrangements for when
    the adjuster would interview him, was aware of discussions between his counsel
    and the adjuster, knew he was facing charges of arson and first degree murder,
    and had plenty of time to reflect upon the events that he was going to talk
    about.  The statement itself was very detailed and the appellant gave a precise
    account of his movements on the day of the fire in terms of times and where
    he went.  The statement was detailed in other respects, not alleged to be
    false, such as the state of his finances.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    setting out the chronology of events as set out in the statement, the trial
    judge concluded his instructions as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>So there appears to be 2 different versions of
    where and when he was at different places on the morning of the fire. To
    be clear to you it is not evidence establishing the falsity of the statement
    which constitutes the evidence of fabrication. <i>Rather it is the evidence
    of the circumstances in which the disbelieved statements were made and the
    detailed nature of those statements which is capable of furnishing the independent
    evidence of fabrication and concoction.</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>You may well be able to determine that he was well
    prepared with the detailed and precise statement about his whereabouts when
    he was questioned by Ebel [the insurance adjuster]. It is open to you to
    use the evidence of the circumstances surrounding the making of the statement
    and the nature, the precision and detail themselves to conclude that the
    appellant fabricated the statement to avoid suspicion. It is for you to decide
    if he made his comments to Ebel at that time knowing full well that they
    would deceive and mislead the police as well as the insurance adjuster. <i>If
    you find that he spoke about all kinds of things and did so with considered
    detail precision and accuracy then that raises the question why would he
    not be accurate in his evidence about the time and place that he was when
    he spoke to Ebel on the 28th of February, that is, his recall was excellent
    about all the details so why would he be mistaken about where he was and
    when he was unless if it was fabricated to mislead or deceive.</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>You are the ones to determine if Hazel knew when
    he gave the statement to Ebel that he was making a claim for insurance and
    in effect was providing an alibi for both the murder and the claim for insurance.
    He had to be consistent for both situations. He had to be somewhere else
    when the fire started and he had to explain how the accelerant had to be
    in the house and how the fire started with the candle. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the circumstances under which the statement was made, including
    the advance notice of and opportunity to prepare for the meeting with the
    adjuster, were capable of constituting independent evidence of fabrication.  In
    the first place, the circumstances referred to by the trial judge diminish
    the possibility of mistake or inadvertence.  The appellant not only misled
    the adjuster as to the sequence of events, which of itself may have been
    of no moment, but he also attempted to change the chronology of events to
    have begun almost an hour earlier.  It would be open to the jury to conclude
    that the appellant did so deliberately to distance himself from the igniting
    of the fire and to account for the time needed to dispose of whatever he
    used to light the fire.  We are also of the view that in deciding whether
    the alibi was concocted, the jury could take into account the admitted fabrication
    of the story about the children tracking gasoline into the house.  The fabricated
    story and the alibi were closely connected as they went to the core issue
    of who set the fire.  The jury could find that both stories were intended
    to deflect suspicion from the appellant and were part of a carefully thought
    out plan and, to paraphrase the words of <i>O’Connor</i> above, showed an
    intent to mislead  or to deflect suspicion and were evidence of a mind conscious
    that he had set the fire.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also submits that the trial judge erred in failing to outline the
    appellant’s explanations.  We agree that when reviewing the admitted lie
    about the gasoline being tracked through the house, the trial judge should
    have reminded the jury, at that point, about the appellant’s explanation.  However,
    the trial judge had already fully outlined the explanation during his lengthy
    review of the appellant’s testimony.  Although it would have been preferable
    had the trial judge also reviewed the appellant’s explanation for the discrepancies
    that he made some mistakes in his statement to the insurance adjuster about
    the timing of events on the morning of the fire when dealing with the concoction
    issue, the trial judge referred to this explanation later when setting out
    the position of the defence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge should have also provided the jury
    with alternative explanations for the appellant’s false statements to the
    insurance adjuster.  As this court said in <i>R. v. Peavoy</i> (1997), 34
    O.R. (3d) 620 :</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[After-the-fact conduct] can only be used by the
    trier of fact in this manner if any innocent explanation for the conduct
    is rejected. That explanation may be expressly stated in the evidence, such
    as when the accused testifies, or it may arise from the trier of fact's appreciation
    of human nature and how people react to unusual and stressful situations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    only explanations for the false statements that arose from the evidence were
    that the appellant wanted to deflect suspicion from the deceased having deliberately
    set the fire, and mistake. The appellant’s explanations were simple and straightforward.
    He did not want to jeopardize his insurance claim, so he lied about the children
    tracking in the gasoline. Further, he was confused about the times and sequence
    of events and, like some of the Crown witnesses, made mistakes about the
    times that things happened.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge should also have speculated for the
    jury that there may have been other reasons for the lies to the adjuster,
    such as that the appellant was under stress and, although innocent, was fearful
    that no one would believe him.  We do not accept this submission. The appellant
    did not raise this objection at trial. Given the explanations actually advanced
    by the appellant and the circumstances surrounding the statement (a statement
    to an insurance adjuster as opposed to the police given several weeks after
    the fire), we fail to see how it would have benefited the defence for the
    trial judge to speculate about other explanations that were not advanced
    at trial and could not reasonably be inferred from the evidence.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>3.         The Suicide Theory</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that taken as a whole, the charge to the jury left the
    jury with the impression that the appellant had to establish that the deceased
    committed suicide.  Alternatively, it is submitted that it was never made
    clear that the jury did not have to decide whether or not the deceased committed
    suicide; if in the end they simply were unsure how the deceased died then
    the appellant had to be acquitted.  The appellant submits that possible confusion
    about the burden of proof was exacerbated by some of Crown counsel’s cross-examination.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    will deal with the cross-examination point first.  The appellant submits
    that it was improper for Crown counsel to ask the appellant to comment on
    the deceased’s state of mind.  An example of the kind of question to which
    objection is taken is this:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        Now, Mr. Hazel, does it make any sense
    to you, I know you can’t see into Charlene’s mind but does it make any sense
    to you that Charlene would destroy her kids’ things, all their little treasures,
    all their toys, all their clothes, does it make any sense to you at all?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        At this point a lot of things don’t make
    sense why.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        It doesn’t, does it? It doesn’t make
    any sense does it?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        I had threatened her that morning to
    take the house and to take the children.  That’s all I can say.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for the appellant submits that this cross-examination runs afoul of this
    court’s decision in <i>R. v. Henderson</i> (1999), 44 O.R. (3d) 628, 365:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Crown counsel's questioning required the appellant
    to provide an alternate explanation for the complainant's behaviour that
    was not premised on his guilt. Such an explanation would have required the
    appellant to either comment upon the complainant's credibility or to give
    an opinion that he was clearly not qualified to give, explaining why her
    conduct was inconsistent with someone who had been sexually assaulted. Clearly
    questions of this nature are improper and unfair.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> On
    the facts of this case, in our view, the impugned cross-examination did not
    unfairly prejudice the appellant. The appellant and the deceased were not
    strangers.  The appellant had advanced a suggestion that the deceased was
    suicidal based on his conduct and his observations of her conduct.  But there
    were a number of problems with the appellant’s position in that his evidence
    about the appellant’s conduct seemed inconsistent with what was known about
    the deceased.  It was open to the Crown counsel to explore those inconsistencies
    with the appellant.  When the impugned questions are considered in the context
    of all of the questions he was asked about the deceased’s conduct and circumstances,
    the appellant was not asked to and did not comment on what the deceased was
    thinking or give an opinion he was not qualified to give.  Rather, the Crown
    simply gave the appellant the opportunity to explain the circumstances.  In
    deciding whether the Crown had proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the
    deceased did not commit suicide, the jury would inevitably take into account
    whether such an explanation made sense having regard to all the circumstances.
    Putting those circumstances to the appellant during cross-examination did
    not unfairly prejudice the defence in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  Finally,
    the appellant submits that the charge to the jury may have led the jury to
    believe that they only had two alternatives: either accepting the appellant’s
    evidence of the argument the day of the fire and the deceased’s state of
    mind at that time, or accepting the prosecution evidence that the appellant
    deliberately set the fire.  As pointed out by Martin J.A. in <i>R. v. Nimchuk</i> (1976),
    33 C.C.C. (2d) 209 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), 210: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There was, of course, a third alternative, namely,
    if a reasonable doubt existed, in view of the conflicting testimony, as to
    exactly where the truth of the matter lay, it would, of course, require an
    acquittal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    are satisfied, however, that the instructions in the main part of the charge
    together with the recharge would have left the jury with no doubt that the
    burden was on the Crown to disprove suicide beyond a reasonable doubt.  The
    trial judge gave the jury complete instructions on the presumption of innocence,
    the burden of proof beyond a reasonable doubt and the application of reasonable
    doubt to credibility in accordance with <i>R. v. W. (D.)</i>, [1991] 1 S.C.R.
    742.  The second prong of the <i>W. (D.)</i> instruction is designed in part
    to warn the jury against making the <i>Nimchuk</i> error at least where the
    defence, as here, substantially rests on the accused’s evidence.  The jury
    are told that they do not have to believe the testimony of the accused and
    they must acquit if that testimony leaves them with a reasonable doubt.  In
    our view, the trial judge’s correct instructions in his original charge on
    the application of <i>W. (D.)</i> to the appellant’s evidence respecting
    suicide with the explicit instruction in the recharge that the appellant
    did not have to prove that the deceased did commit suicide and that the Crown
    must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that she did not commit suicide were
    sufficient.  It is not realistic to believe that the jury would have convicted
    the appellant of a planned and deliberate murder if they were unsure how
    the deceased died.</p>
