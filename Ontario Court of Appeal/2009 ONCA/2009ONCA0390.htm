  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant, the Appraisal Institute of Canada, is a not-for-profit corporation
    that regulates the appraisal profession for individuals that qualify and
    subscribe for membership in it.  It sets standards of practice for its members.  It
    supports the standards with a process for disciplining a member who is shown
    to have breached them. It maintains three committees, which each play a part
    in that process: an Investigating Committee, an Adjudicating Committee and
    an Appeal Board.  All three committees are established and regulated by regulations
    made pursuant to the appellant<span lang=EN-US>’s by-laws.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>It
      is uncontested in this appeal that these committees have a duty to deal
      fairly with members against whom complaints have been made.  The issue
      is whether that happened in the respondent’s case.  The trial judge found
      that it did not, and awarded judgment to the respondent.  In my view, he
      erred in doing so, and for the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      respondent is a real estate appraiser.  He is a member of the appellant
      and has been designated by it as an accredited appraiser of the Institute. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      September 1997, the appellant received a complaint from someone for whom
      the respondent had prepared an appraisal report.  It referred the complaint
      to its Investigating Committee.  Pursuant to the relevant regulation, the
      Committee Chair appointed one of its members, James Clark, to investigate.  A
      copy of the complaint was sent to the respondent, and his responses were
      obtained to the questions it raised about his appraisal report.  Mr. Clark
      then prepared a brief for the Investigating Committee.  In it, he reported
      on deficiencies in the respondent’s appraisal report and described the
      discipline charges that he proposed that the Committee recommend in light
      of those deficiencies.  In paragraph 9 of the brief he also described the
      respondent’s response to the investigation as slow and uncooperative, although
      none of his proposed charges were based on this.  Finally, he recommended
      that the respondent receive the discipline of “censure” and be required
      to take some additional courses.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      September 2001, the Investigating Committee, including Mr. Clark, met to
      consider the complaint against the respondent.  Its governing regulation
      provided that it was not required to afford someone in the respondent’s
      position a hearing or an opportunity to make submissions, and it did not
      do so.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      Committee’s report concluded that many, but not all, of the charges proposed
      in Mr. Clark’s brief warranted discipline, and only those that did should
      go forward to the Adjudicating Committee if the respondent did not agree
      to the penalties it proposed.  Its proposed discipline was that the respondent
      should receive a private reprimand (the least onerous sanction possible
      a lesser sanction than recommended by Mr. Clark), some remedial course
      work and should pay costs of $500. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant provided the respondent with a copy of the report of the Investigating
      Committee.  It advised him that if he did not accept the recommended discipline
      he was entitled to a hearing of the charges it recommended before the appellant’s
      Adjudicating Committee. The respondent declined to accept the discipline
      proposed by the Investigating Committee and requested a hearing before
      the Adjudicating Committee.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      regulation governing the Adjudicating Committee requires that it hold a
      hearing in such circumstances.  The Committee that has referred the charge
      to the Adjudicating Committee prosecutes the case and must give prior disclosure
      to the member charged of all the documents it proposes to use.  The member
      has the right to be present, to have counsel, to cross-examine witnesses
      called by the referring committee, to call evidence in reply, and to make
      argument.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      hearing of the Adjudicating Committee took place on May 3, 2002.  The respondent
      was present and represented by counsel.  The Committee had received the
      brief prepared by the Investigating Committee some 30 days earlier.  It
      received the respondent’s brief at the hearing.  The representative of
      the Investigating Committee (not Mr. Clark, who had by then left that Committee)
      gave evidence explaining the reasons for the proposed charges and the proposed
      discipline.  He was subjected to cross-examination by counsel for the respondent.  The
      respondent then gave evidence on his own behalf.  After hearing argument,
      the Adjudicating Committee retired.  On June 26, 2002, it issued its decision,
      finding that 9 of the 12 recommended charges had been proven.  It imposed
      a private reprimand, ordered the respondent to redo the appraisal in compliance
      with current standards, and assessed costs of $2,500 against the respondent.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>As
      he was entitled to under the applicable regulation, the respondent appealed
      to the appellant’s Appeal Committee.  He raised 22 points challenging the
      decision of the Adjudication Committee.  The Appeal Committee held its
      hearing on November 28, 2003.  Again the respondent was represented by
      counsel.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      Appeal Committee issued its decision on January 21, 2004.  It concluded
      that only three of the charges had been proven, but sustained the discipline
      imposed by the Adjudicating Committee save for costs, which it reduced
      to $1,000.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      respondent then commenced this action, seeking to quash the decisions of
      the Appeal Committee and the Adjudicating Committee, an order that he be
      repaid the $1,000 costs he had paid, an injunction preventing further discipline,
      and damages for breach of contract.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      respondent succeeded at trial.  The trial judge found that the appellant
      had an implied contractual obligation to treat the respondent fairly in
      conducting its discipline process.  The trial judge found that this process
      had become fatally flawed at the Investigating Committee stage (and thereafter
      was beyond rehabilitation) because the respondent had a right to a hearing
      at that stage and did not receive it. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge also expressed concern with four other aspects of the discipline
      process:</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>(a)       the inclusion of paragraph 9 in Mr. Clark’s brief to the
      Investigating Committee;</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>(b)       the fact that Mr. Clark participated in the deliberations
      of the Investigating Committee, having prepared the brief being considered
      by it;</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>(c)       the impact that the report of the Investigating Committee
      appeared to have on the final outcome of the discipline process; and</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>(d)       the fact that the Adjudicating Committee received the brief
      of the Investigating Committee some 30 days before it received that of
      the respondent.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      the end, the trial judge ordered that the findings against the respondent
      and the sanctions imposed on him be struck, the costs paid be refunded
      to him, and that he receive costs of the trial fixed at $25,000.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For
      the following reasons, I cannot agree with the order made by the trial
      judge or with his reasoning.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant concedes that its relationship with the respondent is governed
      by contract and that it owes the respondent an implied contractual duty
      of fairness in conducting the various stages of its discipline process.  It
      is therefore unnecessary to determine whether, apart from contract, the
      appellant owes a common law duty of fairness, either because of some element
      of public character it may have, or because of the nature of the discipline
      process it carries on.  The real question is what the duty of fairness
      requires of it at each stage of the discipline process and whether any
      of the aspects of that process that concerned the trial judge can properly
      be said to breach that duty.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Most
      important for the trial judge was the fact that the respondent was not
      accorded a hearing before the Investigating Committee.  In my view, for
      three reasons this did not breach the appellant’s duty to treat the respondent
      fairly.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First,
      the implied contractual obligation of fairness must be informed by the
      meaning of the regulation which the appellant’s by-laws empower it to make
      governing that stage of the discipline process.  The regulation sets out
      how members can expect to be treated.  It expressly provides that the Investigating
      Committee is not required to afford the respondent a hearing.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Second,
      the Investigating Committee can impose no sanction or substantive consequence
      on the respondent.  It can do no more than recommend charges and proposed
      penalties for the Adjudicating Committee to consider.  In other words,
      this stage can impose no sanctions on the respondent.  It can do no more
      than cause a hearing before the Adjudicating Committee. The requirements
      of the duty at this stage are therefore extremely minimal.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Third,
      the respondent was in fact afforded the opportunity at this stage to know
      what the complaint against him was and to respond in writing to Mr. Clark
      about the questions it raised.  Fairness requires no more.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      my view, therefore, the absence of a hearing before the Investigating Committee
      did not deprive the respondent of any element of procedural fairness. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      other four considerations that appeared to have concerned the trial judge
      can be easily dealt with.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>While
      Mr. Clark included paragraph 9 in his brief to the Investigating Committee,
      the adverse comments he made about the respondent’s response to the investigation
      had no consequences for the respondent.  Mr. Clark recommended no charges
      based on these comments.  Nor did the report of the Investigating Committee.  The
      comments were the subject of no further scrutiny in the discipline process.
      They created no fairness obligation that the appellant failed to discharge.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      same is true of Mr. Clark’s participation in the deliberations of the Investigating
      Committee.  The governing regulation authorized the Committee to delegate
      to him the task of investigating but did not preclude his subsequent participation
      in deciding what charges to recommend to the Adjudicating Committee.  That
      task is not quasi-judicial.  Procedural fairness requires no separation
      between this Committee and the individual to whom it has delegated its
      investigation function. Indeed it could properly have conducted the investigation
      itself and then decided what charges to recommend.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      concern about the impact that the Investigating Committee’s report may
      have had on the final outcome of the discipline process also cannot be
      sustained.  It is not suggested that the Adjudicating Committee exhibited
      any bias.  Any impact the report may have had can only have been through
      it being tendered in evidence before the Adjudicating Committee in a hearing
      that accorded the respondent the right to cross-examine and to call evidence
      in response.  In that context, the impact of the Investigating Committee’s
      report could not be a breach of procedural fairness.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally,
      the fact that the Adjudicating Committee received the respondent’s written
      brief only at the hearing, some 30 days after it received the Investigating
      Committee’s brief, does not constitute a breach of the appellant’s duty
      of fairness.  The Adjudicating Committee reserved its decision for almost
      two months. There is no basis to suggest that it did not fully consider
      the respondent’s brief before deciding.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

      summary, I can find no breach by the appellant of its contractual duty
      of fairness.  The appeal must be allowed, the judgment below set aside,
      and the respondent’s action dismissed. Costs of the appeal to the appellant
      fixed at $10,000 inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.  Since the respondent
      abandoned its argument about costs of the trial, there should be no costs
      of the trial to either party.</span></p>
