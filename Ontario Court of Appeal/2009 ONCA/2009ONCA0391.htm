  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>I. Overview</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Heath was injured in a rear-end collision on March 10, 1998. At the time
    of the accident, he was 39 years old and had not worked steadily for several
    years. In addition to suing the owner and the driver of the mini-van that
    hit his car, Mr. Heath started an action against his own insurer for non-earner
    benefits under the <i>Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule--Accidents On
    or After November 1, 1996</i>, O. Reg. 430/96 (the “1996 SABS”). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    a trial in 2006, Kennedy J. granted Mr. Heath’s claim for non-earner benefits
    to the date of his decision and also declared that Mr. Heath’s “entitlement
    to non-earner benefits [shall] continue as long as he remains in the condition
    where he suffers from [a] complete inability to engage in substantially all
    of the activities in which he would ordinarily engage.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Economical
    Mutual Insurance Company raises two main issues on its appeal from the trial
    judge’s order:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did
    the trial judge apply the wrong test for determining whether Mr. Heath is
    entitled to non-earner benefits? </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Was
    there evidence at trial capable of supporting Mr. Heath’s claim for non-earner
    benefits?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal, set aside the trial judge’s
    order and dismiss Mr. Heath’s action. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>II. The Appeal Hearing</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    turning to the issues on appeal, I will explain why we proceeded with the
    appeal hearing in Mr. Heath’s absence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the request of Mr. Heath who indicated that he could not travel to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto for this appeal, due to his medical condition, the appeal was scheduled
    to be heard by video-conference and the parties were to attend at the London
    Courthouse. Mr. Heath was not present when the hearing began. Counsel for
    Economical advised us that Mr. Heath left a message with his office earlier
    in the week indicating that he would not be attending. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Prior
    to hearing argument, the court took a brief recess because we had determined
    that the court of appeal office did not accept for filing various documents
    Mr. Heath had served on counsel for Economical due to non-compliance with
    the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>. When we resumed the hearing, counsel
    for Economical indicated that Mr. Heath had attended the London Courthouse
    during the recess but had elected not to remain. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    it was apparent that Mr. Heath was aware of the hearing but chose not to
    attend, we proceeded with the hearing in his absence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Heath wrote to the court after the appeal was heard. His material does not
    satisfy the requirements for making submissions following an appeal hearing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>III. Background</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>            i) The accident</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Heath’s car was struck from the rear by a mini-van while stopped at a stop
    sign. The driver of the mini-van testified that she initially stopped behind
    Mr. Heath, but then took her foot off the brake because she saw his brake
    lights go off. Although she did not touch the accelerator, her mini-van moved
    forward. Mr. Heath’s brake lights came back on and she was unable to stop
    before hitting him.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According
    to the driver of the mini-van, the mini-van was not damaged in the accident.
    Mr. Heath acknowledged that his car was not moved forward as the result of
    the impact from the rear.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>            ii) Mr. Heath’s claim for non-earner
      benefits</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Heath was unemployed but planning to attend school on the date of the accident.
    He started his action against Economical on May 30, 2002. He claimed that
    he was entitled to non-earner benefits under the 1996 SABS because he was
    completely unable to carry on a normal life as a result of injuries he sustained
    in the accident.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>            iii) The trial</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Heath’s claim against Economical was heard together with his action against
    the owner and the driver of the mini-van that hit his car. Although there
    was some dispute over the severity of the collision, the owner and driver
    of the mini-van admitted liability for the accident.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Heath was unrepresented at trial and did not call any expert witnesses to
    testify on his behalf. However, because the defence experts relied on Mr.
    Heath’s treatment records in preparing their reports, counsel for the owner
    and the driver of the mini-van filed a brief at trial containing those records. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Heath’s treatment records included a Health Status Report completed by Mr.
    Heath’s then family doctor, Dr. Courchene, on September 30, 1998 in relation
    to an application by Mr. Heath for income support under the Ontario Disability
    Support Program. The treatment records also included medical reports dated
    September 27, 1999 and November 3, 1999 from Dr. Garth Johnson, an orthopaedic
    surgeon who examined Mr. Heath on September 24, 1999 and subsequently reported
    on the outcome of various x-rays and tests.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Health Status Report indicated that Mr. Heath sustained a whiplash injury
    on March 10, 1998, that he suffers from degenerative disc disease and that
    his principal conditions were likely to continue for more than one year. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Health Status Report included an Activities of Daily Living Form. In that
    form, Dr. Courchene indicated that, six months post-accident, Mr. Heath was
    completely independent in most areas (mobility, situational responses, cognition,
    personal care, homemaking, communication, shopping, handling finances and
    community activities) but had modified independence (indicating a minimal
    impact on lifestyle) in a few areas: ability to participate in sustained
    activity connected with occupational activities; pain limitations; and use
    of transportation (limitations on driving distance because of neck pain).
    Mr. Heath acknowledged at trial that Dr. Courchene completed the Activities
    of Daily Living form based on information supplied by Mr. Heath.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Johnson indicated that Mr. Heath complained of neck pain, lower back and
    hip pain, and left foot pain. However, x-rays of Mr. Heath’s left foot and
    ankle were “completely normal” as were x-rays of his pelvis. X-rays of Mr.
    Heath’s cervical spine revealed “mild disc space narrowing at C5/6 and C6/7
    and some very small anterior osteophytes” while x-rays of his lumbar spine
    showed “slight loss of his lumbar lordosis”  and “disc space heights...intact.” Dr.
    Johnson’s November 3, 1999 report included the following comments:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I believe that these results indicate, as I felt,
    that he has some mild mechanical and postural neck pain based on some very
    minimal degenerative changes. There is no neurological component to his problem.
    There is no indication to consider further investigation or surgery. I would
    suggest symptomatic treatment only. Certainly, I see no indication to consider
    narcotic analgesics. My impression is that he is certainly physically capable
    of performing light duties. I cannot identify a specific limiting factor
    other than deconditioning which would limit his physical capability.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    contrast to these reports, Mr. Heath testified that he suffered numerous
    injuries as the result of the accident including: </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    cross-examination, Mr. Heath stated that he believed that his accident-related
    injuries began with a bump on the side of his neck that kept getting bigger
    and bigger, and that his neck pain had twisted his body sideways to the right
    and lifted his hip. He said his neck pain started to get worse in 1999, when
    it moved up into his head and down his legs and arms. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Heath also confirmed in cross-examination that his 1999 application for Ontario
    Disability Support Plan Benefits had been turned down. However, he testified
    that he began receiving such benefits about four months prior to trial. As
    the result of this evidence, a decision of the Social Benefits Tribunal dated
    May 26, 2005 and a medical report referred to in that decision were filed.
    The medical report was dated February 15, 2005 and was prepared by Dr. Keith
    Sequeira, a specialist in physical medicine and rehabilitation, who saw Mr.
    Heath at the request of Mr. Heath’s former counsel. Dr. Sequeira subsequently
    attended the trial for cross-examination by the defence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Sequeira’s report indicates that Mr. Heath
    “sustained a neck injury consistent with a whiplash associated disorder grade
    II” in the accident. In his report, Dr. Sequeira also states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This has developed into a chronic neck soft tissue
    pain syndrome that has been caused by this accident. He then began to experience
    various other regions of pain over the subsequent years. The other body areas
    of impairment likely have a multifactorial etiology that may in part relate
    to the progression of this neck pain into a chronic pain syndrome over the
    subsequent years and the resultant splinting and altered body mechanics caused
    by these neck impairments.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>                                                             ...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>From a physical standpoint, Mr. Heath is subjectively
    significantly disabled. He described his injuries as being quite intense
    and he is under the impression that he has sustained multiple fractures that
    have either been ignored or not addressed by medical personnel. I am not
    aware of any fractures that afflict Mr. Heath and opine that his injuries
    are of a soft tissue etiology. His impression of his own impairments is an
    important area that needs to be addressed, as his perception of his injuries
    is very relevant in that it impacts on his willingness or reluctance to participate
    in activity and his present state of deconditioning, impairments, and disabilities...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Pragmatically, Mr. Heath has profound vocational
    and functional limitations. He has essentially not worked since 1998 because
    of subjective and objective impairments. His current prognosis for vocational
    return is poor given this passage of time, his present skill set, experience,
    training, and aptitudes. In my opinion, he is substantively restricted in
    this regard and is highly unlikely to successfully achieve any sustainable
    vocational return at this point. In my opinion, Mr. Heath also requires permanent
    physical restrictions for future vocational, avocational and day to day endeavors
    which constitute:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>i) Limit sustained or repetitive
    neck postures;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>ii) Avoid repetitive, moderate
    or heavy lifting and carrying;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>iii) Limit work at or above
    shoulder height.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>These restrictions need
    to be in place permanently for vocational, avocational, and day to day roles
    for Mr. Heath.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his trial evidence, Dr. Sequeira indicated that although it was possible
    Mr. Heath could have sustained a spinal wedge fracture referred to in a March
    30, 1999 x-ray report in a low speed collision, it was not likely.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition to filing various medical reports and playing videotaped surveillance
    of Mr. Heath during cross-examination, the defence called the driver of the
    mini-van and Dr. A.B. Deathe as witnesses. Dr. Deathe is a specialist in
    physical medicine and rehabilitation. He conducted a defence medical on December
    1, 2004 and provided medical reports dated December 28, 2004 and May 18,
    2005.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Deathe testified that it was improbable that Mr. Heath had sustained a wedge
    fracture in the accident. He said if there was in fact a wedge fracture,
    it was a minor fracture that would generally heal in three to six months
    with minimal, if any consequences. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Deathe disagreed with Dr. Sequeira's diagnosis of chronic, diffuse, soft
    tissue pain syndrome attributable to the accident. In his May 18, 2005 report,
    he said “[t]hat may be an apt description of this man's current physical
    complaints but I wouldn't attribute that chronic diffuse soft tissue pain
    syndrome to the [accident].” Rather, in his view, Mr. Heath sustained “a
    mild soft tissue cervical strain which within weeks or months was basically
    back to normal range of motion.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    videotaped surveillance of Mr. Heath was taken on December 1 and December
    9, 2004 as well as November 7, 2005. Mr. Heath acknowledged that the surveillance
    taken on December 9, 2004 showed him walking, either pulling or pushing a
    shopping cart, over a period of two hours and 15 minutes, without using a
    cane.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>IV. The Trial Judges’ Reasons</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge concluded that Mr. Heath suffered a moderate flexion extension
    injury to his cervical spine in the accident. However, relying in large part
    on the evidence of Dr. Sequeira, the trial judge concluded that although
    moderate, Mr. Heath’s injury seriously affected his ability to function and
    earn a living for two reasons. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    Mr. Heath experienced degenerative changes to his neck prior to the accident
    and this vulnerability aggravated the effects of his injury. Second, because
    of Mr. Heath’s personality and coping skills, he had an unusual reaction
    to the injury and developed permanent chronic pain over a period of several
    years. In the result, the trial judge concluded that Mr. Heath will be “partially
    if not permanently disabled for his working life.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge awarded damages in the tort action as follows:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>            Non pecuniary
    general damages                                                                  $125,000</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>            Special damages
    for loss of income-8 years at $5,000 per year              $  40,000</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>            Pecuniary general
    damages (future loss of income)                                 $220,000</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Concerning
    Mr. Heath’s claim against Economical for non-earner benefits, the trial judge
    found that Mr. Heath is entitled to a benefit “on the basis of his disability
    and the evidence of Dr. Sequeira.” The entirety of the trial judge's reasons
    concerning this issue are as follows:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><a name="OLE_LINK2"></a><a
name="OLE_LINK1">I am satisfied that the plaintiff has met the onus of establishing
      that his injuries and his impairment from chronic pain have continuously
      prevented him from engaging in substantially all of the activities in which
      he ordinarily engaged before the accident.</a></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>He is a lonely man, who
    has few friends and contacts, whose activities are substantially impaired
    and I accept the fact that he must pace himself as a result of his continued,
    constant and chronic pain. I accept the fact that part of the problem is
    that he has de-conditioned. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>V. Analysis</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>i) Did the trial judge
      apply the wrong test for determining whether Mr. Heath is entitled to a
      non-earner benefit? </b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    12(1) of the 1996 SABS establishes the criteria for entitlement to a non-earner
    benefit. There are three critical ingredients: i) an insured must suffer
    an impairment as the result of an accident; ii) the insured must suffer a
    complete inability to carry on a normal life as a result of and within 104
    weeks after the accident; and iii) the insured must not qualify for an income
    replacement benefit:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>12. (1) <u>The insurer shall
      pay an insured person</u> who sustains an impairment as a result of an
      accident <u>a non-earner benefit if</u> the insured meets any of the following
      qualifications:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>1. <u>The insured person
      suffers a complete inability to carry on a normal life as a result of and
      within 104 weeks after the accident</u> and does not qualify for an income
      replacement benefit. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    2(4) of the 1996 SABS describes the meaning of
    “a complete inability to carry on a normal life.” Essentially, it requires
    that the person suffer from an impairment as a result of the accident that
    “continuously prevents the person from engaging in substantially all the
    activities in which the person ordinarily engaged before the accident”:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>2. (4) For the purposes
    of this Regulation, a person suffers a complete inability to carry on a normal
    life as a result of an accident if, and only if, as a result of the accident, <u>the
    person sustains an impairment that continuously prevents the person from
    engaging in substantially all of the activities in which the person ordinarily
    engaged before the accident</u>. [Emphasis added.]<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge dealt with Mr. Heath’s claim for a non-earner benefit beginning
    at paragraph 277 of his reasons. He set out the test for qualifying for a
    non-earner benefit at paragraphs 278 and 279 as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Under the regulations, the plaintiff is entitled
    to non-worker benefits for the first 156 weeks following his accident provided
    that he suffers ‘a partial inability to carry on a normal life.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><u>That test changes after
      156 weeks</u> to the following:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>The plaintiff <u>must have
      sustained “a complete inability to engage in substantially all of the activities
      in which he or she would ordinarily engage</u>.” [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
    on a review of s. 12 and s. 2(4) of the 1996 SABS, it is apparent that the
    trial judge did not set out the correct test for determining whether Mr.
    Heath is entitled to a non-earner benefit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    relation to accidents that happened on or after November 1, 1996, the test
    for qualifying for a non-earner benefit is more stringent than the test articulated
    by the trial judge. Rather than permitting benefits where a person suffers
    a <u>partial</u> inability to carry on a normal life <u>within three years</u> after
    the accident, s. 12(1) of the 1996 SABS stipulates that to qualify for a
    benefit a person must suffer a <u>complete</u> inability to carry on a normal
    life <u>within two years</u> of the accident. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    in contrast to the test the trial judge said applies after three years, under
    s. 2(4) of the 1996 SABS, the question of whether a person has suffered a
    complete inability to carry on a normal life turns on whether the person
    has sustained “an impairment that <u>continuously</u> prevents the person
    from engaging in <u>substantially all of the activities in which the person
    ordinarily engaged before the accident</u> (emphasis added).” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rather
    than focussing on whether the claimant sustained
    “a complete inability to engage in substantially all of the <u>activities
    in which he or she would ordinarily engage</u> [emphasis added]” as stated
    by the trial judge, the test set out in s. 2(4) focuses on “<u>the activities
    in which the person ordinarily engaged before the accident</u> (emphasis
    added).”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    paragraphs 282 and 283 of his reasons, the trial judge framed the test in
    a different way that more closely approximates the test set out in the 1996
    SABS. He said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The thrust of the defence evidence in this case
    is that the evidence of Dr. Courchene and Dr. Johnson do not substantiate
    a complete inability to carry on a normal life and further, after 156 weeks,
    a complete inability to engage in substantially all of the activities that
    he would normally engage in. These views were expressed by the experts in
    1998 and 1999.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>I have made it clear, that
    I find that the plaintiff did suffer a significant injury that has affected
    his lifestyle in a substantial way and the views of the experts are simply
    out of date based upon developments since then.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless,
    I reject any suggestion that these paragraphs of the trial judge’s reasons
    somehow rehabilitate his misstatement of the test at paragraphs 278 and 279.
    For one thing, the reference in paragraph 282 to 156 weeks is plainly wrong;
    the correct time frame is 104 weeks. Moreover, the trial judge’s reference
    to “a complete inability to engage in substantially all of the activities
    that he would normally engage in” is inaccurate. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More
    importantly, in contrast to paragraph 282 in which the trial judge was summarizing
    the position of the defence, at paragraph 278 the trial judge was setting
    out the applicable test for the purposes of his judgment. Accordingly, in
    my opinion, it is the test set out at paragraph 278 of his reasons that the
    trial judge actually applied, which is not the correct test.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    I note that at paragraph 280 of his reasons, the trial judge expressed a
    general conclusion that appears to meet the correct test under s. 12(1) of
    the 1996 SABS. He said:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>I am satisfied that the
    plaintiff has met the onus of establishing that his injuries and his impairment
    from chronic pain have continuously prevented him from engaging in substantially
    all of the activities in which he ordinarily engaged before the accident.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite
    this statement, I am satisfied that the trial judge’s error in stating the
    test for qualifying for non-earner benefits taints his conclusion that Mr.
    Heath is entitled to such benefits. I say that for three reasons. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    it is clear that the trial judge concluded that it is Mr. Heath’s chronic
    pain that gives rise to his ongoing disability and that this condition developed
    over time. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    expressing his conclusion at paragraph 280 that Mr. Heath was entitled to
    benefits the trial judge said, “his injuries and <u>his impairment from chronic
    pain</u> have continuously prevented him from engaging in substantially all
    of the activities in which he ordinarily engaged before the accident (emphasis
    added).” At paragraph 210 of his reasons, the trial judge explicitly stated, “<u>over
    the past several years</u> the plaintiff has developed chronic pain (emphasis
    added).” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the trial judge rejected the defence position that the evidence of Dr. Courchene
    and Dr. Johnson do not substantiate a complete inability to carry on a normal
    life by saying that the views of those doctors “are simply out of date based
    on developments since then.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s explanation of his reason for not relying on this evidence
    implies that Mr. Heath’s disability arose subsequent to these reports. Notably,
    Dr. Johnson’s report relates to an examination that occurred a little more
    than a year and a half after the accident well within two years of the accident
    as required by statute.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    the trial judge did not make any finding concerning when Mr. Heath’s disability
    arose. To repeat, to qualify for a non-earner benefit, s. 12(1) of the 1996
    SABS requires that the disability arise within two years after the accident.
    Dr. Johnson’s report did not support a finding of disability. His report
    was conducted about a year and a half after the accident. The trial judge
    rejected his report and instead relied on Dr. Sequeira’s report because Dr.
    Johnson’s conclusions were out of date. The trial judge found that Mr. Heath’s
    disability arose from chronic pain that developed over time. In these circumstances,
    a finding concerning precisely when Mr. Heath’s disability arose was essential
    to justify allowing his claim for benefits. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the circumstances, I accept Economical’s submission that the trial judge
    applied the wrong test for determining whether Mr. Heath is entitled to a
    non-earner benefit under the 1996 SABS and that this error taints the trial
    judge’s conclusion that Mr. Heath is entitled to a benefit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>2. Was there evidence
      at trial capable of supporting Mr. Heath’s claim for a non-earner benefit?</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>a) The test for non-earner
      benefits</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    s. 12 and s. 2(4) of the 1996 SABS have not been considered extensively by
    the courts, they have been considered in a number of arbitration decisions.
    Based on my review of various decisions, as well as a consideration of the
    language and purpose of the 1996 SABS, and a review of the predecessor provisions,
    I would adopt the following general principles as being part of a proper
    approach to the application of these sections:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Wingdings;
'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Generally
    speaking, the starting point for the analysis of whether a claimant suffers
    from a complete inability to carry on a normal life will be to compare the
    claimant’s activities and life circumstances before the accident to his or
    her activities and life circumstances after the accident.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[3]</span></span></span></a> This follows from the language of the section
    as well as a review of the predecessor provisions. That said, there may be
    some circumstances in which a comparison, or at least a detailed comparison,
    of the claimant’s pre-accident and post-accident activities and circumstances
    is unnecessary, having regard to the nature of the claimant’s post-accident
    condition.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Wingdings;
'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Consideration
    of a claimant’s activities and life circumstances prior to the accident requires
    more than taking a snap-shot of a claimant’s life in the time frame immediately
    preceding the accident. It involves an assessment of the appellant’s activities
    and circumstances over a reasonable period prior to the accident, the duration
    of which will depend on the facts of the case.<a href="#_ftn4"
name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Wingdings;
'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    order to determine whether the claimant’s ability to continue engaging in “substantially
    all” of his or her pre-accident activities has been affected to the required
    degree, all of the pre-accident activities in which the claimant ordinarily
    engaged should be considered. However, in deciding whether the necessary
    threshold has been satisfied, greater weight may be assigned to those activities
    which the claimant identifies as being important to his/her pre-accident
    life.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='line-height:200%'><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman";"Times New Roman";'>[5]</span></span></span></span></a> </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>Although this approach differs somewhat from the approach
    taken in <i>Walker v. Ritchie</i>, 2003 CanLII 17106 (Ont. S.C.), in which
    the trial judge focused on those activities that were “most important” to
    the claimant before the accident, in my opinion, it better reflects the high
    threshold created by the language of the section and at the same time allows
    a claimant-focussed inquiry. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Wingdings;
'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is not sufficient for a claimant to demonstrate that there were changes in
    his or her post-accident life.  Rather, it is incumbent on a claimant to
    establish that those changes amounted to him or her being continuously prevented
    from engaging in substantially all of his pre-accident activities. The phrase “continuously
    prevents” means that a claimant must prove “disability or incapacity of the
    requisite nature, extent or degree which is and remains uninterrupted.”<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6"

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Wingdings;
'>§<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    phrase “engaging in” should be interpreted from a qualitative perspective
    and as meaning more than isolated post-accident attempts to perform activities
    that a claimant was able to perform before the accident.  The activity must
    be viewed as a whole, and a claimant who merely goes through the motions
    cannot be said to be “engaging in” an activity.<a href="#_ftn7"

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[7]</span></span></span></a> Moreover, the manner in which an activity is performed
    and the quality of performance post-accident must also be considered.  If
    the degree to which a claimant can perform an activity is sufficiently restricted,
    it cannot be said that he or she is truly “engaging in” the activity.<a href="#_ftn8"

    cases where pain is a primary factor that allegedly prevents the insured
    from engaging in his or her former activities, the question is not whether
    the insured can physically do these activities, but whether the degree of
    pain experienced, either at the time, or subsequent to the activity, is such
    that the individual is practically prevented from engaging in those activities.<a href="#_ftn9"

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    difficulty with both the trial judge’s approach in this case and the evidence
    led by Mr. Heath is that they focus on Mr. Heath’s condition and activities
    during a time frame relatively proximate to the trial with little or no consideration
    of either his pre-accident condition and activities, or his condition and
    activities during the two-year post-accident period in which a claimant must
    qualify for a non-earner benefit. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Heath provided virtually no evidence concerning his pre-accident activities
    or concerning the extent to which he was prevented from engaging in those
    activities within the two-year period following the accident. In cross-examination
    at trial, Mr. Heath agreed that he had said on discovery that he was prevented
    from working, bowling and skiing as the result of the accident. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    Mr. Heath also confirmed that that he was on social assistance at the time
    of the accident; that he had not worked steadily for a number of years prior
    to the accident; and that he did not work at all in the one-year period preceding
    the accident. Mr. Heath gave no evidence that he was looking for work prior
    to the accident. Moreover, he provided no details about the extent of his
    bowling and skiing activities prior to the accident, nor any details about
    how he otherwise passed his time. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    for his post-accident activities, Mr. Heath confirmed that he continued to
    live in an apartment after the accident; that he was independent as to self-care;
    that he was able to obtain his own groceries and make his own meals and that
    he did not experience driving anxiety. Although Mr. Heath said he did not
    usually do housework, he also said there is not much housework to be done.</p>

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">
    Algonquin
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    College confirming that he was accepted into a 64-week course in robotics
    for the summer term of 1998. He testified that he did not attend this program
    because he was in too much pain and because he was busy trying to find a
    doctor. However, he did not produce any medical evidence at trial confirming
    he was unable to attend the robotics program because of pain. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    fact, contrary to Mr. Heath’s evidence, the reports from Dr. Courchene and
    Dr. Johnson suggest that Mr. Heath was physically capable of attending the
    robotics program. Significantly, although the trial judge commented at one
    point in his reasons that “these doctors did not know and understand the
    full details of the plaintiff’s degenerative and weathered cervical spine”,
    the reason the trial judge gave for not relying on their evidence was that
    their reports were out of date. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Importantly,
    there was no evidence at trial that Mr. Heath was actually in school or engaging
    in any similar form of activity prior to the accident. Although Mr. Heath
    testified that he passed an entrance examination for the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Algonquin
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    College robotics program, there was also evidence that he previously withdrew
    from an electronics program in the past with no courses completed, and that
    he received failing marks in a college program he attended for some period
    in 1993, but did not complete. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    as already noted, the evidence at trial indicated that Mr. Heath had not
    worked steadily for a number of years prior to the accident, that he had
    not worked at all in the one-year period prior to the accident, and that
    he was on social assistance at the time of the accident. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the result of this evidence, the matter of Mr. Heath’s pre-accident capacity
    to attend and complete a college program or to work full-time was far from
    clear. What is clear is that there was no evidence at trial indicating he
    was going to school or engaged in any form of similar activity in the period
    leading up to the accident.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the trial judge preferred Dr. Sequeira’s evidence to the evidence of Dr.
    Deathe concerning the level of Mr. Heath’s disability and how it was caused,
    Dr. Sequeira did not see Mr. Heath until February 15, 2005, almost seven
    years after the accident. Significantly, Dr. Sequeira did not provide an
    opinion concerning whether Mr. Heath suffered a complete inability to carry
    on a normal life within 104 weeks after the accident. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, there is no indication that Dr. Sequeira was in a position to give
    such an opinion. It was apparent from his evidence that he did not have an
    accurate understanding of Mr. Heath’s pre-accident work history. Further,
    there is no indication in his report or in his evidence that he had a clear
    understanding of Mr. Heath’s pre-accident activities. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
    on my review of the record, it appears that there was some evidence that
    may have permitted a trier of fact to draw an inference that the disability
    Dr. Sequeira described developed within 104 weeks of the accident. Mr. Heath
    testified that his neck pain started to get worse in 1999, when it moved
    up into his head and down his legs and arms.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless,
    on the facts of this case, proving the disability described by Dr. Sequeira
    was not sufficient to satisfy the requirements of s. 12(2) of the 1996 SABS.
    Rather, it was also necessary that Mr. Heath establish on a balance of probabilities
    that his disability prevented him from engaging in substantially all of the
    activities in which he engaged before the accident. Mr. Heath failed to establish
    a change to his activities after the accident. In my view, in the circumstances
    of this case, the dearth of evidence relating to Mr. Heath’s pre-accident
    activities precludes a finding that Mr. Heath qualifies for non-earner benefits. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I would allow the appeal, set aside the trial judge’s order and dismiss the
    action against Economical. I would order costs of the appeal to the appellant
    in the amount of $4,000 inclusive of G.S.T. and disbursements plus costs
    of the trial in the amount of $7,500 inclusive of G.S.T.  and disbursements.</p>
