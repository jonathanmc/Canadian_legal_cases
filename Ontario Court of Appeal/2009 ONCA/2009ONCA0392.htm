  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant appeals both his conviction for second degree murder and that part
    of his sentence that fixed his parole eligibility at 12 years from the date
    of his arrest.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant stabbed Michael Thornhill on July 15, 2004.  The victim died almost
    immediately.  At trial, the appellant was prepared to plead guilty to manslaughter.  The
    Crown rejected this offer.  The trial proceeded and the appellant was convicted
    of second degree murder.  He was sentenced to life imprisonment with no eligibility
    to apply for parole for 12 years from the date of his arrest.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>A.        <u>Conviction Appeal</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    support of the appellant’s conviction appeal, duty counsel submits that the
    trial judge erred in three ways in his charge to the jury: first, in his
    instruction on intoxication; second, in his direction on <i>R. v. W. (D.)</i>,
    [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742; and, third, by instructing the jury on the authority
    of <i>R. v. Cooper</i>, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 146, with respect to the temporal
    relationship between the wrongful act and the appellant’s intent to cause
    the wrongful act.  We would not give effect to these submissions for the
    following reasons.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(1) <u>Intoxication instruction</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his initial instruction on intoxication, the trial judge told the jury:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If you believe, or have a reasonable doubt, that
    the consumption of alcohol and/or drugs affected [the appellant’s] ability
    to foresee the natural and probable consequences of his actions, then you
    must not rely upon the common sense inference that a sane and sober person
    intends the natural and probable consequences of his actions when you decide
    whether [the appellant] had the intent to kill Michael Thornhill.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Defence
    counsel at trial objected to this instruction, arguing that if on the evidence
    of intoxication the jury formed a reasonable doubt as to whether the appellant
    was able to foresee the natural consequences of his conduct, then resort
    to the common sense presumption was impermissible since the jury’s doubt
    would necessitate a verdict of acquittal.  Based on this objection, the trial
    judge acceded to the defence request that he recharge the jury on this issue.  In
    his recharge, the trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If, after consideration of all of the evidence,
    you are left with a reasonable doubt as to whether or not it is appropriate
    to draw the inference that [the appellant] intended the natural consequences
    of his actions, then you must not draw that inference.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    this court, duty counsel not only renews the claim asserted by defence counsel
    at trial that the original intoxication instruction was flawed, but also
    submits that the recharge failed to correct the deficiency identified in
    the original instruction.  In our view, this argument fails.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defence theory at trial was that the appellant lacked the requisite intent
    for murder since he was intoxicated at the time of the fatal attack on the
    victim.  He therefore sought to plead guilty to manslaughter.  However, the
    Crown refused to accept that plea.  In his charge to the jury, the trial
    judge reviewed the evidence that supported the appellant’s defence of intoxication.  Then,
    when instructing the jury on intoxication, he specifically told the jury
    that the appellant’s actual intent was the central issue for its determination.  The
    trial judge put it this way:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Please remember that the question for you to decide
    is, what did Rian Dix actually intend?  You are not entitled to rely upon
    the common sense inference if, after consideration of all of the evidence,
    you are left with a reasonable doubt whether the intent to kill Michael Thornhill
    has been proven by the Crown beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge later added:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is important that you understand that evidence
    of intoxication from alcohol and/or drugs may raise a reasonable doubt as
    to whether Rian Dix actually foresaw the consequences of his conduct.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    instructions properly focused the jury’s attention on the critical issue
    at trial, namely, the appellant’s actual intent at the time of the incident
    in question.  In light of these instructions, it cannot be said that the
    jury was in any doubt either about its task or about the evidence bearing
    on the appellant’s asserted intoxication defence.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(2) <u>The <i>W. (D.) </i>instruction</u><i></i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge did not provide a <i>W.(D.)</i> instruction in his initial charge
    to the jury.  Defence counsel objected, however, to the absence of such an
    instruction, and Crown counsel agreed that one was appropriate.  Accordingly,
    the trial judge recharged the jury and provided the standard <i>W.(D.)</i> instruction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant contends that the <i>W.(D.) </i>instruction given in the recharge
    was deficient because the trial judge did not link it to the issue of intoxication.  We
    disagree.  In his <i>W. (D.)</i> instruction, the trial judge specifically
    referred the jury to the appellant’s statement to the police and told the
    jury that it could believe “all of it, some of it, or none of it.”  The trial
    judge had already reviewed in great detail in his charge to the jury the
    appellant’s statement to the police, including the potentially exculpatory
    comments about how he was drunk and not thinking straight when he stabbed
    the victim.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(3) <u>The <i>Cooper</i> instruction</u></span><a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span lang=EN-US style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></span></a></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Cooper</i> at
    p. 157, the Supreme Court of Canada referred to “the classic rule that at
    some point the <i>actus
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    reus</i> and the <i>mens rea</i> or intent must coincide.”  In light of this
    classic rule, the appellant contends that the trial judge erred in giving
    the jury the following instruction:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In considering the evidence you should know that
    the Crown does not have to prove this essential element of intent continued
    throughout the entire unlawful act that caused Michael Thornhill’s death.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    disagree.  In <i>Cooper</i> at p. 157, the court stated that
    “it is not always necessary, however, for the guilty act and the intent to
    be completely concurrent.”  Moreover, on the facts in this case, there was
    really no issue about the relationship between the <i>actus
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    reus</i> and the <i>mens rea</i>.  Those facts are aptly captured in the
    following example set out in <i>Cooper</i> at pp. 157 – 158:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>For example, if the accused … stabbed the victim
    in the chest with death ensuing a few minutes after the … stabbing, then
    it would be relatively easy to infer that the requisite intent or <i>mens
    rea</i> coincided with the wrongful act (<i>actus reus)</i> of … stabbing.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    although the trial judge’s charge to the jury on this point can probably
    be characterized as superfluous, it was not incorrect.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>B.        <u>Sentence Appeal</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the sentence hearing, both the Crown and the defence agreed that the appropriate
    range for the period of parole ineligibility was 10
    – 12 years.  The Crown sought 12 years; the defence sought 10 years.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge imposed a period of parole ineligibility of 12 years.  In doing
    so, he carefully considered the circumstances relating to both the offence
    and the offender.  He also reviewed two
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario decisions upholding parole ineligibility periods of 12 years in circumstances
    very similar to those in this case: see <i>R. v. McBride</i>, [2005] O.J.
    No. 1043 (Sup.
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ct.), and <i>R. v. Arroyo</i>, [2005] O.J. No. 1092 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  We do not see any error in his analysis and, in our view, a period of
    parole ineligibility of 12 years is not unfit in the circumstances of this
    case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
