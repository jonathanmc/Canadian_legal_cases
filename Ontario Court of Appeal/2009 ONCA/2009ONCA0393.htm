    this withdrawal, class proceedings were commenced in most Canadian provinces
    on behalf of Vioxx users.  The

    s.&nbsp;30(2) of the <i>Class Proceedings Act, 1992</i>, S.O. 1992, c.6 (the “CPA”).  That
    section provides that a party may appeal to the

    Divisional Court from an order certifying a class proceeding, with leave

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    November 24, 2008, Bellamy J., sitting as a judge of the Superior Court of
    Justice, denied the moving parties’ motion for leave to appeal to the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court.  In her reasons for denying the leave, Bellamy J. held
    that “[i]n liberally construing class proceedings legislation,” Cullity J.
    had “applied existing principles of law to the facts of the case facing him,
    facts which, in essence, were identical or similar to those facing Klebuc,
    C.J.S. who had no difficulty certifying the class action in Saskatchewan”:
    para.&nbsp;25.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    March 30, 2009, the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal quashed the order certifying
    the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Saskatchewan action.  The court concluded that “the learned certification
    judge erred in finding that the respondents had established an identifiable
    class, in defining common issues, and in establishing that a class action
    would be the preferable procedure within the meaning of s. 6 of <i>The</i> <i>Class
    Actions Act</i>”: <i>Merck Frosst Canada Ltd. v. Wuttunee</i>, 2009 SKCA
    43, at para. 167.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Positions of the Parties</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    moving parties submit that, as a result of the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal’s
    decision, they are facing conflicting decisions as to whether a class action
    involving Vioxx users is a certifiable proceeding that should be allowed
    to proceed.  They argue that this fact would have been an important consideration
    in determining whether the leave ought to have been granted.  In their view,
    Bellamy J. would have granted the leave had the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal
    decision been rendered prior to her decision.  In essence, the moving parties
    argue that, in the context of class action litigation involving overlapping
    national classes, it is simply unfair to have what they submit are conflicting
    decisions involving the same product, substantially the same claims, and
    substantially the same plaintiffs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    time period for filing a notice of motion for leave to appeal Bellamy J.’s
    order expired some four months ago.  On this motion, the moving parties are
    seeking an extension of time so that they may now seek leave to appeal to
    this court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents submit that this motion should fail on the basis that the appeal
    is without merit and that this case does not constitute an exception to the
    general principle that no appeal lies from a decision refusing leave to appeal.  The
    respondents further argue that, in any event, any review of Bellamy J.’s
    order should be brought before the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court with leave, pursuant to s. 19(1)(b) of the CJA. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Test for Granting an Extension of Time</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    considering whether to exercise its discretion to extend the time for the
    filing of a notice of appeal, a court generally considers the following factors:</p>
  <p>1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>whether
    the appellant formed an intention to appeal within the relevant period;</p>
  <p>2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the

  <p>4)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    merits of the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>The court also considers whether the justice of the
    case requires the granting of the extension: see <i>Kefeli v. Centennial
    College of Applied Arts &amp; Technology</i> (2002), 23 C.P.C. (5<sup>th</sup>)
    35 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), at para. 14, and <i>Rizzi v. Mavros</i> (2007), 85 O.R. (3d) 401 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), at para. 16.</p>
  <h3><i><span
style='font-weight:normal'>Intention to appeal, delay, and prejudice to the respondent</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the present case, the moving parties have adequately explained both the delay
    and the reason why they only developed the intention to appeal after the
    appeal period had expired.  Once the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal rendered
    its decision, the moving parties promptly brought the present motion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, there is little prejudice flowing from the delay.  The claim was
    issued in October 2004 and the delay in appealing the decision of Bellamy
    J. is of only four months.  There has been no decision on the merits of the
    action and, further, there is a motion for leave to appeal pending in this
    court on the related matter of whether a stay of the proceedings ought to
    have been granted by Cullity J.  Granting the extension of time in this instance
    will not cause any significant delay in the progress of the action.</p>
  <h3><i><span style='font-weight:normal'>Merits of the appeal</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Principally,
    the respondents oppose the extension of time on the basis that the appeal
    lacks merit.  In their view, the motion should fail on this ground alone.  They
    make three submissions in that regard. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the respondents maintain that no appeal lies from a decision refusing leave
    to appeal, except in the rare circumstance where the judge refusing leave
    has mistakenly declined jurisdiction.  Even if they were to accept that this
    court intended to broaden this exception by stating in <i>Hillmond Investments
    Ltd. v. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce</i> (1996), 29 O.R. (3d) 612,
    at para. 35, that “there must be an avenue of redress in exceptional cases” where
    leave to appeal has been refused, the respondents submit that the facts of
    this case do not constitute such an “exceptional” case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    the respondents submit that the limited appellate review referred to in <i>Hillmond</i> is
    properly exercised by the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court pursuant to s. 19(1)(b) of the CJA. In their view, neither
    the certification order nor the refusal to grant leave to appeal that order
    finally disposed of the moving parties’ substantive rights.  The respondents
    submit, therefore, that the moving parties are in the wrong court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    the respondents maintain that the extension of time ought not to be granted
    because the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal’s decision has little or no bearing
    on Bellamy J.’s decision.  Although the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Saskatchewan and
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario class actions involve the same product they are, in the respondents’ view,
    framed differently.  It is the way that the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Saskatchewan action was pleaded that led to the certification order being
    quashed by the Court of Appeal.  In the respondents’
    view, therefore, nothing has changed as a result of the Saskatchewan Court
    of Appeal’s decision and the moving parties’ proposed appeal has no merit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dealing
    with the respondents’ third point, it must be kept in mind that the merits
    that I need to consider in this matter are the merits of the appeal from
    Bellamy J.’s decision on the leave to appeal motion.  A significant factor
    on a leave to appeal motion is, as provided in rule 62.02(4)(a), whether “there
    is a conflicting decision by another judge or court in Ontario or elsewhere
    on the matter involved in the proposed appeal.” The reasons of both Cullity
    J. and Bellamy J. refer to the similarity between the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Saskatchewan and
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario actions.  It may well be that, as submitted by the moving parties,
    Bellamy J. would have viewed the matter differently had the decision of the
    Saskatchewan Court of Appeal quashing the certification order issued prior
    to her rendering her decision.  I am not, therefore, prepared to say that
    the proposed appeal is without merit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    more difficult issue is the question of procedure.  There is considerable
    confusion as to whether a refusal to grant leave to appeal can be appealed
    and, if so, what court to apply to and what procedure to follow. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    are two major steps in resolving this issue.  The first step is for the moving
    party to decide whether the refusal to grant leave was an interlocutory or
    final order.  Only then can the proper court and procedure be determined.
    Once in the proper forum, the moving party must then show that the case fits
    within the exception to the general rule that a refusal to grant leave to
    appeal cannot be appealed: see <i>Hillmond, Denison Mines Ltd. v. Ontario
    Hydro </i>(2001), 56 O.R. (3d) 181 (C.A.)<i>, </i>and <i>Lombard Canada Co.
    v. Axa Assurance Inc.</i> (2007), 228 O.A.C. 32 (C.A.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Many
    refusals of leave to appeal motions are clearly interlocutory.  For example
    a refusal of a leave motion brought pursuant to s. 19(1)(b) of the CJA is
    clearly interlocutory as it seeks to review an order that itself was interlocutory.  In
    such a case, the appropriate route is to seek leave to appeal from the refusal
    to the Divisional Court, again pursuant to s. 19(1)(b) of the CJA: see <i>Kohar
    v. Dufferin-Peel Catholic District School Board</i>, [1999] O.J. No. 3644
    (Div. Ct.). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    not every refusal of leave to appeal to the
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court is necessarily an interlocutory order. Where, as in this
    case, a statute provides a right of appeal to the Divisional Court with leave
    of the Superior Court of Justice, the question of whether the refusal to
    grant leave is an interlocutory or final order will depend on whether the
    refusal meets the definition of a final order articulated by this court in <i>Hendrickson
    v. Kallio</i>, [1932] O.R. 675. For example, this court in <i>Denison</i> <i>Mines</i> found
    that the refusal to grant leave to appeal pursuant to s. 45 of the <i>Arbitration
    Act, 1991</i>, S.O. 1991, c. 17, was a final order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    considering the appropriate appeal route in this case, it must be recalled
    that Bellamy J. was sitting as a Superior Court judge and not as a single
    judge of the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court: see s. 30(2) of the CPA and rule 62.02(1.1).  The rules
    governing the procedure for appeal are, therefore, the rules that generally
    apply to an appeal from an order of a Superior Court judge.  Where the order
    is final, the appeal is to the Court of Appeal pursuant to s. 6(1)(b) of
    the CJA and no leave is required.  Where the order is interlocutory, the
    appeal is governed by s. 19(1)(b) of the CJA and goes to the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court with leave.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applying
    these principles to the present case, there is no scenario pursuant to which
    leave to appeal to this court would be required.  Therefore, I see no basis
    for granting an extension of time for filing a notice of motion for leave
    to appeal to this court.  If the moving parties consider that Bellamy J.’s
    order is final, then the appeal, if any, is to this court as of right.  If
    they consider the order to be interlocutory, then the appeal, if any, lies
    to the
    <st1:Street

    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court with leave.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents have argued that I should find that the appeal is without merit
    because Bellamy J.’s order is interlocutory. In the circumstances, I consider
    that this issue should properly be decided by a panel of this court, should
    the moving parties choose to pursue the appeal by way of s. 6(1)(b) of the
    CJA.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    question of whether this case falls within an exception to the general rule
    that a refusal of leave to appeal cannot be appealed will be resolved by
    the court to which the appeal is taken.  Deciding the appropriate principles
    and then applying these principles to the case are matters properly addressed
    at the hearing of the appeal or on a motion to quash.  Different considerations
    may well apply depending on the nature of the case and whether the order
    is final or interlocutory.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Conclusion</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Should
    the moving parties conclude that the order is final and that their appeal
    lies to this court, I grant an extension of the time for filing the notice
    of appeal to May 21, 2009.  If this appeal route is taken by the moving parties,
    the respondents are at liberty to bring a motion seeking to quash the appeal
    should they be of the view that Bellamy J.’s order is not a final order.  As
    well, they are free to take the position, on appeal or in a motion to quash,
    that the order of Bellamy J. is not appealable pursuant to the principles
    outlined in <i>Hillmond</i> and <i>Denison Mines</i>. I should not, therefore,
    be taken to have decided these issues.  If they are raised, they will be
    dealt with by a panel of this court.</p>
