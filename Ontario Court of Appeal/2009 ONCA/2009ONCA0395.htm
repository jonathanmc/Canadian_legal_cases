  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    the release of this Court’s decision on February 4, 2009, we have received
    and reviewed counsel’s submissions as to costs.  This is our endorsement
    in that regard.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Serra, the appellant, was substantially successful on the appeal and – as
    a result – at trial.  Mr. Epstein seeks to have us fix costs for both the
    trial and the appeal.  Mr. Morton has not opposed that suggestion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sadly,
    Mr. Serra has died since the release of our decision.  Neither counsel has
    submitted that this fact should alter our disposition as to costs, however.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant seeks costs of $412,034 in total.  This amount is comprised of
    a sum of $377,343 for fees and disbursements plus GST at trial and the sum
    of $34,691 for fees, disbursements and GST on appeal – all on a partial indemnity
    basis.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial lasted nine days, the appeal one.  The appellant argues that the trial
    preparation and the trial itself were unduly prolonged by the respondent’s
    irrational belief that his company was worth $65 million and by her far-reaching
    trust and accounting claims.  The trial judge found no evidence that the
    appellant was hiding assets and dismissed the respondent’s trust claims (which
    she had sought to withdraw on the eve of trial).  The bulk of the trial was
    devoted to (a) the equalization of net family property issue – on which the
    appellant was ultimately substantially successful – and (b) the trust claim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant made numerous offers to settle throughout the pre-trial period.  The
    respondent made none.  As Justice R.J. Spence noted in <i>Husein v. Chatoor</i> (2006),
    24 R.F.L. (6<sup>th</sup>) 274 (Ont. Ct. J.), at para. 30:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[P]arties have an obligation to begin to assess
    their respective cases at the outset of the litigation – even before the
    litigation commences – and to make all reasonable efforts to settle. Legal
    fees can create enormous financial burdens for litigants and <i>it ehoves
    neither party simply to sit back and to roll the dice while those fees continue
    to mount</i>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Morton accepts “the timelines and underlying facts as set out” in the appellant’s
    materials and that the time docketed was in fact spent.  He argues that the
    respondent’s conduct was not unreasonable or excessive, however, and that
    the results of both the trial and the appeal were mixed. He makes no submissions
    as to quantum either at trial or on appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Modern
    costs rules are designed to foster three fundamental purposes: (1) to partially
    indemnify successful litigants for the cost of litigation; (2) to encourage
    settlement; and (3) to discourage and sanction inappropriate behaviour by
    litigants: <i>Fong v. Chan </i>(1999), 46 O.R. (3d) 330, at para. 22.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rule
    24(11) of the <i>Family Law Rules</i>, O. Reg. 114/99, provides that, in
    exercising its discretion to award costs, the court must consider the following
    factors:</p>
  <p>(a)   the importance, complexity or difficulty of the issues;</p>
  <p>(b)   the reasonableness or unreasonableness of each party’s behaviour in
    the case;</p>
  <p>(c)   the lawyer’s rates;</p>
  <p>(d)   the time properly spent on the case;</p>
  <p>(e)   expenses properly paid or payable; and</p>
  <p>(f)   any other relevant matter.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,
    the issues at trial and the facts and evidence were complex and the primary
    issue on appeal was difficult and important.  As noted above, the respondent’s
    approach to the trial prolonged both the preparation and trial period and
    she is not entitled to shield herself from the consequences of her refusal
    either to make or accept reasonable offers to settle.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s disbursements at trial totalled $195,000 including GST. Approximately
    one-quarter of those disbursements related to the appellant’s obligation
    to value his assets and are not being sought as costs.  He seeks fees at
    trial of approximately $215,000 plus GST.  On appeal, he seeks fees of 32,364.45
    including GST, and disbursements of $2327.20 including GST.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    this Court has observed, costs awards, at the end of the day, should reflect “what
    the court views as a fair and reasonable amount that should be paid by the
    unsuccessful parties”: see <i>Boucher v. Public Accountants Council for the
    Province of Ontario</i> (2004), 71 O.R. (3d) 291, at para. 24.  Here, having
    regard to all of the relevant factors and considerations outlined above,
    the appropriate order for costs in our view is as follows:</p>
  <p>For trial – $275,000 to the appellant, inclusive of disbursements and GST</p>
  <p>On appeal – $25,000 to the appellant, inclusive of disbursements and GST</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Costs
    of the appeal and at trial are fixed in the foregoing amounts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Serra was making spousal support payments through FRO.  At the time of the
    costs submissions he was in arrears of approximately $140,000.  The outstanding
    arrears may be offset against the foregoing costs award.  The balance of
    the costs award may be offset against future spousal payments, so long as
    they are outstanding, but by an amount not to exceed one-half of the monthly
    spousal support payments.</p>
