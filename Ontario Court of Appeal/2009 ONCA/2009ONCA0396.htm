  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants moved for summary judgment in an action in which they are claiming
    a discharge of a debenture currently registered against the title to a 99-acre
    parcel of vacant land (the “Urlindale lands”).  The debenture was granted
    in 1979.  The appellants claim that the limitation periods relating to its
    enforcement have expired. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge dismissed the appellants’ motion, holding that steps have been
    taken to enforce the debenture and that, in any event, the validity and enforceability
    of the debenture were determined in another action.  Based on the latter
    finding, the motion judge also granted a cross-motion by the respondent 2108790
    Ontario Inc. for summary judgment: i) dismissing the appellants’ action;
    and ii) granting 2108790’s counterclaim and cross-claim for orders expunging
    all registrations against the title to the Urlindale lands by the appellants
    or by the co-defendant 1510232 Ontario Inc.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    we agree that the motion judge properly dismissed the appellants’ motion
    for summary judgment, we conclude that she went too far in making findings
    given the state of the record before her on the summary judgment motions
    and that she should have ordered that the action, counterclaim and cross-claim
    proceed to trial.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Background</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant, Carfrae Estates Limited, is a successor corporation to the company
    that granted the debenture to the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce on October
    9, 1979.  The debenture is a fixed and floating charge debenture and by its
    terms, it is payable on demand.  Carfare is also a successor corporation
    to a second company that acquired title to the Urlindale lands in 1976.  Carfare
    amalgamated with both companies in 1982.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>CIBC
    demanded payment of the debenture from Carfrae on November 15, 1984; it subsequently
    appointed a receiver-manager under the debenture on May 1, 1985.  Later,
    on February 25, 1986, CIBC registered the debenture against the title to
    the Urlindale Lands. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Anthony Graat is a principal of Carfrae.  In the summer of 1984, the Graat
    group of companies owed the CIBC approximately $38,000,000.  Carfare was
    directly responsible for $2,022,879.81 of this indebtedness; it was also
    responsible for the remainder of the $38,000,000 indebtedness under guarantees. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Between
    November 1984 and March 1985, the CIBC commenced various actions against
    Mr. Graat and his companies to realize on its security.  In March 1985, the
    parties reached a compromise under which Mr. Graat and his companies consented
    to various monetary judgments as well as to the appointment of private receiver
    managers of certain companies, one of which was Carfrae. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    the course of the Carfrae receivership, CIBC discovered that Carfrae had
    conveyed the Urlindale lands to the appellant Glencairn Plaza Limited (another
    Graat company) on April 25, 1985, prior to registration of the debenture.  In
    addition to certain other proceedings against Mr. Graat and various Graat
    companies, the CIBC brought an action to set aside the conveyance to Glencairn
    as being fraudulent against the CIBC.  The CIBC’s actions were tried together.  On
    November 13, 1992, the CIBC obtained a judgment declaring that the conveyance
    to Glencairn is void as against the CIBC.  On appeal to this court, that
    judgment was upheld.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    CIBC assigned the 1979 debenture to the respondent, 2108790, on October 31,
    2006.  Subsequently, the appellants brought their action claiming that the
    debenture is unenforceable because of the expiry of the applicable limitation
    periods.  The appellant Cornerstone Properties Inc. is a successor to Glencairn.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Discussion</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge’s decision to dismiss the appellants’
    motion for summary judgment and to grant 2108790’s motion for summary judgment
    was premised on the following conclusions:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>i)         the debenture is not statute barred
    because the CIBC previously took steps to enforce it by appointing a receiver
    manager, one of the enforcement mechanisms mentioned in the debenture; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>ii)        the validity and enforceability of the
    debenture was in issue, at least implicitly, in the fraudulent conveyance
    action and was therefore determined by the judgment in that action; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>iii)       because the validity and enforceability
    of the debenture was in issue in the fraudulent conveyance action, the appellants’ action
    for a discharge of the debenture based on the expiry of the limitation is
    an abuse of process. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    are sceptical that the motion judge’s first conclusion is legally correct.  We
    have not been provided with any authority to support the proposition that
    appointing a private receiver is “an entry or distress”, “an action to recover
    land or rent”, an “action ... to recover any sum of money”, or an “action
    upon a covenant” within the meaning of the <i>Real Property Limitations Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. L-15.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    based on our review of the record before the motion judge and of the trial
    judge’s reasons concerning the fraudulent conveyance action, it is far from
    apparent that a finding that this specific debenture was then enforceable
    was essential to a finding that the conveyance to Glencairn was fraudulent
    and void against the CIBC.  In any event, depending on what the limitation
    period is, a determination that the debenture was valid and enforceable when
    the fraudulent conveyance action was decided may not demonstrate that the
    debenture remains enforceable now.  The motion judge did not make a finding
    concerning the applicable limitation period.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the circumstances, if the appellants have a potentially viable claim that
    the debenture is statute barred, the motion judge's orders dismissing the
    appellants’ action and expunging the appellants’
    title to the Urlindale lands cannot stand.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    given the lengthy history of litigation between the Graat companies and the
    CIBC, we are not satisfied that the appellants have met the onus of demonstrating
    that there is no genuine issue for trial in relation to their claim for a
    discharge of the debenture based on expiry of the relevant limitation periods. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Apart
    from the debenture, the assignment of the debenture, some demand letters
    and the reasons and formal judgment in the fraudulent conveyance actions,
    none of the relevant documents relating to the steps taken by the CIBC to
    enforce its security are in the record that was before the motion judge.  Particularly
    in the light of the trial judge’s conclusions in the fraudulent conveyance
    action that effectively rejected several portions of Mr. Graat’s testimony,
    in our view, the record before the motion judge falls short of demonstrating
    that the debenture is statute barred. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the appeal is allowed, paragraphs 2 and 3 of the motion judge’s judgment
    are set aside and a paragraph is substituted stipulating that the cross-motion
    is dismissed.  Costs of the appeal are to the appellant on a partial indemnity
    scale fixed in the amount of $4,000.00 inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.
    Costs of the motions in the court below are in the cause. </p>
