style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    appeal addresses the availability of equitable set-off as between a regulator
    and a regulated party.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent, the Minister of Health and Long Term Care (the Ministry), claimed
    that $1,000,000.00 owed by the Crown as occupation rent for the use of an
    Oakville nursing home should be set off against $4,413,285.85 owed to the
    Crown by The Royal Crest Lifecare Group Inc. (the owner of the nursing homes)
    and one of its affiliates for over-subsidization of their nursing homes.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    parties agreed that, on the facts of this case, the issue turned on the application
    of the third criterion in <i>Holt v. Telford</i>, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 193 at
    212.  That criterion requires that the
    “cross-claim must be so clearly connected with the demand of the plaintiff
    that it would be manifestly unjust to allow the plaintiff to enforce payment
    without taking into consideration the cross-claim.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    application judge considered the third criterion and concluded that the Ministry
    was entitled to equitable set-off.  The appellant challenges this conclusion
    on three bases.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    the appellant argues that the application judge attached too much weight
    to the nature of the relationship between the parties instead of focusing
    on whether their respective claims - the claim for occupation rent and the
    claim to a return of surplus funding - were so closely connected that equitable
    set-off was justified. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    do not accept this argument.  As the cases of <i>Re Canadian Airlines</i>,
    [2001] A.J. No. 225 (Alta. Q.B.) and <i>Algoma Steel Inc. v. Union Gas Limited </i>(2003),
    63 O.R. (3d) 78 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) make clear, the closeness of the cross-obligations can only be assessed
    in the context of the relationship between the parties.  We read the reasons
    of the trial judge as doing no more than that.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    essence, the application judge concluded that because the respondent took
    possession of the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Oakville home to provide care for the residents, the respondent’s obligation
    for occupation rent arose from a decision to fund the operation of the nursing
    home directly as opposed to doing so indirectly by way of subsidy.  Viewed
    in that way, the cross-obligations are directly related.  The application
    judge’s conclusion on this issue was a reasonable application of the third <i>Holt</i> criterion
    to the facts of the case. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    the appellant argues that even if the application judge was correct that
    equitable set-off applied in these circumstances, the application judge erred
    in allowing set-off relating to all of the over-subsidized retirement homes
    rather than restricting it to the one home for which occupation rent was
    payable.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    do not accept this submission.  The application judge specifically found
    that the Royal Crest’s debt was a single corporate debt reflecting the fact
    that the regulator-regulated party relationship existed between The Ministry
    and Royal Crest rather than between the Ministry and the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Oakville nursing home.  This is confirmed by s. 113(3) of the regulations
    under the <i>Nursing Homes Act</i> R.S.O. 1990, c. N.7.  Moreover, it is
    consistent with the position taken by the trustee in its September 18, 2002
    report.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    the appellant argues that
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    Ontario’s use of the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Oakville home as a SARS residence cut off the relationship between the cross-obligations
    and changed the nature of the relationship between the parties, a matter
    not addressed in the application judge’s reasons. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    do not accept this argument.  The Ministry used the home to care for SARS
    patients consistent with its obligation under the <i>Health Facilities Special
    Orders Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.5.  The trustee at no time demanded the
    return of the home or took any steps to reclaim the use of the home.  In
    those circumstances, the closeness of the cross-obligation remained and it
    would be manifestly unfair not to apply set off to this period.  We note
    as well that, for the purpose of occupation rent, the settlement agreement
    reached between the parties did not separate these two periods.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber0><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly,
    the appeal is dismissed.  Costs to the respondent are fixed in the amount
    of $10,000 inclusive of disbursements and GST.</p>
