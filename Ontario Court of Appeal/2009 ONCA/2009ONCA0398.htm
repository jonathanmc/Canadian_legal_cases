    appellants Gary Eunick and Leighton Hay were jointly charged with first degree
    murder in relation to Collin Moore and attempted murder in relation to Roger
    Moore. Following a six-week trial before McCombs&nbsp;J. of the Superior
    Court of Justice and a jury, the appellants were found guilty as charged

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>OVERVIEW OF FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the early morning hours of July 6, 2002, two gunmen entered the kitchen area
    of a
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto nightclub and shot and killed Collin Moore. The gunmen also shot
    at Collin’s brother, Roger Moore, but he escaped with a slight graze wound
    to his forehead. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the evening of the shooting, Collin was hosting a monthly social and fund-raising
    event at the club. The event was popular within the Guyanese community and
    attracted a more sedate “middle-aged” crowd. Throughout the evening, Collin’s
    wife Jennifer, and his brother Roger, were stationed at the entrance door
    selling tickets and collecting money.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sometime
    after midnight, three or four men and a woman showed up at the club and refused
    to pay the $10 cover charge. Security approached to frisk them, but the men
    resisted and started pushing their way into the club. Collin and Roger Moore
    intervened to stop the intruders from entering and a fight broke out. One
    of the intruders was the appellant Gary Eunick. He was wearing a distinctive
    orange vest and the owner of the club recognized him as a club patron and
    a distant relative. The owner also recognized
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Gary’s brother Norval as one of the intruders. Norval was wearing a black
    bomber jacket and a white shirt with red stripes. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    third intruder who participated in the fight was wearing a blue plaid shirt.
    He was someone the owner did not recognize.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Collin’s
    wife Jennifer also knew Gary and Norval Eunick. She had seen them at the
    club on prior occasions and was aware that they had caused problems for her
    husband at the door. She too noticed a third intruder in the fight. He was
    wearing a blue plaid shirt, but she had not seen him before and did not know
    his identity.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Other
    patrons who were in attendance also described the fight between the intruders
    and Collin and Roger Moore. Although the scene was one of mayhem, with large
    numbers of people milling around the lobby, many, if not most of the patrons,
    identified three of the intruders by their clothing –
    one in an orange vest (known to be the appellant Gary Eunick), one in a black
    bomber jacket (known to be Norval Eunick), and a third in a blue plaid shirt
    (alleged to be the appellant Leighton Hay).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    the fight, beer bottles were broken and the glass door leading into the club
    was smashed. Gary Eunick left the fight cut and bleeding. Outside in the
    parking lot, he was seen by the club owner “fidgeting”
    with a gun and apparently loading it. The owner was on the phone to 911 at
    the time and he provided the operator with Eunick’s name and a full physical
    description, including the distinctive orange vest Eunick was wearing. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    the fight in the lobby, the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Moore brothers retreated to the kitchen area of the club. Minutes later,
    Gary Eunick and two other men returned to the club.
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Gary was still dressed in his distinctive orange vest. One of the other men
    was wearing a blue plaid shirt and he and Gary were each wearing a glove.
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Gary was armed with a semi-automatic revolver and the other man was carrying
    a long-nosed “barrelled” revolver. The two men were observed by witnesses
    walking purposefully towards the kitchen. They were overheard to ask if the
    other was “ready”. Moments later, they burst through the kitchen door, chased
    down the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Moore brothers and shot and killed Collin Moore. They also shot at Roger
    Moore, but he escaped with a slight graze wound to his forehead.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Collin’s
    wife Jennifer was in the kitchen at the time. She recognized Gary Eunick
    as one of the shooters and selected his photograph from a photo lineup later
    that day. Jennifer did not recognize the second shooter dressed in the blue
    plaid shirt – but she was not alone in the kitchen. Leisa Maillard was there
    as well. Ms. Maillard was a close friend of Collin and Roger’s sister and
    she had gone to the kitchen looking for her once the fight in the lobby had
    ended.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the gunmen burst through the kitchen door, Ms. Maillard confronted the man
    in the blue plaid shirt. She pleaded with him not to shoot Collin because “he
    has a wife and kids”. The man looked directly into her face, pointed his
    gun at her and said “shut your blood clot before I kill you”. He was about
    six feet away at the time. The kitchen was fully lit and she had a clear,
    unobstructed view of his face and body. Amongst other things, she noted that
    he was wearing a white shirt underneath the blue plaid shirt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    man then continued into the kitchen and he and Gary Eunick began firing at
    Collin and Roger Moore. Ms. Maillard kept her eyes trained on the shooter
    in blue the whole time. After several shots were fired, she fled through
    the kitchen door and found a hiding place in the main area of the club. Moments
    later, she saw the two gunmen pass by her as they left the kitchen. Once
    again, she had a clear view of the man in blue. She estimated that from the
    time he entered the kitchen to the time he passed by her, she had her eyes
    trained on him for a period of approximately 16 seconds.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Later
    that day, before the police had arrested anyone, Ms. Maillard selected Leighton
    Hay’s picture from a twelve-person photo lineup prepared by the police. The
    police had included Hay’s picture in the photo lineup because the owner of
    the club had seen Gary Eunick leaving the club in a car with a licence plate
    registered to Hay’s mother. As well, although the jury was not made aware
    of it, the police learned that Hay had a prior firearms conviction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    Ms. Maillard selected Hay’s photo, she indicated that she was 80 percent
    certain that the person in the photo was the man in the blue plaid shirt
    who had threatened her and then shot Collin. At trial, she testified that
    the person in the photograph was “the person [she] saw shoot Collin”. As
    for the seeming contradiction, she explained that because the photograph
    was a “photocopy” and not necessarily “a current photograph” and because
    of its “colour” and the fact that it did not “pick up the facial hair”, she
    had been cautious in using the 80 percent figure.  She gave that figure to
    the police officer in charge of the photo lineup because he “asked [her]
    to express it in those terms”. However, her “personal reaction” upon seeing
    the photograph was “that this was the man that shot Collin”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    around noon on July 6, the police arrested Gary Eunick and Leighton Hay at
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    6927 Chigwel Court in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Mississauga. Hay lived there with his mother and his sister Lisa, who also
    happened to be Gary Eunick’s girlfriend. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the home, which the police had under surveillance from shortly after 1:00&nbsp;a.m.
    on the morning of the 6th until the time of the arrest, the police discovered
    various items of evidence that were potentially capable of confirming Eunick
    and Hay’s involvement as the shooters.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    Eunick’s case, his blood-soaked orange shirt and blue jeans were located
    in a child’s knapsack deposited behind the Chigwel home. They had been wrapped
    in plastic bags and forensic testing revealed particles of gunshot residue
    on them. As well, Eunick’s shoes were located at the home and they contained
    particles of glass that were consistent with the glass from the broken door
    at the club.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    Hay’s case, the police searched a laundry hamper in his bedroom and underneath
    various items of clothing, they located bullets secreted in a sock wrapped
    in a purple plastic bag. According to the Crown’s firearms expert, one of
    the unfired bullets in the sock had been cycled through the semi-automatic
    handgun that one of the killers had used to shoot Collin Moore.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the same laundry hamper, the police located a white t-shirt. On it, the police
    found a particle of gunshot residue. No other gunshot residue was found on
    any of the remaining items of clothing in the hamper, including the sock
    in which the bullets had been secreted. Ms. Maillard, it will be recalled,
    had described the second shooter as wearing a white shirt underneath a blue
    plaid shirt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    police also found a newspaper in a bathroom garbage can that had been used
    to wrap small (less than a centimetre) curly hairs. No hairs were found in
    Hay’s bedroom, nor in the bathroom where the newspaper was located. However,
    beside Hay’s bedside table, the police found an electric razor with a cord
    wrapped around some clippers. On the clippers, the police located hairs that
    were also less than a centimetre in length.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Upon
    arrest, Hay’s head was shaved. A sequential photo lineup shown to Ms.&nbsp;Maillard
    several weeks after Hay’s arrest contained a picture of Hay taken on the
    day of his arrest. Ms. Maillard was unable to recognize Hay, in part, she
    explained, because the man in the blue shirt had picky dreads on his head
    approximately two inches long. Nor was Ms. Maillard able to pick out Hay
    at the preliminary hearing. Indeed, she selected Gary Eunick, who was seated
    with Hay in the prisoner’s dock, as the man she had seen in the blue shirt.
    Evidence presented to the jury showed that Hay had gained a lot of weight
    from the date of his arrest to the date of the preliminary hearing. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Hay
    did not testify at trial; nor did he call any witnesses on his behalf. Gary
    Eunick on the other hand did testify, along with his girlfriend Lisa Hay. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Eunick
    admitted that he was at the club on the night of the shooting and he was
    present in the lobby when the fight broke out. He denied taking part in the
    fight. When the fight erupted, he fell down in the vestibule near the entrance
    to the club. As the fight approached him, he went to the front door and when
    it would not open, he kicked the glass out – which explained the cuts to
    his neck and arm and behind his ear. Once outside, he found his girlfriend,
    Lisa Hay, and she drove him to her home in
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Mississauga. Upon arriving at Lisa’s home, he went immediately to the washroom
    adjacent to Leighton Hay’s bedroom. Both he and Lisa claimed that Hay was
    in bed asleep and Lisa closed the door leading from Hay’s bedroom to the
    bathroom to avoid disturbing him. She then left
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Gary in the washroom and a few minutes later, he joined her in the basement.
    Lisa cleaned the blood off of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Gary and then wrapped his clothes and threw them away because she did not
    want her mother to see the blood. Neither Gary nor Lisa mentioned anything
    about entering Hay’s bedroom and they were not questioned about the bullets
    that turned up in Hay’s laundry hamper.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    cross-examination, Lisa acknowledged as truthful her evidence from the preliminary
    hearing in which she testified that on the day of the murder, her brother
    Leighton’s hair was “maybe 3 or 4 millimetres” long, possibly a little bit
    longer than Gary Eunick’s. She was then shown some photographs of Gary and
    her brother Leighton taken before the murder. Both men had hair but she felt
    that
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Gary’s was longer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    viewing those photographs, Lisa immediately began to backtrack, volunteering
    that at the preliminary hearing she had been “guessing”
    about the length of her brother’s hair and while she had not been “lying”,
    she really could not recall the exact length of his hair at the time of the
    murder. When Crown counsel [not Ms Reid] suggested to her that her brother
    had shaved his head in the early morning hours of July&nbsp;6, prior to his
    arrest that day, Lisa replied: “I don’t believe that Leighton has a tool
    to shave his hair. He has a shaver for his face but not for his hair”. That
    evidence was belied by the clippers found in Leighton’s bedside table. Moreover,
    Lisa acknowledged that her boyfriend Gary Eunick worked at a hair salon and
    knew how to cut hair.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    both his factum and in oral argument, Hay placed little weight on the testimony
    of Eunick and Lisa. Indeed, he described the strength of the Crown’s case
    against Eunick as “overwhelming” and stated that it was “difficult to see
    that there was any meaningful issue for the jury to resolve in respect of
    Eunick, so conclusive was the evidence against him”. He further characterized
    the evidence given by Lisa and Eunick as “so palpably false that even if
    their exculpation of [him] were true [that he was in bed asleep when they
    arrived home from the club], the jury would not credit it”. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>POSITION OF THE PARTIES ON APPEAL</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Leighton Hay</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Hay
    submits that the verdicts against him are unreasonable. He seeks to have
    them set aside and replaced with verdicts of acquittal. Alternatively, he
    submits that the trial judge committed several errors in his instructions
    on eye-witness identification evidence and he seeks a new trial. Finally,
    he submits that the trial judge erred in his instructions on planning and
    deliberation and, if all else fails, he asks that the appeal from his conviction
    for first degree murder be dismissed and a verdict of second degree murder
    substituted. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Gary Eunick</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Eunick’s
    primary position on appeal is that the trial judge erred in his instructions
    on planning and deliberation. His submissions on that issue largely mirror
    those of Hay. Eunick also raises an issue touching on his identity as one
    of the shooters. Although he seeks a new trial on that issue, his primary
    goal on appeal is to have the first degree murder conviction replaced by
    a conviction for second degree murder. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS OF THE ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    mentioned, there is some overlap in the grounds of appeal relating to planning
    and deliberation. I propose to address those grounds after I have addressed
    the grounds unique to each appellant.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>GROUNDS UNIQUE TO LEIGHTON HAY</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Unreasonable verdict</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Hay
    submits that on the evidence adduced at trial, no reasonable jury, acting
    judicially, could convict him. He characterizes Ms. Maillard’s eye-witness
    identification evidence as all but worthless and he portrays as speculative
    the so-called confirmatory evidence found at his residence. With respect,
    I disagree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Maillard’s eye-witness evidence was not worthless. She had a clear view of
    the shooter for an extended period of time and she was able independently
    to select Hay’s photograph from a photo lineup shown to her hours after the
    event. As for her inability to identify Hay’s photograph on arrest, her explanation – that
    his appearance had changed from the night of the murder – was a matter for
    the jury, both in terms of assessing the reliability of her observations
    at the murder scene and as after-the-fact evidence capable of confirming
    Hay’s guilt. The jury likewise had her explanation for selecting Eunick as
    opposed to Hay at the preliminary hearing. It was for the jury to decide
    how, if at all, this would impact on the worth of her evidence implicating
    Hay as one of the shooters.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    sum, while Ms. Maillard’s eye-witness testimony required careful scrutiny,
    it was far from worthless. Whether it could have sustained a conviction on
    its own is something I need not decide. Contrary to Hay’s submission, her
    eye-witness evidence did not stand alone. The evidence located at Hay’s residence
    was, in my view, capable of confirming it. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    particular, the jury was entitled to consider as confirmatory the bullets
    hidden in Hay’s laundry hamper and the particle of gunshot residue found
    on the white t-shirt in the same hamper. As well, the jury was entitled to
    consider the hair clippings, in conjunction with Lisa Hay’s evidence about
    the length of her brother’s hair on the evening of the shooting, as evidence
    of an after-the-fact attempt by Hay to alter his appearance.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my respectful view, the analysis that Hay puts forward in relation to those
    items of evidence is misconceived. Absent any direct evidence from Lisa or
    Gary Eunick on the subject, Hay submits that Eunick may have put the bullets
    in the laundry hamper and that in doing so, he may have accidentally transferred
    a particle of gunshot residue onto the white t-shirt. While I accept that
    the evidence could support those inferences, it is equally capable of supporting
    the inferences suggested by the Crown – that Hay and Eunick were joint participants
    in the killing. For purposes of deciding whether a jury verdict is unreasonable,
    evidence that is capable of supporting an inference of guilt must be placed
    on the Crown’s side of the ledger, regardless of the fact that it might also
    be susceptible to an innocent explanation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    same reasoning applies to the hair clippings. While it is true that the clippings
    may have belonged to someone other than Hay and/or been present in the home
    before the night of the murder, the evidence is equally capable of supporting
    the inference that Hay shaved his head after committing the murder in order
    to alter his appearance. Lisa Hay’s evidence about the length of his hair
    at the time of the murder is particularly telling in that regard, as is her
    evidence that he did not possess hair clippers to shave his head. Indeed,
    in my view, Lisa’s evidence very much tips the scales in favour of the inference
    sought by the Crown – that Leighton Hay shaved his head after the murder
    to disguise his appearance.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
    that is a powerful inference. Combined with Ms. Maillard’s evidence, it is
    enough, in my view, to tip the scales and put this case over the unreasonable
    verdict threshold. Mr.&nbsp;Campbell, with his usual candour, does not strenuously
    argue otherwise.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But
    there is more. When the bullets in the hamper and the gunshot residue on
    the white t-shirt are added in, this case clearly crosses the unreasonable
    verdict line – and that is without factoring in, as I might have, Hay’s failure
    to testify in the face of <i>prima facie</i> proof establishing his involvement
    as one of the killers: see <i>R. v. LePage, </i>[1995] 1 S.C.R. 654, at para.
    29. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    leaving this ground, I note that in his factum, Hay places considerable emphasis
    on the fact that Gary Eunick’s brother, Norval, was injured in the original
    scuffle at the door and therefore was much more likely than Hay to have been
    the second shooter. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    oral argument, Mr. Campbell effectively abandoned that submission – and with
    good cause. Jennifer Moore, who was present in the kitchen when her husband
    was shot, knew Norval Eunick and could readily have identified him, as she
    did
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Gary, had he been the second shooter. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Alleged Errors in the Charge - Instructions on Eye-witness
      Identification</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    begin this section with the general, but important, observation that the
    charge as a whole was a model of fairness and balance. The trial judge went
    to great lengths to accommodate the parties and he stated their positions
    evenly and accurately, without favouring one over the other. It is against
    that backdrop that I consider the alleged deficiencies and errors in the
    charge, none of which competent trial counsel saw fit to raise with the trial
    judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Hay
    submits that the trial judge committed three errors in his instructions on
    eye-witness identification.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    he submits that the trial judge erred in instructing the jury that they could
    convict on the eye-witness evidence of Ms. Maillard alone.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would not give effect to this ground. The trial judge did not tell the jury
    that they could convict on the eye-witness evidence of Ms. Maillard alone;
    rather, in the course of his general instructions on eye-witness identification
    evidence, he told the jury that they were “entitled to convict on the evidence
    of even a single eye-witness if you accept that witness’ identification and
    find that it proves guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.
     But you should exercise real caution before convicting on this type of evidence
    alone”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    impugned instruction is a correct statement of the law: see <i>R. v. Nikolovski</i>,
    [1996] 3 S.C.R. 1197 <i>per</i> Cory J. for the majority, at para. 23.  Moreover,
    it applied in this case to the identification of Gary Eunick as one of the
    shooters. Jennifer Moore identified him as such and Hugh Robinson, the owner
    of the club, put a gun in his hands moments before the shooting. Both witnesses
    recognized Eunick from their past dealings with him and both selected him
    as one of the gunmen from a photo lineup within hours of the shooting. In
    the circumstances, the jury needed nothing more to convict Eunick of murder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his specific instructions to the jury about the eye-witness identification
    given by Ms. Maillard, the trial judge distinguished her evidence from that
    of Hugh Robinson and Jennifer Moore, stating that “she [Ms. Maillard] had
    never seen the person she picked out of the lineup –
    Leighton Hay – before. Her evidence must, therefore, be approached with greater
    caution”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    directing the jury to proceed in Ms. Maillard’s case with “greater caution”,
    the trial judge was reinforcing his earlier instructions to the jury that
    they should proceed with considerable caution before convicting on eye-witness
    testimony and should look for confirmatory evidence before acting on eye-witness
    testimony alone. In so instructing the jury, he explained time and again
    that eye-witness testimony is inherently frail, that human observations and
    recollections in this area are notoriously unreliable, that honest witnesses
    who appear convincing can be mistaken, that persons have been wrongfully
    convicted because eye-witnesses have made mistakes, and that many miscarriages
    of justice have been occasioned by eye-witnesses
    “whose honesty was not challenged and who had ample opportunity for observation,
    but whose identifications subsequently proved to be erroneous”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    in relation to Ms. Maillard, the trial judge specifically addressed the frailties
    in her evidence, including her inability to select Hay’s arrest photo and
    her misidentification of Eunick as Hay at the preliminary hearing. He reminded
    the jury of these frailties a second time in his detailed review of defence
    counsel’s closing address to the jury. Finally, after alerting the jury to
    the frailties of eye-witness testimony in general and to the particular frailties
    associated with Ms. Maillard’s testimony, the trial judge instructed the
    jury as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>You must be very careful of the evidence of Ms.
    Maillard because of the problems that I have pointed out. <i>You should look
    for other evidence confirming her identification</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the face of those instructions, it is fanciful to think that the jury would
    have convicted Hay solely on the eye-witness testimony of Ms. Maillard. On
    the contrary, they would have looked for confirmatory evidence – in accordance
    with the trial judge’s instructions – and found it in Hay’s laundry hamper
    and in his after-the-fact attempt to disguise his identify.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    Hay submits that the trial judge erred in instructing the jury as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Now, balanced against that, [the fact that at the
    initial photo lineup, Ms.&nbsp;Maillard was only 80 per cent sure that Hay
    was the shooter and that she did not identify Hay from his arrest photo or
    at the preliminary hearing] as I have said, is the fact that she [Ms. Maillard]
    picked Leighton Hay’s photograph out of the lineup before the police found
    him in the house. There is no evidence that she knew anything about Leighton
    Hay. Was this just an unlucky coincidence for Mr. Hay or was her identification
    shortly after the homicide accurate? That will be for you to determine, bearing
    in mind the caution that you must show and the obvious circumstances of frailty
    in this witness’ identification evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>According
    to Hay, that instruction was “deeply misleading with respect to the reliability
    of the Maillard photo lineup”
    because the absence of contamination “does nothing at all to ensure against
    an erroneous (though sincere) mis-identification”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would not give effect to that submission. The impugned instruction was given,
    to the knowledge of Hay’s counsel, in response to counsel’s inappropriate
    closing remarks to the jury that the police suffered from “tunnel vision” and
    had arrested Hay because he was a young black male who happened to reside
    at the Chigwel residence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That,
    of course, was not the case and defence counsel knew it. The police arrested
    Hay because Ms. Maillard selected his photograph from a photo lineup. His
    photograph appeared in that lineup because the police quickly learned that
    he lived at the address to which the getaway car was registered and he had
    a prior firearms conviction. To the extent, if any, that the impugned remarks
    may have prejudiced Hay, the prejudice, in our view, would have been greater
    had the jury learned of his prior firearms conviction – something the Crown,
    to Hay’s knowledge, could have led had his counsel pursued the tunnel vision
    theory in cross-examination with the police.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More
    importantly, in the particular circumstances of this case, I am not persuaded
    that the impugned instruction caused the damage alleged, nor indeed, that
    it was improper.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    assessing the reliability of Ms. Maillard’s selection of Hay as the shooter,
    I believe it was open to the jury to consider that in the absence of any
    possible taint, she selected a person who was closely affiliated with the
    person (Gary Eunick) who came with three other men into the club, who engaged
    in the fight in the lobby, and who eventually shot and killed Collin Moore.
    The trial judge quite properly left it to the jury to decide whether in Hay’s
    case, this was “just an unlucky coincidence” (or as Hay’s counsel put it
    in his closing address: “[Leighton’s] bad luck to be the brother of Lisa,
    whose boyfriend was Gary”) or whether, in the context of the whole of the
    evidence, it attested to the accuracy of Ms. Maillard’s identification. In
    the somewhat unusual circumstances of this case, I see nothing wrong with
    the impugned instruction. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    Hay submits that the trial judge erred in characterizing Ms. Maillard’s evidence
    as “identification” of him as the shooter in the blue plaid shirt. According
    to Hay, this characterization
    “significantly overstated both her testimony and the outcome of the photo
    lineup since she never purported to <i>identify</i> [Hay] as the shooter …” (emphasis
    in original).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    see no merit in this ground of appeal. The trial judge’s reference to Ms.&nbsp;Maillard’s “identification” of
    Hay as one of the shooters was a fair and accurate characterization of her
    evidence. Moreover, the word was not used in a conclusory sense; rather,
    it was accompanied throughout by a review of the strength and weaknesses
    of her testimony and the need for the jury to be “very careful” before acting
    on it and to “look for other evidence confirming her identification”.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>GROUNDS UNIQUE TO EUNICK</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Crown and Defence Firearms Experts</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Eunick
    raises two issues with the charge that his co-appellant Hay has not raised.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first relates to a conflict in the testimony of the Crown and defence firearms
    experts and in particular, whether in his charge, the trial judge left the
    jury with the erroneous impression that they could only act on the defence
    expert’s evidence if they “accepted” it. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    oral argument, although Mr. Lafontaine did not abandon this ground, he did
    not pursue it and we did not call upon the Crown to address it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his charge, the trial judge made it clear on numerous occasions that there
    was no obligation on Eunick to prove anything and that if the jury believed
    or had a reasonable doubt on the evidence, including the evidence given by
    the defence firearms expert, that Eunick was not one of the shooters, he
    was entitled to be acquitted. This ground accordingly fails.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>Post-offence Conduct</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second issue relates to the trial judge’s failure specifically to instruct
    the jury that they could only consider Eunick’s post-offence conduct in assessing
    the issue of his identity as one of the gunmen, and not the degree of his
    liability should identity be established. Once again, Mr. Lafontaine did
    not pursue this ground in oral argument and we did not call upon the Crown
    to respond to it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge only referred to Eunick’s post-offence conduct in the context
    of his instructions on identity. He made no mention of it in his instructions
    on planning and deliberation. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the trial judge could have given a specific instruction that Eunick’s post-offence
    conduct had no bearing on his degree of guilt, his failure to do so, in my
    view, was not fatal. The trial judge’s instructions on the use the jury could
    make of Eunick’s post offence conduct were clear and they focused exclusively
    on the issue of identity. As such, it is speculative to think that the jury
    would have used the evidence found at the Chigwel residence for any other
    purpose. Hence, this ground of appeal fails.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>COMMON GROUNDS OF APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Eunick
    and Hay raise two common complaints about the trial judge’s instructions
    on planning and deliberation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    they submit that the trial judge instructed the jury on those factors in
    the evidence that supported a finding of first degree murder, but failed
    to instruct the jury on the factors that pointed away from that characterization. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would not give effect to this ground. The trial judge properly instructed
    the jury on the twin elements of planning and deliberation and he provided
    the jury with the classic definitions of both terms.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    a later point in his charge, the trial judge reviewed with the jury “some
    of the factors that could, depending on the view you take of them, support
    a finding of planned and deliberate first degree murder”. The factors mentioned
    are set out below, in summary form:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    passage of time between the fight and the shooting.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    fact that the shooters went to the parking lot to arm themselves with guns.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    observations made by the club owner that Eunick appeared to be loading the
    revolver that Hay eventually used in the shooting.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>That
    each shooter was wearing a glove.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>That
    the shooters were attempting, to some extent, to conceal their identities
    by pulling up their shirts or pulling something up over their heads.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    identifying these factors, the trial judge reiterated his earlier instruction
    that “the factors that I have referred to and others that I have not referred
    to, could cause you to conclude that the killing was planned and deliberate …”.  He
    then continued as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>The defence argues that these factors are also
      consistent with a spontaneous decision to commit murder and do not support
      an inference of planning and deliberation beyond a reasonable doubt. That
      is a responsible submission</i>, just as the submission made by the Crown
      is a responsible submission. Both are worthy of careful consideration and
      you, ladies and gentlemen, have the responsibility to weigh and consider
      the evidence and the submissions on that issue and arrive at your own conclusions
      based upon the evidence. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Several
    pages later, having told the jury that the defence position was a “responsible” one,
    the trial judge reviewed in considerable detail Eunick’s submissions on the
    issue of planning and deliberation as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-subquote>Mr. Boutzouvis [counsel for Eunick] began with
    a discussion of planning and deliberation. He submitted that the Crown had
    not proved a calculated scheme or design that had been thought out and the
    consequences considered.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-subquote>Mr. Boutzouvis submitted that this was an impulsive
    act, not a considered act, not one where the killers took time to weigh the
    consequences as is required for a deliberate act.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-subquote>Mr. Boutzouvis pointed to the following factors
    that suggest, in his submission, this was not a planned and deliberate killing.
    He said that it happened fairly quickly after the bottle was used as a weapon
    in the initial fight. It happened within minutes of the fight ending, thus
    reducing the likelihood that this was planned and deliberate.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-subquote>He said that the mere fact, if you conclude
    it to be so, that there was acquisition of guns from a car in the parking
    lot, Mr. Boutzouvis submitted to you, that that fact does establish that
    this was not planned and deliberate, because it is consistent with a spontaneous
    decision to kill as well.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-subquote>The same thing is true, in Mr. Boutzouvis’
    submission, of the evidence of passing the gun to another person, likewise
      with the loading of the gun and putting on the gloves, concealing the features,
      none of these factors, in Mr. Boutzouvis’ submission, establishes that
      the killing was planned and deliberate. The same is true of having a third
      party lookout or by pulling the shirts over their heads on the way out.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-subquote>So Mr. Boutzouvis said: Look, even if you find
    that Mr. Eunick did all these things, even then you should not be satisfied
    beyond a reasonable doubt that this was a planned and deliberate murder.
    If you conclude all that, then the proper verdict is second degree murder,
    not first degree murder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge did not do a similar review for Hay because Hay’s counsel had
    not argued the issue of planning and deliberation in his closing address,
    choosing instead to focus on the issue of identity. Be that as it may, the
    trial judge’s instructions encompassed both accused and the jury would have
    realized that the submissions made on behalf of Eunick applied equally to
    Hay. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the appellants make the general complaint that the factors referred to by
    the trial judge were one-sided in favour of the Crown, their specific complaint
    is that the trial judge failed to bring home to the jury the fact that the
    accused were two young men who had just been involved in a fight and who,
    in a highly emotional state, acted improvidently, out of anger, rather than
    in the calm, reflective, thoughtful state “which the law calls
    ‘deliberation’”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    reject this submission for several reasons. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the trial judge was not obliged to mention every conceivable factor that
    might impact on the jury’s decision. The jurors were not born yesterday and
    they surely would have considered the emotional state of the appellants in
    arriving at their conclusion. They knew only too well that the appellants
    had just come out on the losing end of a fight at the entranceway to the
    club</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    neither counsel objected to the instructions given by the trial judge. Had
    they done so, the trial judge might well have mentioned the factors that
    counsel on appeal submit he should have. But had the trial judge done so,
    in fairness to the Crown, he would also have had to remind the jury of the
    evidence of various witnesses who described the appellants as calm, collected
    and focused. As for the improvidence of their actions in carrying out the
    murder in front of so many witnesses, the trial judge could have left it
    to the jury to consider whether the appellants were simply arrogant and believed
    that the witnesses would be too intimidated to come forward.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    short, further instructions along the lines suggested by counsel on appeal
    may have benefited the Crown more than the appellants, especially since the
    only evidence on the subject came from Crown witnesses – not Eunick, who
    denied any involvement in the killing and not Hay, who chose not to testify.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second common issue of the appellants on the instruction on planning and
    deliberation is that the trial judge erred in contrasting first degree murder
    with a “sudden impulse” killing and leaving it to the jury to choose “between
    those two ‘models’ of homicide”. In other words, according to the appellants,
    the jury should not have been invited to find that if the murder was not
    committed on “sudden impulse”, this meant that it must have been
    “planned and deliberate”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    reject that submission for two reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    in using the words “sudden impulse” the trial judge was effectively tracking
    the language used by counsel for Eunick in his closing address. In particular,
    counsel told the jury that “a murder committed on a sudden impulse and without
    prior consideration … is not a deliberate murder” and that “the particular
    act [here] was committed on an impulse, and on a spur of the moment, in front
    of a whole room full of people”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    view of those remarks, it is little wonder that competent trial counsel did
    not raise the objection that counsel on appeal complain about. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But
    of greater importance, the trial judge provided the jury with the following
    definition of “deliberate”:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>“Deliberate” is also a word that we use everyday
    but it has a little bit different meaning here than it does in our everyday
    lives. Usually when we say something is deliberate in our everyday lives
    we mean that it was intentional. When discussing what must be proved for
    first degree murder, however, deliberate means more than that the killing
    was intentional. Deliberate in this context means “considered” rather than “impulsive”;
    “carefully thought out, not hasty or rash”; “slow in deciding”; “cautious”.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>So a deliberate act in this context is one that
    the actor has taken time to weigh the advantages and disadvantages of. The
    deliberation must take place before the act of murder starts. A murder committed
    on a sudden impulse and without prior consideration, even with an intention
    to kill, is not a deliberate murder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[81]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thereafter,
    to the extent that the trial judge may have juxtaposed a murder committed
    on “sudden impulse” with a “deliberate” murder, in my view, he was merely
    giving the jury a shorthand version of the full definition of “deliberate” which
    the jury had earlier received. The trial judge was not required to repeat
    the full text every time the subject was broached. Competent trial counsel
    no doubt appreciated that and were content with the shortened version. Had
    they felt that it prejudiced their clients, surely they would have raised
    the matter with the trial judge. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[82]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants received a fair trial. The verdicts against Hay are not unreasonable.
    Accordingly, I would dismiss both appeals.</p>
