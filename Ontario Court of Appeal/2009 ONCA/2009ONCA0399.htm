    central ground of appeal is that the trial judge failed to consider the cause
    of action advanced on behalf of the appellant.  The appellant pursued her
    case, it is argued, as a negligence case and sought damages for the negligent
    infliction of mental harm that they argue is a free standing tort and the
    equivalent of nervous shock.  In addition it is argued the respondents negligently
    supervised the appellant thereby causing her compensable damages.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At
      its commencement, the appellant’s action was one for wrongful dismissal
      and related relief. However, by the time it came to trial the sole causes
      of action advanced by the appellant were intentional and negligent infliction
      of mental suffering and negligent supervision.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      respondent, the Canadian Musical Reproduction Rights Agency Ltd. (CMRRA)
      is a not for profit collective representing the majority of musical copyright
      holders in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    . The individual respondents are members of CMRRA’s senior management: Mr.
    Basskin is the organization’s President, Mr. Merritt is its Vice President
    and Ms. Rioux is the Director of Operations and was the appellant’s immediate
    superior at the relevant time.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant Maria Amaral worked in the office of CMRRA for 23 years and was
      at the time of her departure from the company, supervisor of royalties.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant’s difficulties began at the time the respondent company had begun
      a major restructuring of its operations.  The number of employees increased
      from 40 to 60 as the company moved from an “assembly line” model to a “teams” or “pod” approach
      in 2000.  At the same time the company began to move its royalty processing
      from an intensely paper world to an electronic one.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      May 2000 a manager’s position in the appellant’s department became vacant
      and was not immediately filled.  On the evidence, the appellant began to
      take on some of the work formerly done by the manager and in July 2000
      the appellant approached Merritt to see if she might be promoted to manager
      of royalties.  She felt she deserved the title and Merritt suggested she
      speak with Rioux.  Her request was not granted.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Subsequently
      when Rioux asked the appellant to write a letter for her, the appellant
      refused and set out her position in an email to Rioux on August 10, 2000
      as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>As I’m sure that you’re aware,
      this letter is something that the Manager of Royalties would do. Since
      I am not the Manager of Royalties, I am not in a position to write such
      a letter and as such cannot add any more responsibility or work to my plate.  If
      my role as Supervisor of Royalties is to change, then I suggest that we
      please arrange a time to discus this further.  Until then, I will continue
      to proceed with my duties as they are and have been.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant’s refusal to write the letter bordered on insubordination and
      as a result she was called to meet with management. A letter confirming
      the substance of those discussions was later placed in her personnel file.  A
      week after receipt of this letter the appellant attended at her family
      doctor and was diagnosed with acute depression for which she was prescribed
      a sleeping medication and Paxil, an anti-depressant.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Throughout
      the fall, as the trial judge noted, the appellant continued to feel resentful
      of Rioux.  Her performance declined and attendance and punctuality became
      an issue. Rioux assumed it was because the appellant was a disgruntled
      employee who had not been promoted. In January 2001 there were serious
      errors occurring in the implementation of the electronic system in the
      royalty department.  Rioux determined that the functions needed to be supervised
      more closely and divided the supervisory duties of the royalty department
      in two with the appellant holding the title and responsibilities of supervisor
      of royalty distribution and another employee supervisor of royalty processing.
      The appellant viewed this action as a demotion and a blow to her self esteem. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant’s difficulties with attendance and punctuality were another source
      of conflict between the appellant and her employers. The appellant always
      made up any time missed and felt unfairly dealt with while Rioux felt that
      as a supervisor the appellant should be setting a good example to her staff.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>These
      attendance issues came to a head April 12, 2001, when the appellant was
      away from work for an entire morning to attend a special mass for her late
      mother. She had not notified Rioux - to whom she reported - beforehand
      nor had she disclosed the reason for her lateness in the employee database
      as required.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Rioux
      reprimanded the appellant for her lateness. The appellant became upset
      and began crying. She felt she was being treated unfairly and even discriminated
      against because of her religion and wore dark glasses to a work party that
      afternoon to hide the fact she’d been crying.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>On
      May 1, 2001, Rioux again met with the appellant to discuss her attendance.
      Merritt was asked to come to the meeting when the appellant again raised
      the issue of discrimination.  When the appellant became upset the meeting
      was adjourned with nothing resolved.  Later that day Rioux left a notice
      of reprimand on the appellant’s desk warning her that a failure to report
      to work on time or leave a voicemail of potential lateness would result
      in future disciplinary action up to and including termination.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant attended work as usual on May 2 and 3. On May 4, however she
      did not go to work and instead attended at her doctor’s office where she
      presented as suicidal.  She suffered a complete mental breakdown and to
      date has not returned to gainful employment.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>In
      his note dated May 7, 2001, to the respondent, the appellant’s doctor did
      not disclose the reason for her absence from work.  He simply stated that
      she was ill and would be unable to work for a month.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>On
      May 15 and 30 Basskin wrote to the appellant to inquire of her status but
      received no response.  Merritt called her on the telephone several times
      but his calls were not returned.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Basskin
      again wrote to the appellant June 7, 2001.  At that point the appellant
      had been gone for over a month and all the respondent employer had was
      a further cryptic note which stated “This patient continues under my care”.  Basskin
      asked for “some general idea of what’s wrong and how long you anticipate
      being away
    …”.  She was told of the obvious difficulties in planning the operations
    of her department with no response from her. She was also told her duties
    had been permanently re-assigned and that she would be assigned work appropriate
    to her abilities and medical condition upon her return, after her performance
    review was completed.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Contrary
      to the assertion of counsel in argument in this court, the trial judge
      did not
    “fail to analyze” the appellant’s claim in negligence.  She very clearly
    did so in paragraphs 326 through 329 of her reasons for judgment; she concluded
    at para. 329 that there is no specific tort of negligent infliction of mental
    suffering available to the plaintiffs.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge said she had not been referred to any case in which the court
      has found negligent infliction of mental suffering as an independent actionable
      tort.  In the cases to which reference was made where courts found that
      an employer owes a duty to employees to treat them fairly, with civility,
      decency, respect and dignity, the breach of that duty is a breach of the
      employment contract exposing the employer to a claim for constructive dismissal.  All
      of the cases upon which the appellant relies were cases which included
      claims for wrongful dismissal, as was the case of <i>Piresferreira v. Ayotte </i></span>(2008)<span lang=EN-US>,

    before this court which holds that an employee has a free-standing cause

    his or her employer absent any allegations of breach of the contract of employment
    between the two.</span></p>

      trial judge concluded that the appellant’s problems began when she was
      not promoted to manager of the royalties division in which she worked in
      the summer of 2000. It was a week after the appellant’s refusal to write
      the BMG letter for Rioux and her subsequent reprimand that the appellant
      was diagnosed with depression and prescribed a sleeping medication and
      the anti-depressant, Paxil. Throughout the fall of 2000 she continued to
      feel resentful about the fact she had not been promoted while others around
      her, as part of the company’s re-organization, were.</span></p>

      punctuality and missing time from work was problematic particularly in
      December 2000 and into the new year.  The company had made its first effort
      to run the electronic program to deal with royalty collection and distribution
      and it had been a fiasco.  The appellant missed several meetings in December
      and was off for a time after Christmas into the new year.  Ms. Rioux was
      also off for a time over the holidays and when she returned the appellant
      was away. While the appellant’s holiday had been approved, her absence
      and unavailability to deal with the problems in her department contributed
      to Ms. Rioux’s frustration with her and the operational difficulties in
      the royalty department. The proposed solution to these problems - a division
      of the supervisory functions of the royalty department in the new year
      between the appellant and another employee - in turn, only contributed
      to the appellant’s feelings of inadequacy.</span></p>

      with punctuality and absences continued despite the fact that Mrs. Rioux
      had spoken to the appellant about these problems.  While the appellant
      felt “picked on”, the trial judge concluded that management’s requests
      were reasonable and in conformity with the company’s policy manuals and
      Merritt’s memo to the entire staff a year earlier.</span></p>

      the appellant perceived as a plan on the part of management to force her
      to quit or enable them to fire her for cause, the trial judge found reflected
      only the company’s desire to redeploy her to a position where she could
      function (and which would not constitute constructive dismissal) as well
      as its ability to terminate her if she did not perform adequately.  These
      goals the trial judge found were a legitimate reaction to what the employer
      saw as declining performance and increasing absenteeism. </span></p>

      trial judge also concluded that it was unlikely that the appellant’s symptoms
      were objectively apparent to the defendants to the extent that they were
      aware of any particular condition she suffered from, or any particular
      vulnerability on her part. Reasons for this included the fact that despite
      the appellant’s evidence that on the two days before her breakdown she
      came into work and simply stared at her computer, there are emails sent
      by her on those days which would indicate she was doing her work as usual.  In
      addition, in mid-April in an email to other staff the appellant reported “…feeling
      great these days” and indeed to Rioux on April 12, 2001.  “I’m not sick
      and I actually feel great and well.”  Co-workers who knew and worked with
      the appellant did not notice any signs or symptoms of depression or illness
      in the appellant in the time leading up to May 4.  </span></p>

      trial judge also found that despite her worsening depression, the appellant
      continued to work hard and put in long hours of overtime.  She told her
      co-workers she was feeling well
    “effectively masking her symptoms from those around her, who noticed nothing
    particularly different about her.” Her co-workers and management were shocked
    when her doctor’s note arrived advising that she would be off work for a
    month without any indication of the nature of her illness.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

      trial judge concluded from the employer’s perspective all of the events
      including: the increasing inability of the appellant to get her work done
      on time; the appellant taking more time off to visit her doctor; her late
      arrivals to work; and her absences from work were reasonably linked to

      trial judge concluded at paragraph 376 of her reasons:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>            Looking at all the
      evidence objectively, there is no question Ms. Rioux and the other members
      of the management team were demanding of employees, particularly in relation
      to the significant changes going on at CMRRA.  There is also no question
      that Ms. Amaral’s depression caused a deterioration in her ability to do
      her work properly and her ability to be punctual. This resulted in the
      downward spiral of events that culminated in the breakdown.  Given my findings
      concerning what was apparent at CMRRA, I cannot conclude that the employer
      should have seen more, or treated Ms. Amaral differently.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>and at paragraph 379:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>            I have already found
      that the defendants’ responses to Ms. Amaral’s declining performance and
      punctuality were proportionate and reasonable, as was placing a note in
      her personnel file.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>and at paragraph 393:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>            I find the defendant’s
      actions nothing more than reasonable, if firm, responses of an employer
      to the objectively declining performance of an employee.</span></p>
