  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Issue</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    oral argument before us, the jurisdiction of the
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario courts to try this claim was conceded.  We refer to the appellants
    throughout as the plaintiffs and the respondents as the defendants.  The
    issue before us is whether the motion judge erred in holding that
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario was not the forum with the closest connection to the plaintiffs’ action
    and in ordering that their action in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario be stayed in favour of
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Michigan. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Facts</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    May 23, 2007, the plaintiff, Lucia Silvestri, was driving on Highway I-96
    in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Grand Rapids,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Michigan.  A vehicle being driven by the defendant, Robert Hardy Jr., and
    owned by the defendant, Alta Lift Truck Services (“Alta”), collided with
    Silvestri’s vehicle.  Silvestri claims that the collision occurred when Hardy
    attempted to merge into the lane in which she was travelling.  Hardy’s position
    is that he had changed lanes because a car driven by an unknown driver, the
    defendant John Doe, was rapidly approaching his rear, and Hardy wished to
    avoid being hit by Doe’s vehicle.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Silvestri
    brought an action against the Hardy, Alta and Doe defendants for negligence
    in causing the accident.  Silvestri also brought suit against Lombard Canada
    Ltd., as she held an insurance policy with
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Lombard, and sought uninsured coverage, due to the fact that Doe cannot be
    identified.  Damages were also sought under the <i>Family Law Act </i>by
    Silvestri’s husband, Carlo, and her two minor children, Alisa and Victoria. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
    Silvestri understood that liability was going to be admitted,
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Lombard was let out of the action.  The action was never discontinued against
    John Doe.  It now appears that liability is very much in issue and the plaintiffs
    will have to bring
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    Lombard back into the action but have not yet done so. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Hardy
    and Alta brought a motion to stay the proceeding, claiming that the court
    did not have jurisdiction to hear the case, and that if it did have jurisdiction,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario was a <i>forum non conveniens</i>, as
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Michigan was a more appropriate venue.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge held that
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario had jurisdiction to hear the case but, after considering the factors
    in <i>Muscutt v. Courcelles </i>(2002), 60 O.R. (3d) 20 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) (“<i>Muscutt</i>”), he held that
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Michigan was the most convenient forum for the action.  In his brief endorsement,
    he noted that liability was a serious issue in the case, and that the defendants
    had six witnesses respecting liability, all of whom resided in
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Michigan.  He also noted that
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Michigan law would apply to both liability and damages, which would necessitate
    expert evidence on
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Michigan law if the action were to be heard in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario.  He exercised his discretion and granted a stay.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Three
    principles animate the exercise of judicial discretion concerning <i>forum
    non conveniens.  </i>They are: 1) to displace the plaintiffs’ choice of forum,
    a more appropriate forum must be clearly established; 2) the balancing of
    the relevant factors typically used to assess the connections to each forum
    should aim to achieve the twin goals of efficiency and justice; and 3) the
    motion judge should not adopt an aggressive approach to fact finding.  Where
    the more convenient forum cannot be decided by relying exclusively on uncontested
    or agreed-upon facts and the motion judge must address the competing versions
    of the facts, the judge should accept the plaintiffs’ version so long as
    it has a reasonable basis in the record:  see <i>Young v. Tyco International
    of Canada Ltd. </i>(2008),<i> </i>92 O.R. (3d) 161 (C.A.), at paras 28-33.  In
    addition, where an Ontario resident sues a defendant in Ontario as well as
    defendants who reside outside the province, the real and substantial connection
    test should not be applied to the claim against the latter as if it were
    a separate lawsuit from the claims against the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario defendants: see <i>McNichol Estate v. Woldnik </i>(2001), 150 O.A.C.
    68 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), discussed in <i>Muscutt, </i>at paras. 67-68. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge’s reasons indicate that he did not apply the above principles.  He
    does not appear to have given any weight to the plaintiffs’ choice of forum.  There
    is no recognition by him that the standard to displace the plaintiffs’ choice
    of jurisdiction is a high one.  Instead, his reasons reflect only a consideration
    of hardship on the defendants if the action was tried in
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario.  He does not consider hardship to the plaintiffs.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor
    did the motion judge consider the claim as a whole.
     Due to the fact the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Michigan defendants take the position the accident was caused by an unidentified
    driver, the plaintiffs will have to sue an
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario defendant, their own insurer, Lombard.  The action against Lombard
    can be maintained only in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario.  If the action against the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Michigan defendants is heard in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Michigan, the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario plaintiffs will have to bring two separate lawsuits with the possibility
    of conflicting decisions.  If the
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Michigan defendant Hardy’s position on liability is accepted in the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Michigan courts, the plaintiffs’ claim will be dismissed.  When suing Lombard
    in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario under the unidentified motorist coverage, if Hardy is found 1% liable
    then the plaintiffs will also be out of court.  There is a possibility for
    conflicting decisions if the action is tried in
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Michigan.  Such a procedure would not promote efficiency and justice. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    errors in principle require us to address the non-exhaustive list of seven
    factors identified as relevant to determining the forum with the closest
    connection and to conduct our own balancing exercise.  Our comments respecting
    each factor follow. </p>
  <h3>1.         The location of the majority of the parties</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the issue of liability, the four plaintiffs are resident in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario.  The
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario plaintiffs have some connection to
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Michigan in that two or three times a year for a period of approximately
    one month each time, their daughter receives treatment for her cerebral palsy
    in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Michigan.  She does not have the benefit of an insurer to cover the costs
    of litigation in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Michigan. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defendants, Alta and Hardy, have no connection with
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario.  Nor do their other four witnesses. </p>
  <h3>2.         The location of key witnesses and evidence </h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the issue of liability the location of the witnesses is split.  On the issue
    of damages, however, the witnesses (the physician, physiatrist, occupational
    therapist, and lay witnesses) will be mainly, if not exclusively, from
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Ontario.</p>
  <h3>3.         Contractual provisions that specify applicable law or accord
    jurisdiction. </h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    we explain below in the fifth factor (applicable law), this factor is not
    pertinent.</p>
  <h3>4.         Avoidance of a multiplicity of proceedings. </h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    factor has already been discussed by us above in commenting on the principle
    of efficiency and justice.  Although the defendants submit that the claim
    against
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Lombard is purely speculative, given the defendants’ position that the accident
    was caused by John Doe, we cannot agree.  This is not a situation of underinsured
    motorist coverage as in <i>Gajraj v. DeBernardo </i>(2002), 60 O.R. (3d)
    68 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) (“<i>Gajraj</i>”).<i></i></p>
  <h3>5.         Applicable law </h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants concede that
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Michigan law would apply to the issues of liability and damages.  If the
    matter proceeds to trial in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario, the defendants would be required to provide expert opinion evidence
    on the legal issues in respect of the law of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Michigan.  The costs of having liability and damages witnesses travel to
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario would be significant as would be the costs that would be incurred
    to adduce expert evidence on
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Michigan law.  These expenses will not, however, be borne personally by the
    defendants but by their insurer, Westfield Insurance.  The unfairness to
    the defendants is thus mitigated:  see <i>Sinclair v. Cracker Barrel Old
    Country Store, Inc. </i>(2002)<i>, </i>60 O.R. (3d) 76, at para. 18. 
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario law would apply to the claim against
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Lombard. </p>
  <h3>6.         Geographical factors suggesting natural forum. </h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    reasonable expectation of persons traveling abroad is that an accident in
    another country will be litigated there: <i>Gajraj, </i>at para. 16.   It
    is the natural forum. </p>
  <h3>7.         Whether declining jurisdiction would deprive the plaintiffs
    of a legitimate juridical advantage in the domestic court. </h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    plaintiffs concede that declining jurisdiction would not deprive them of
    a legitimate juridical advantage in the
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario courts.  However, see our comments in relation to avoidance of multiplicity
    of proceedings at para. 15. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Conclusion</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    fair weighing of the seven <i>Muscutt </i>factors leads to the conclusion
    that the plaintiffs’ choice of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario as the jurisdiction in which to try their claims has not been displaced.  When
    the location of the parties and their key witnesses is considered, the balance
    favours
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario.  While
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Michigan is the natural forum and
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Michigan law will have to be proved, allowing the action to be tried in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario avoids multiple proceedings and the possibility of conflicting decisions,
    thereby promoting the overarching goals of efficiency and justice. </p>
