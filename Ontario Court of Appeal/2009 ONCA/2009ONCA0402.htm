  <h4><span lang=EN-US>A.        INTRODUCTION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was found guilty of second degree murder following a trial before
    MacKinnon J. of the Superior Court of Justice and a jury.  Pursuant to s.
    72(1) of the <i>Youth Criminal Justice Act</i>, S.C. 2002, c. 1 (the “<i>YCJA</i>”),
    the trial judge ordered that the appellant be sentenced as an adult and imposed
    a sentence of life imprisonment with parole ineligibility for seven years.  Pursuant
    to s. 76(9) of the <i>YCJA</i>, the trial judge ordered that the appellant
    serve the first two years in a youth facility.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant appeals from the order of the trial judge directing the imposition
    of an adult sentence.  If successful, the appellant seeks an order declaring
    that s. 89 of the <i>YCJA</i>, which requires a young person who is 20 years
    old or older at the time a youth sentence is imposed to serve the sentence
    in a provincial correctional facility for adults, is unconstitutional.  If
    s. 89 of the <i>YCJA </i>is declared unconstitutional, the appellant seeks
    an order directing that he be placed in a youth facility.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>B.        FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>            <span
class=Heading4Char><span lang=EN-US>(1)       </span></span><b><u>The crime</u></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Roughly
    14 weeks before his 18<sup>th</sup> birthday, the appellant, with his friend
    Dean Ireland, went to the house of James Giles, the appellant’s 69-year-old
    nearly blind neighbour.  The appellant and
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Ireland</st1:country-region>
    wanted to steal money from Mr. Giles.  They provided false names to Mr. Giles,
    who invited them into his home and served them food.  While Mr. Giles was
    lying on the floor watching television, the appellant struck him on the head
    at least four or five times with an axe.  The attack was unprovoked.  The
    appellant and
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Ireland</st1:country-region>
    then worked together to sanitize the house.  They stole cigarettes, a wallet,
    and cash before fleeing the house.  Mr. Giles’ body was later found in a
    grisly state by a volunteer from Meals on Wheels who had come to deliver
    food to him.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(2)       <u>The trial</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, the appellant testified that he hit Mr. Giles on the head with the
    axe only in an attempt to knock him out.  He said that he did not intend
    to kill him or to cause him serious bodily harm.  According to the appellant,
    as he swung the axe it inadvertently twisted in his hand and the sharp blade
    struck Mr. Giles’ head.  The appellant pleaded not guilty to first degree
    murder and argued that he was guilty only of manslaughter.  The jury convicted
    him of second degree murder.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(3)       <u>The sentence</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown applied pursuant to s. 64(1) of the <i>YCJA</i> for an order that the
    appellant be sentenced as an adult.  The defence submitted that the Crown
    had not discharged its onus of demonstrating the need for the appellant to
    be sentenced as an adult.  According to the defence, a youth sentence was
    appropriate both to hold the appellant accountable for his crime and to provide
    for his rehabilitation and eventual reintegration into the community.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge accepted that the appellant poses a high-medium risk for further
    violent behaviour.  He concluded that a youth sentence would not be of sufficient
    length to hold the appellant accountable for his crime.  According to the
    trial judge, a youth sentence would be inadequate to reflect the seriousness
    of the offence and the appellant’s role in its commission.  Moreover, it
    would be inadequate to provide reasonable assurance of his rehabilitation
    to the point where he could be safely reintegrated into society.  An adult
    sentence, on the other hand, would ensure that the appellant would be subject
    to state control for life.  In the words of the trial judge, “[a]ny less
    restrictive sanction or sentence would not sufficiently promote this offender’s
    responsibility, accountability, rehabilitation, reintegration to society,
    and sufficiently contribute to the long-term protection of the public.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge sentenced the appellant to life imprisonment with no eligibility
    for parole for seven years.  He ordered that the appellant serve the first
    two years of his sentence in a youth facility, after which time he would
    be transferred to a penitentiary.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant appeals the trial judge’s imposition of an adult sentence.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>C.        ISSUES<u></u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    are two issues on the appeal: </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>1.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Did
    the trial judge err by imposing an adult sentence on the appellant?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>2.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    the answer to (1) is “yes”, then is s. 89 of the <i>YCJA</i> unconstitutional,
    thus permitting the appellant to serve his entire custodial sentence in a
    youth correctional facility?</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>D.        ANALYSIS<u></u></span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            </span><span
lang=EN-US>(1)       <u>Adult sentence</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    72(1) of the <i>YCJA</i> sets out both the factors that a youth justice court
    must consider and the test it must apply when determining whether to impose
    an adult sentence on a young person convicted of committing a criminal offence:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>72(1) In making its decision on an application
    heard in accordance with section 71, the youth justice court shall consider <i>the
    seriousness and circumstances of the offence, and the age, maturity, character,
    background and previous record of the young person and any other factors
    that the court considers relevant</i>, and</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=center style='text-align:center'>. .
    .</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(b) <i>if it is of the opinion that a youth
      sentence</i> imposed in accordance with the purpose and principles set
      out in subparagraph 3(1)(b)(ii) and section 38 <i>would not have sufficient
      length to hold the young person accountable for his or her offending behaviour</i>,
      it shall order that an adult sentence be imposed.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pursuant
    to s. 72(2) of the <i>YCJA</i>, the onus of satisfying the youth justice
    court as to the matters referred to in s. 72(1) rests with the Crown.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the present case, the trial judge considered the factors set out in <br>
    s. 72(1) and concluded as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I conclude beyond doubt that the Crown has fully
    discharged its burden of establishing that a youth sentence would be of insufficient
    length to hold Mr. Logan accountable for his crime.  A youth sentence is
    inadequate to reflect the seriousness of this shocking offence and his role
    in it.  It is also inadequate to provide reasonable assurance of his rehabilitation
    to the point where he can be safely integrated into society.  He accordingly
    must be sentenced as an adult.  With an adult sentence, when he is released
    into the community he will be subject to state control for life.  This control
    is necessary to protect the public.  Any less restrictive sanction or sentence
    would not sufficiently promote this offender’s responsibility, accountability,
    rehabilitation, reintegration to society, and sufficiently contribute to
    the long-term protection of the public.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge erred in concluding that a youth sentence
    was of insufficient length to hold the appellant accountable for his offence.  In
    support of this position, the appellant contends that the trial judge’s reasons
    reflect two legal errors: first, he erroneously fixated almost exclusively
    on the seriousness of the offence; and, second, he failed to recognize that
    the potential duration of the appellant’s sentence under both the <i>YCJA</i> and
    the <i>Criminal Code</i> was essentially the same and, therefore, an adult
    sentence was not required in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the trial judge properly considered the factors set out in s. 72(1)
    of the <i>YCJA</i> in a comprehensive and balanced fashion.  He did, of course,
    emphasize the seriousness of the crime.  That is not surprising; it was a
    serious crime, murder, and the circumstances of its commission, put bluntly,
    were horrific.  As expressed by the trial judge:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[The appellant] was significantly engaged in a
    horrific sneak attack on a vulnerable, defenceless, nearly blind senior citizen
    who had offered him food and kindness.  In doing so he exhibited extraordinary
    cruelty and inhumanity.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is essential that the trial judge address the nature of the crime in considering
    the notion of accountability set out in s. 72(1)(b) of the <i>YCJA</i>.  As
    explained by this court in <i>R. v. O. (A.)</i> (2007), 84 O.R. (3d) 561,
    at paras. 46 – 47:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In our view, accountability in this context is
    the equivalent of the adult sentencing principle of retribution as explained
    by Lamer C.J.C. in <i>R. v. M. (C.A.)</i> (1996), 105 C.C.C. (3d) 327 (S.C.C.),
    at paras. 80 and 81:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><i>Retribution in a criminal context, by contrast,
      represents an objective, reasoned and measured determination of an appropriate
      punishment which properly reflects the <u>moral culpability</u> of the
      offender, having regard to the intentional risk-taking of the offender,
      the consequential harm caused by the offender, and the normative character
      of the offender’s conduct.</i>  Furthermore, unlike vengeance, retribution
      incorporates a principle of restraint; retribution requires the imposition
      of a just and appropriate punishment and <u>nothing more</u>.</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>Retribution, as well, should be conceptually
    distinguished from its legitimate sibling, denunciation.  Retribution requires
    that a judicial sentence properly reflect the moral blameworthiness of that
    particular <u>offender</u>.  The objective of denunciation mandates that
    a sentence should also communicate society’s condemnation of that particular
    offender’s <u>conduct</u>.  In short, a sentence with a denunciatory element
    represents a symbolic, collective statement that the offender’s conduct should
    be punished for encroaching on our society’s basic code of values as enshrined
    within our substantive criminal law.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In our view, for a sentence to hold a young offender
    accountable in the sense of being meaningful it must reflect, as does a retributive
    sentence, “the moral culpability of the offender, having regard to the intentional
    risk-taking of the offender, the consequential harm caused by the offender,
    and the normative character of the offender’s conduct”.  We see no other
    rational way for measuring accountability.  [Emphasis in original.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    any event, the trial judge did not ignore or minimize the other factors set
    out in s. 72(1) of the <i>YCJA</i>.  He considered the appellant’s age (almost
    18), maturity, character, background, and previous record (none).  He acknowledged
    the difficult circumstances of the appellant’s family background and his
    problems in school.  He discussed the evidence of both Dr. Hucker and Dr.
    Gojer and recognized not only that “there is evidence of a recent improvement
    in [the appellant’s] attitude, behaviour and focus”, but also that the appellant “has
    made major strides in upgrading his education.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    summary, read as a whole, the trial judge’s reasons for imposing an adult
    sentence reflect a full and balanced assessment of all the factors set out
    in s. 72(1) of the <i>YCJA</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also submits that the trial judge failed to recognize, or take
    proper account of, the potential similarity between an adult sentence (life
    with eligibility for parole after seven years) and a youth sentence (six
    years and ten months, consisting of 34 months of pre-trial custody and four
    years in custody after sentence pursuant to <br>
    s. 42(q)(ii)(A) of the <i>YCJA</i>).  According to the appellant, this small
    divergence in the potential sentences did not justify foregoing the greater
    rehabilitative potential available through a youth sentence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the appellant’s description of the relative length of the two
    potential sentences.  Specifically, a youth custodial sentence of six years
    and ten months was a possibility because a trial judge is not required to
    subtract pre-trial custody from the four year maximum custodial sentence
    set out in s. 42(q)(ii)(A) of the <i>YCJA</i>: see <i>R. v. D. W.</i>, 2008
    ONCA 268, at para. 3.  Parenthetically, I observe that the trial judge properly
    understood this point; his comment that “[t]ime spent in pre-sentence detention
    (34 months) could also be deducted” indicates that he recognized that this
    type of reduction was a discretionary matter.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    I disagree with the appellant’s submission that the trial judge failed to
    recognize, or take proper account of, the potential similarity between an
    adult sentence and a youth sentence.  This submission fails to acknowledge
    a significant, indeed crucial, difference between the potential youth and
    adult sentences in this case, namely, that under an adult sentence, after
    he is released from custody the appellant will be subject to state supervision
    for the rest of his life.  Given the seriousness of the crime committed by
    the appellant (murder), the horrific circumstances surrounding its commission,
    the trial judge’s finding that the appellant “has shown little evidence of
    remorse for his crime or empathy for the continuing grievous loss suffered
    by the Giles family”, and the trial judge’s acceptance of Dr. Hucker’s opinion
    that the appellant is “at risk for further violent behaviour”, I see no problem
    with state supervision of the appellant for the rest of his life.  Such supervision
    is entirely consistent with the overarching sentencing goal of protecting
    the public from violent criminal conduct.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    I note that the court received and accepted considerable fresh evidence about
    the appellant’s rehabilitative achievements in custody.  Although these achievements
    are admirable, they do not alter the fair balancing of factors done by the
    trial judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, I conclude that the trial judge did not err by imposing an
    adult sentence on the appellant in this case.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            (2)       <u>The constitutionality of s. 89
        of the <i>YCJA</i></u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    light of my proposed disposition of the first issue, the constitutionality
    of  
    s. 89 of the <i>YCJA</i> does not arise.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>E.        DISPOSITION</span></h4>
