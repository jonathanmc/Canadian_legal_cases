  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    is a person, other than the named beneficiary, entitled to the proceeds of
    a life insurance policy?  That question lies at the heart of this appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the reasons for decision of the motion judge, he fully and fairly sets out
    the factual background.  I will repeat that portion of his decision here,
    with minor alterations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Michael
    Richardson married Stephenie Mary Mew in July 1965.  At that time, he was
    25 and she was 19.  Over the following 26 years, they raised two children,
    a boy and a girl.  Mr. Richardson was a rising star in a major Canadian publishing
    company and his work required frequent family moves, including one to
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">South Africa</st1:country-region>
    and one to the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">United States.</st1:country-region>
    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Mew, who had been working at the time of her marriage, gave up her job to
    concentrate on raising the children and managing the household.  After the
    children started school, she took a part-time job in sales.  When the children
    reached high school age, Ms. Mew opened a home decorating business which
    she ran for two years before she had to close it down when Mr. Richardson’s
    job required relocation to
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    New York.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Throughout
    this period, Mr. Richardson rose in the corporate ranks, ultimately becoming
    president of the company in 1990.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Around
    that time, Mr. Richardson became involved in a relationship with Anne Kathleen
    Ferguson, who was 24 years his junior.  This resulted in his separation from
    Ms. Mew in 1991 and their divorce in 1992.  At the time the motion below
    was heard, Ms. Ferguson was 44 years of age.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Richardson and Ms. Ferguson were married in May 1992, immediately after his
    divorce from Ms. Mew.  In the years that followed, they had three children,
    a boy and two girls.  The eldest child was 14 when the motion below was heard.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    March 1994, Mr. Richardson and Ms. Mew entered into a comprehensive separation
    agreement (the “Separation Agreement”).  Under the terms of the Separation
    Agreement, Mr. Richardson was required to designate Ms. Mew as the named
    beneficiary of a $100,000.00 Canada Life Insurance Company policy (the “Policy”)
    up to February 28, 1995.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the time of entering into the Separation Agreement, Mr. Richardson owned
    the Policy.  He had purchased it in 1990, while still married to Ms. Mew.  He
    misplaced the Policy in 1993 and, when Canada Life issued a replacement,
    he named Ms. Ferguson as the beneficiary.  The annual premiums for the Policy
    were $1,191.00 for the first five years and $1,116.00 thereafter.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    March 14, 1994, in fulfillment of his obligations under the Separation Agreement,
    Mr. Richardson signed a beneficiary designation in which he appointed Ms.
    Mew as the designated beneficiary, subject to revocation.  Ms. Ferguson’s
    evidence was that Mr. Richardson told her this was a temporary measure and
    that he would redesignate her as the beneficiary at a later date.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    1998, Mr. Richardson signed a will in which he appointed Ms. Ferguson as
    his trustee and left her his estate.  He also signed continuing powers of
    attorney in her favour over his property and his person.  The continuing
    power of attorney for property is relevant to the resolution of this appeal
    and shall be referred to as the “Power”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    1999, at the age of 59, Mr. Richardson was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease.  Initially,
    he was cared for at home.  Ms. Ferguson continued her employment but hired
    domestic help to assist with Mr. Richardson and the children.  In 2003, it
    became necessary to move Mr. Richardson into a retirement home and, in 2004,
    he was transferred to a long-term care facility where he remained until his
    death in November 2007.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    the onset of Mr. Richardson’s illness, Ms. Ferguson arranged for his pension
    to be converted into a registered retirement income fund, which was paid
    out between 1999 and 2007.  The total payments, including CPP, were in excess
    of $800,000.  Ms. Ferguson said that this income stream had been exhausted
    by the summer of 2006, and that after that time she paid all expenses, including
    the cost of Mr. Richardson’s care, out of her own income.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    Mr. Richardson’s death, Ms. Ferguson received the benefit of two insurance
    policies, with a combined value of $400,000.  She also discovered that Ms.
    Mew remained as the named beneficiary of the Policy.  The premiums on the
    Policy had been consistently paid by Mr. Richardson during the time he was
    capable of managing his affairs.  After about 1999, Ms. Ferguson paid the
    premiums from the joint bank account that she held with Mr. Richardson.  Ms.
    Ferguson said that because Mr. Richardson’s assets were exhausted in 2006,
    she paid the 2007 premium from her own funds, believing that she was the
    beneficiary.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Ferguson continues to live with her three children in a house in Forest Hill,
    an upscale residential area in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Toronto.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Mew says that she was devastated by the divorce and that she continued to
    love Mr. Richardson.  She says that she and Mr. Richardson treated each other
    civilly after the divorce and that she encouraged their children to have
    a relationship with their father and his new family.  However, she had no
    personal communication with Mr. Richardson between 1995 and his death in
    2007.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> After
    the divorce, Ms. Mew returned to school and obtained part-time work as a
    teacher.  She re-married in 1999 and separated from her husband in 2001.  She
    retired from teaching in 2006, at age 60, because she found it too demanding.  She
    is currently living in a modest one-bedroom apartment in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto.  As she never had a consistent job during her life with Mr. Richardson,
    her pension income is very modest.  She is currently 62 years old.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Ferguson brought a motion in which she claimed entitlement to the proceeds
    of the Policy (the “death benefit”).  She acknowledged that the Separation
    Agreement required Mr. Richardson to maintain Ms. Mew as the named beneficiary
    of the Policy until February 28, 1995.  However, she contended that Mr. Richardson
    intended to change the beneficiary designation after February 28, 1995, so
    that she would be the named beneficiary and it was only as a result of inadvertence
    that the change was not made.  She maintained that had she known that Ms.
    Mew was the named beneficiary, she would have used the Power to change the
    designation or stop making the premium payments.  She asked that a constructive
    trust be imposed on the death benefit to prevent Ms. Mew from receiving a
    windfall.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Mew refused to release her claim to the death benefit.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge found in favour of Ms. Mew and ordered that the death benefit,
    together with accrued interest, be paid to her.  Ms. Ferguson appeals.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE SEPARATION AGREEMENT AND AMENDING AGREEMENTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Separation Agreement dealt with the usual matters including spousal support,
    equalization of net family property, medical coverage, pension plan rights
    and life insurance.  It included mutual general releases and specific releases
    in respect of property and estates.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    relevant provisions of the Separation Agreement for the purposes of this
    appeal are as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>LIFE INSURANCE</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>11.       Michael owns a policy of insurance in
    the face amount of $100,000.00 through Canada Life Insurance Company bearing
    policy number <u>2994363</u>, which policy will expire on February 28, 1995.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>12.       Michael will irrevocably designate Stephenie
    as the sole beneficiary under this policy and file the designation with Canada
    Life Insurance Company as provided by the Insurance Act.  Michael will give
    Stephenie a true copy of the designation within fourteen days from the execution
    of this Agreement.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>13.       Michael will maintain Stephenie as beneficiary
    under the policy until February 28, 1995.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>14.       If Michael dies prior to February 28,
    1995, without this insurance in effect, his personal representatives will
    pay to Stephenie the sum of $100,000.00 and this obligation will be a first
    charge on his estate.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>15.       The amount (if any) of life insurance
    which Michael shall be required to provide for Stephenie’s benefit from and
    after March 1, 1995, shall be an issue to be determined in the variation
    proceeding contemplated by paragraph 8, above.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Separation Agreement provided for monthly support payments of $4,150 for
    the months of January and February, 1995, with the proviso that either party
    could apply for a determination of the appropriate quantum and duration of
    support after March 1, 1995.  If there were no application for variation,
    spousal support would remain at $4,150 per month.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Richardson and Ms. Mew entered into two subsequent amending agreements, both
    of which dealt only with support.  The first amending agreement was dated
    May 3, 1995.  Under its terms, Mr. Richardson was to pay spousal support
    of $4,150 per month up to and including April 1, 1995, and thereafter $2,500
    per month, pending the outcome of Mr. Richardson’s application to vary spousal
    support or other further written agreement.  In November of 1996, they entered
    into the second amending agreement.  Under its terms, Mr. Richardson agreed
    to pay spousal support of $2,500 per month for the three month period of
    July 15 to October 15, 1996, and thereafter $1.00 per year pending further
    variation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Paragraph
    11 of the Separation Agreement indicated that the Policy was to expire on
    February 28, 1995.  This was an error that the parties were unable to explain.  The
    Policy remained in effect after February 28, 1995, and Ms. Mew’s designation
    as beneficiary was never revoked.  Despite the two amendments to the Separation
    Agreement dealing with support, the subject of alternative life insurance
    arrangements after March 1, 1995, was never discussed between Mr. Richardson
    and Ms. Mew and the variation proceedings contemplated under the Separation
    Agreement either never occurred or were superseded by the amending agreements.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Mew acknowledged that Mr. Richardson fulfilled all of his obligations to
    her pursuant to the Separation Agreement and the amending agreements.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE DECISION BELOW</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge began his analysis by noting that a beneficiary designation
    in a life insurance policy is “normally unassailable”.  He referred to ss.
    171<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a> of the <i>Insurance Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8,
    which permit an insured to make and change a beneficiary designation by contract
    or declaration.  He noted that these provisions changed the law in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario as prior legislation provided that divorce had the effect of revoking
    the designation of a spouse as the beneficiary of a life insurance policy.  Now,
    nothing occurs automatically on divorce.  An insurer is free to change the
    designated beneficiary so long as the initial designation is not irrevocable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge then carefully considered the case law of this province and
    elsewhere.  He found that it supported a strict interpretation of the <i>Insurance</i> <i>Act</i> requirements
    for the change of a beneficiary, except in exceptional circumstances.  He
    concluded that there were no such circumstances in the present case.  At
    para. 57 of the reasons, he explained:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In view of the line of cases in this Court, reaching
    back to <i>McLean v. Guillet </i>[(1978), 22 O.R. (2d) 175 (

    Dist. Ct.)] and including, most recently, <i>Conway v. Conway Estate</i> [(2006),
    25 R.F.L. (6th) 106 (Ont. S.C.J.)], there are no circumstances that would
    cause me to conclude that the provisions of the <i>Insurance Act</i> should
    be over-ridden, based on unjust enrichment, to prevent an injustice in this
    case.  Counsel for [Ms. Ferguson] suggested that [Ms. Mew] had essentially
    rejected [Mr. Richardson] by not visiting him during his illness and not
    attending his funeral.  She may have had perfectly legitimate reasons for
    this, including grief, embarrassment and resentment, none of which affect
    the issues.  Counsel also suggested that [Ms. Ferguson] had been left with
    three children to raise.  It is not a matter of whether the former wife or
    the widow is more deserving, in the court’s view.  They both enjoyed long
    relationships with [Mr. Richardson] and were undoubtedly loving and caring
    wives, making substantial contributions to his happiness and well-being.  I
    cannot say that the circumstances cry out for relief.   </p>

    relation to unjust enrichment, the motion judge held that Ms. Mew’s designation
    as beneficiary under the Policy was a juristic reason for the enrichment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge rejected the submission that Ms. Ferguson could have used the
    Power to change the beneficiary designation or stop making the premium payments.  At
    para. 65 of the reasons, he stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I agree with the submission of counsel for [Ms.
    Mew] that the designation of a beneficiary under a life insurance policy
    is akin to a testamentary disposition. Counsel for [Ms. Ferguson] could point
    to no authority to the effect that an attorney can change the designation.
    I also query whether it would be a breach of the attorney’s fiduciary duty
    to change the designation in her favour, or to stop making premium payments,
    when the grantor himself had made no change to the designation for many years
    and had faithfully made the premium payments. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge recognized that he had the power to rectify the Policy, including
    rectification of the beneficiary designation: see <i>Sharom v. Sharom Estate </i>(1992),
    8 C.C.L.I. (2d) 14 (Ont. Gen. Div.); <i>Cockell v. Cockell and Mutual Life
    Assurance</i>, [1944] 4 D.L.R. 373 (Sask. C.A.); and <i>Cornwall v. Halifax
    Banking </i>(1902), 32 S.C.R. 442.  However, he was not satisfied that the
    evidence established that it was as a result of a mistake that Ms. Mew remained
    the named beneficiary or that Mr. Richardson’s true intent was to name Ms.
    Ferguson as beneficiary.  He noted that while the Separation Agreement contemplated
    that Ms. Mew’s designation was to be a temporary measure, it also contemplated
    that further life insurance arrangements might be put in place following
    the assumed expiry of the policy.  Further, the Settlement Agreement anticipated
    that variation proceedings might be commenced to determine the amount of
    life insurance, if any, that Mr. Richardson would be required to provide.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span

    para. 62 of the reasons, the motion judge concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The best evidence of Michael’s intention is that
    he did not change the beneficiary designation after February 28, 1995 and
    he continued to pay the premiums on the policy.  There is no evidence at
    all that this was a mistake.  It was faintly argued by Mr. Rachlin [counsel
    for Ms. Ferguson] that perhaps Michael was forgetful as a result of his incipient
    Alzheimer’s, but there is no evidence of this and the diagnosis was apparently
    not made until 1999.</p>

    Ferguson’s principal argument on appeal is that the motion judge erred in
    failing to find that Ms. Mew would be unjustly enriched by receipt of the
    death benefit.  The claim for rectification was raised in the notice of appeal
    and factum but was not pursued in oral argument.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant argues that the motion judge misapplied the doctrine of unjust
    enrichment.  Specifically, the appellant contends that the motion judge erred
    both in failing to find that she suffered a “corresponding deprivation” and
    in finding that there was a juristic reason for Ms. Mew’s enrichment.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s argument can be summarized as follows.  If Ms. Mew is permitted
    to receive the death benefit, she will be enriched.  Ms. Ferguson will suffer
    a corresponding deprivation because she paid the 2007 premium for the Policy
    from her personal earnings.  Further, Ms. Ferguson contends that had she
    known that she was not the named beneficiary, she would have used the Power
    to designate herself as beneficiary, ceased paying the premiums or cancelled
    the Policy.  In light of these considerations and the long estranged relationship
    between the deceased and Ms. Mew, it is argued, there is no juristic reason
    for Ms. Mew’s enrichment.  As further support for this position, the appellant
    points to the general release in the Separation Agreement and asserts that
    because Ms. Mew agreed to relinquish all rights to Mr. Richardson’s assets,
    it would be against good conscience to allow her to breach that agreement
    and claim the death benefit.       </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            <i>Was there a corresponding deprivation?</i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge made no finding as to whether Ms. Ferguson suffered a corresponding
    deprivation.  There was no need for such a determination given his finding
    that the beneficiary designation on the Policy amounted to a juristic reason
    for Ms. Mew’s enrichment.  As I explain below, I reach the same conclusion.  Accordingly,
    it is unnecessary to determine whether Ms. Ferguson paid the insurance premiums
    out of her own funds in 2007 and thereby suffered a “corresponding deprivation”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would note, however, assuming that Ms. Ferguson paid the 2007 premium with
    her own money, the amount she paid was $1,161, a very minor contribution
    to the cost of the Policy which had been paid for over the course of 17 years.  I
    question whether deprivation of such a minor sum – in comparison both to
    the total cost of the Policy and the amount of the death benefit of $100,000 – in
    the circumstances of this case, would warrant the imposition of a constructive
    trust.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    turn to whether it would be unjust for Ms. Mew to receive the death benefit,

    herself the beneficiary, cancel the Policy or cease making the premium payments. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this regard, it will be recalled, the motion judge doubted that Ms. Ferguson
    had the right to take these actions because he was of the view that they

    is always a fiduciary, the scope of the attorney’s fiduciary duties depends
    on whether the donor of the power is incapable at the time of the transaction.  If
    the donor is mentally incapable, the attorney’s position approaches that
    of a trustee.  If not, the relationship between donor and attorney is similar
    to one of agency.  At p. 239 of <i>Banton</i>, Cullity J. explains:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>An attorney for a donor who has mental capacity
    to deal with property is merely an agent and, notwithstanding the fact that
    the power may be conferred in general terms, the attorney's primary responsibility
    in such a case is to carry out the instructions of the donor as principal.
    As an agent, such an attorney owes fiduciary duties to the donor but these
    are pale in comparison with those of an attorney holding a continuing power
    when the donor has lost capacity to manage property. … The attorney [for
    an incapacitated donor] must make decisions on behalf of the donor and, pursuant
    to sections 32 and 38 of the <i>Substitute Decisions Act, 1992</i>, he or
    she is a &quot;... fiduciary whose powers and duties shall be exercised and
    performed diligently, with honesty and integrity and in good faith, for the
    incapable person's benefit&quot;. The status of such an attorney is much
    closer to that of a trustee than an agent of the donor. </p>

    Richardson, putting her own interests aside: see <span

    SCC 9, at para. 125.  In <i>Elgi (Committee of) v. Elgi </i>(2004), 28 B.C.L.R.

    described the prohibition against using a power for the attorney’s profit,

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is the attorney’s duty to use the power only
    for the benefit of the donor and not for the attorney’s own profit, benefit
    or advantage. The attorney can only use the power for his or her own benefit
    when it is done with the full knowledge and consent of the donor. I am not
    aware of any authority that detracts from this principle in circumstances
    where the benefit is conferred on family members. [Citations omitted.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not understand Ms. Ferguson to suggest that she was entitled to change
    the beneficiary designation, cancel the Policy or cease paying the premiums
    during the time that Mr. Richardson was still capable of managing his property.
    To the extent that she makes such an argument, I would reject it.  Given
    that there is no evidence that Mr. Richardson instructed her to do any of
    those things, if she had so acted, she would have been in breach of her duty
    to carry out the donor’s instructions.  Furthermore, changing the beneficiary
    designation to herself would have contravened the prohibition against using
    the Power for her own benefit, as Mr. Richardson had not expressly consented
    to such a change.      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    Mr. Richardson became incapable, as has been noted, Ms. Ferguson owed him
    an even higher duty of loyalty when exercising the Power.  As a fiduciary
    in a role rising to that of a trustee, she was bound to use the Power only
    for Mr. Richardson’s benefit and any exercise of the Power had to be done
    with honesty, integrity and in good faith.  There is nothing in the record
    to suggest that a change in the beneficiary designation, cancellation of
    the Policy or a cessation of the premium payments would have been for Mr.
    Richardson’s benefit.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    any event, as the motion judge noted, the matter is moot because Ms. Ferguson
    took none of these actions and Ms. Mew remained the designated beneficiary.  Accordingly,
    the Power provides no basis for a determination that it would be unjust for
    Ms. Mew to receive the death benefit.    </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    begin with the facts.  According to para. 15 of the Separation Agreement,
    the amount of life insurance that Mr. Richardson was to provide for Ms. Mew’s
    benefit after March 1, 1995, was to be determined in a variation proceeding.  Neither
    party applied to vary the provisions of the Separation Agreement dealing
    with the Policy.  It cannot be said that Ms. Mew gave up any right to the
    death benefit by means of the general release in the Separation Agreement
    when that agreement contemplated, in para. 15, that the issue of life insurance
    benefits remained open.  </p>

    has not changed.  This result follows even where there is a separation agreement
    in which the parties exchange mutual releases and renounce all rights and
    claims in the other’s estate.  General expressions of the sort contained
    in releases do not deprive a beneficiary of rights under an insurance policy
    because loss of status as a beneficiary is accomplished only by compliance
    with the legislation.  The general language used in waivers and releases
    does not amount to a declaration within the meaning of the <i>Insurance Act</i>.  </p>

    proceeds were impressed with a constructive trust.  In the alternative, the
    plaintiff was entitled to rectification of the contract of sale to provide
    for the policy’s transfer to the deceased and the removal of the company
    as beneficiary.  In the further alternative, the court held that the purchasers
    would be unjustly enriched if the proceeds were payable to the company. The
    court was satisfied that there was a certainty, equivalent to a declaration
    under the <i>Insurance Act </i>by the deceased, that the company would no
    longer be the owner and beneficiary of the policy. As the motion judge found,
    the same cannot be said in this case.<i> </i>       </p>

    for Ms. Mew’s enrichment – she was the named beneficiary of the Policy.  That
    designation was never changed and the evidence did not satisfy the motion
    judge that there were exceptional circumstances justifying a change in the
    beneficiary designation.  Consequently, there is no basis on which to impose

    respect of the beneficiary designation, the motion judge found that the best
    evidence of Mr. Richardson’s intention was that he did not change the beneficiary
    designation after February 28, 1995, (despite having amended the Separation
    Agreement twice thereafter), and he continued to pay the premiums on the
    Policy after that date.  The premium payments made after February 28, 1995,
    included a period of time before Mr. Richardson was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s
    disease.  The record amply supports the motion judge’s finding on this matter.  The
    motion judge also correctly articulated and applied the legal principles

    I see no basis on which to interfere with the decision below on this issue.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>COSTS</span><u></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge awarded the respondent costs of approximately $25,000, all inclusive.  The
    appellant seeks leave to appeal the costs award and, if leave is given, will
    argue that the costs award is unfair and unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    court should set aside a costs award on appeal only if the trial judge has
    made an error in principle or if the costs award is plainly wrong: see
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <i>Hamilton</i><i> v. Open Window Bakery Ltd</i>., [2004] 1 S.C.R. 303, at
    para. 27.<a href="#_ftn7"
name="_ftnref7" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[7]</span></span></span></a>  Accordingly, leave to appeal a costs order should
    be granted only in obvious cases where the party seeking leave convinces
    the court that there are strong grounds on which the appellate court could
    find that the judge erred in exercising his or her discretion: <i>Brad-Jay
    Investments Ltd. v. Szijjarto </i>(2006), 218 O.A.C. 315 (C.A.), at para.
    21, leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused, (2007), 241 O.A.C. 394<i>n</i>.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the circumstances, I see no basis on which to grant leave.  The appellant
    has not shown any apparent error in principle in the exercise of discretion
    by the motion judge nor is the costs award “plainly wrong”.  While the appellant
    sees the respondent as having achieved a windfall, that does not disentitle
    the respondent to costs below.  Furthermore, that view does not make the
    costs award unfair or unreasonable.  Particularly in light of the respondent’s
    offer to settle, no injustice was occasioned by the motion judge’s costs
    award. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>DISPOSITION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I would dismiss the appeal, with costs to the respondent fixed at $7,500,
    inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
