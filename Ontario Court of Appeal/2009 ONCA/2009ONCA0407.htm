    appellant was convicted of sexual assault after a trial before a judge sitting
    without a jury.  The complainant was the thirteen year old daughter of the
    woman with whom the appellant was living at the time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    case turned entirely on the credibility of the complainant and the appellant.  Both
    testified.  The complainant described a single event in which the sexual
    assault allegedly occurred and the appellant denied that that event occurred.  The
    Crowns case rested entirely on the complainants evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge concluded that the appellant was not a credible witness and that
    the appellants denial did not leave him with a reasonable doubt.  In coming
    to that conclusion, the trial judge referred to three parts of the appellants
    evidence as the bases upon which he rejected the appellants evidence as
    incredible.  Having reviewed the transcripts both before and during counsels
    submissions, we are satisfied that the trial judge misapprehended the evidence
    underlying all three bases upon which he rejected the appellants evidence
    as incredible.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One
    of the reasons the trial judge rejected the appellants evidence is found
    in the passage quoted below:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>I also find
    it difficult to accept Mr. Caldwells evidence that over the one-year period
    he lived with M.B. there was no occasion when he was alone with A.B. at the
    trailer.  I therefore reject Mr. Caldwells testimony  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    fact, the appellants evidence both in-chief and in cross-examination was
    that he could not recall any day in which he arrived home for lunch at the
    trailer to find the complainant there alone.  It was her allegation that
    the assault had occurred when he came home for lunch.  There was no evidence
    from any other witness that conflicted with this part of the appellants
    testimony.  In fact, the evidence of the complainants mother was that the
    complainant spent little time at the trailer and spent most of her time in
    the town.  Properly understood, there was nothing inherently incredible or
    unworthy of belief in the appellants evidence that he could not recall the
    complainant being alone at the trailer when he arrived home for lunch.   The
    trial judge appears to have viewed the evidence as a global denial of ever
    being alone with the complainant.  The trial judge misapprehended the evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second reason the trial judge gave for the outright rejection of the appellants
    testimony is set out below:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>In his examination-in-chief
    his responses were unequivocal.  He testified that he had had problems with
    drug abuse but he had put those behind him before he met M.B.  Yet in cross-examination
    he conceded that he had continued to use drugs with M.B.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is not an accurate summary of the appellants evidence.  Properly understood,
    there is no real inconsistency on this point between his evidence in-chief
    and his cross-examination.  In-chief, the appellant testified that he had
    a drug problem earlier in his life and that he got help for that problem.  He
    testified that he was not using drugs when he met the complaints mother
    and that after they were together he found out that she was a drug user.  After
    one particularly bad episode, he forcefully removed her from the trailer
    and their relationship ended.  The appellant was not asked anything during
    examination-in-chief about his use of drugs during the relationship.  It
    cannot be said that he unequivocally indicated that he was not using drugs
    during the relationship.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    cross-examination he was specifically asked about drug use during the relationship.  He
    answered that question by acknowledging that on a few occasions he had slipped
    and had used drugs with the complainants mother.  There is no inconsistency
    between that answer and the answers he gave in-chief.  The trial judge misapprehended
    the evidence in finding a material inconsistency.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    third reason the trial judge gave for rejecting the appellants evidence
    arose out of an alleged inconsistency between the appellants evidence in-chief
    and the evidence he gave on cross-examination concerning his attitude towards
    the complainants mother after the confrontation that resulted in the termination
    of their relationship.  As with the second basis upon which the trial judge
    rejected the appellants evidence, on a fair reading of the examination-in-chief,
    which was very brief, and the cross-examination, we cannot see any material
    change in the evidence during cross-examination.  The appellant was simply
    asked about additional matters in cross-examination that were not put to
    him during his examination in-chief.  He answered the questions put to him
    on cross-examination and provided additional information.  That does not
    amount to giving inconsistent evidence.  Once again, we are satisfied the
    trial judge misapprehended this part of the evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    misapprehensions are significant and material to the outcome.  The verdict
    cannot stand.  The conviction is quashed and a new trial is ordered. </p>
