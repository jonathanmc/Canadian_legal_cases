    appellant was convicted of several charges involving allegations of the sexual
    abuse of his young nephew and niece.  The alleged assaults occurred over
    a prolonged period of time.  The appellant’s family was living with the complainants’ family
    for the first few months of that time period.  Later, the appellant’s family
    had their own apartment living in two different residences, but the complainants’ family
    visited regularly.  It was the crown’s case that over a significant time
    period the appellant repeatedly assaulted his nephew, almost always at night
    while the nephew and the appellant were sleeping in the living room.  It
    was the crown’s case that the appellant assaulted his niece on two separate
    occasions, one of which involved some vaginal penetration.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant testified in his own defence and denied the allegations.  Several
    witnesses also testified for the defence and denied the sleeping arrangements
    testified to by the complainants. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown did not attempt to have the evidence of one complainant admitted as
    similar fact evidence in respect of the other complainant.  Some of the evidence
    given by each complainant was, however, relevant to the charges involving
    the other complainant.  For example, both complainants gave evidence about
    the relevant sleeping arrangements.  Those arrangements were central to the
    crown’s case as it applied to the allegations involving the nephew.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Crown
    counsel quite properly concedes that, on the case as presented, the jury
    could not use any assessment it made of the credibility of one of the complainants
    in arriving at the verdict with respect to the counts involving the other
    complainant.  In other words, acceptance of the evidence of one complainant
    that he or she was sexually assaulted by the appellant did not assist the
    jury in determining whether he sexually assaulted the other complainant.  Crown
    counsel concedes that it would have been better had the trial judge expressly
    told the jury it could not use a finding that one complainant was credible
    to conclude that the other complainant was credible.  She submits, however,
    that the trial judge implicitly made it clear to the jury that they could
    not use a finding that one complainant was assaulted to support a finding
    that the other complainant must have been assaulted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;

    entirety of the relevant part of the charge on this matter is set out below:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'>[K.P.]  is charged
    with six offences.  He was charged with eight offences but two have now been
    dismissed.  There are two complainants.  Each charge requires its own proof.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=left style='text-align:left'> The real issue
    for you to decide, in this case, is whether the offences alleged by each
    complainant ever actually took place.  <u>Be careful not to jump
    to the conclusion that, if one complainant is telling the truth, the other
    must be telling the truth as well.  Nor should you jump to the conclusion
    that because the complainants allege similar conduct, they all must have
    occurred if anyone of them is proved.  It is up to Crown counsel to prove
    each charge independently of the others.</u>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    counsel have carefully taken us through the case law involving similar cases
    where evidence of more than one complainant was heard by the jury and there
    is no suggestion that the evidence of one complainant constituted similar
    fact evidence on the charges involving the other.  Counsel for the appellant
    submits that the charge in this case does not meet the requirements set out
    in cases like <i>R. v. M.B.</i> (1998), 130 C.C.C (3d) 353 (Ont. C.A.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree that the impugned instruction failed to make it clear to this jury
    that they were obligated to keep the evidence of one complainant relevant
    to the counts involving that complainant separate from the evidence of the
    other complainant relevant only to the allegations against that other complainant.  We
    think that the trial judge invited the jury to use the evidence relevant
    to the charges against each complainant in assessing the ultimate result
    as it relates to the other complainant.  When the trial judge admonished
    the jury not to “jump to the conclusion that if one complainant is telling
    the truth the other must be telling the truth as well”, he was implicitly
    telling the jury that they could reach that conclusion as long as they gave
    the matter careful thought before doing so.  In fact, the judge should have
    told the jury that they could not arrive at a verdict by reasoning that because
    one complainant was telling the truth the other complainant was also telling
    the truth.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge also failed to caution the jury against propensity reasoning.  He
    did not tell the jury that they could not use any conclusions they reached
    in respect of one complainant to conclude that the appellant was guilty on
    all counts because he was the type of person who would engage in sexually
    abusive conduct.  In our view, that instruction should also have been given. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    counsel for the appellant points out, the trial judge appears to have attempted
    to adapt the model jury instruction as it relates to cases where similar
    fact evidence is admitted to a case like this one where it was not suggested
    the evidence constituted similar fact evidence.  In doing so, he failed to
    make the points described above.  He also used the phrase “jump to the conclusion”,
    which while appropriate as a cautionary admonition in the context of similar
    fact instruction, is potentially very misleading in a case where the crown
    does not suggest that the similar fact evidence rule applies.  Where, in
    a case like this, there are allegations involving more than one complainant
    but no suggestion that the evidence of one complainant is admissible as similar
    fact evidence in respect of the counts involving other complainants, trial
    judges should follow the direction given in <i>R. v. M.B.</i>, <i>supra</i>,
    and subsequent cases.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    are satisfied that the non-direction described above is misdirection and
    constitutes an error in law.  The failure of counsel to object is only relevant
    to the possible application of the <i>curative proviso</i>.  Crown counsel
    quite properly, in our view, does not suggest that the <i>curative proviso</i> can
    be applied to the errors described above.  Consequently, the failure to object,
    while most unfortunate, does not affect the outcome of this appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=left style='text-align:left;
line-height:normal'>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    the misdirection, all of the convictions must be quashed.  We are also satisfied
    that the conviction entered on count 6 is an unreasonable verdict apart entirely
    from the misdirection.  Consequently, we would quash all convictions, order
    a new trial on counts 1, 2, 3, 5 and 7, and direct an acquittal on count
