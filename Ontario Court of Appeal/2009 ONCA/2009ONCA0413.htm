    a jury trial, the appellant was convicted of committing incest against his
    developmentally challenged daughter. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant was 27 years old at the time of trial but had the intellectual
    capacity of a thirteen-year-old. She testified that the appellant began having
    intercourse with her when she was eighteen years old and continued to do
    so until she moved out of the family home when she was 25. The complainant
    said the assaults happened about four or five times for five days out of
    seven and estimated that they occurred almost 2,000 times in a year. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition to calling the complainant as a witness, the Crown played a videotaped
    statement taken from the appellant by the police on May 20, 2005. The appellant
    denied the complainant's allegations. However, the Crown relied on portions
    of the appellant's statement as supporting aspects of the complainant's testimony
    and used the videotaped statement for the purposes of cross-examination.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant, his wife and their son, testified for the defence. The appellant
    again denied the complainant's allegations. The appellant's wife and son
    both indicated that although the appellant was alone with the complainant
    much of the time, neither had observed anything untoward in the relationship</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant raises two main issues on his conviction appeal:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>i) Did the trial judge err in dealing with issues relating
    to whether the complainant had a motive to fabricate?</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>ii) Did the Crown engage in misconduct that created
    a miscarriage of justice?<span

    the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal, set aside the appellants
    conviction and order a new trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>II. Analysis</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>1. Did the trial judge
      err in dealing with issues relating to whether the complainant had a motive
      to fabricate?</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge made two errors in dealing with issues
    relating to the whether the complainant had a motive to fabricate. First,
    he failed to edit the appellants statement to exclude questions inviting
    an explanation concerning why the complainant would fabricate her allegations.
    Second, he erred in his instructions to the jury by failing to correct misleading
    statements made by the Crown concerning the complainants motive to fabricate
    and by failing to caution the jury against attributing undue weight to the
    absence of evidence that the complainant had a motive to fabricate.</p>

      the trial judge err by failing to edit the appellant's statement?</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    his videotaped statement to the police, the appellant was asked on two occasions
    why the complainant would be making the allegations:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Detective: Okay. The allegations are that you sexually
    abused her from the time of 18 years old. What do you have to say about that?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Accused: It never happened.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Detective: Okay. Why would she be saying this?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Accused: Your guess is as good as mine. She has
    been in and out, in problems with boys. We have crashed down on her hard
    a few times about her boys' situations. And she has been screaming and yelling
    in the past... for five or six years, wanting a baby and that. And we go
    months, talking with her about that, and responsibilities.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>And then she would say, okay... and then two months
    later, she would be right back at it again. She has gotten into all (inaudible)
    boys. We have restricted her movements with them boys. And she rebelled against
    us and (inaudible). It could be all that. I have no idea.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Detective: So you have no idea why she is making
    these claims?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Accused: No.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Detective: And you are telling me that they are
    totally false?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Accused: At home there, she leaves no indications
    of any problems between me and her.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Detective: Why would she be saying this stuff?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Accused: And your guess is as good as mine.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    ruling that the appellant's videotaped statement to the police was voluntary,
    the trial judge raised an issue concerning the propriety of the police officer's
    questions to the appellant about why the complainant would be making the
    allegations. Defence counsel at trial (not Mr. Hicks), observed that the
    challenged portions of the statement might actually be helpful to the appellant
    because the appellant's answers would likely answer a question that would
    be in the mind of the jury. Nonetheless, defence counsel submitted that the
    challenged questions and answers should be edited from the statement because
    an accused person has no obligation to explain why a complainant might fabricate
    allegations and because the questions invited the appellant to state an opinion
    about the complainant's state of mind.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial Crown (not Mr. Stewart), submitted that it is neither customary nor
    correct to edit this form of questioning from police statements because an
    accuseds out-of-court statements explaining why a complainant might lie
    are properly admissible.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge decided not to edit these portions of the appellants statement
    but indicated he would provide the jury with special instructions concerning
    their use. Immediately before the videotaped statement was played for the
    jury, the trial judge gave the jury the following instructions:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>You will recall that at the opening of the trial
    this morning I said to you: &quot;There is absolutely, under our system of
    law, no obligation on Mr. L. to testify and to produce any witnesses or to
    produce any exhibits.&quot; The responsibility here rests with the Crown
    to prove their case beyond a reasonable doubt. And that means several things
    but one of the things is, he does not have to testify.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=center style='
text-align:center;line-height:normal;
'>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>During the course of [the police] investigation,
    there were, on two occasions a specific question asked by the police officer
    of Mr. L., a question which could not have been asked of Mr. L. had he been
    in court.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote> So when you listen to that question, remember,
    as I have indicated to you on several occasions already, he does not have
    to prove anything, he does not have to supply any evidence. The responsibility
    is always with the Crown.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The particular question has something to do with:
    Why would your daughter make up these allegations? And why would she say
    these things about you? And that invites from him a response. That invites
    from him an explanation. It puts him on the defensive. He has to come up
    with some reasonable explanation. At law, there is no obligation on him to
    do that.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree that the impugned questions and answers should not have been placed
    before the jury. However, in light of the clear and contemporaneous instructions
    given by the trial judge, I am satisfied that no prejudice arose in this
    case from the failure to edit this portion of the appellants statement. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Questions
    in cross-examination that ask an accused person to explain why a complainant
    would fabricate his or her allegations are improper for two reasons. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    as a general matter, it is improper to invite one witness to comment on the
    veracity of another: <i>R. v. Brown</i> (1982), 1 C.C.C. (3d) 107 (Alta.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) affirmed [1985] 2 S.C.R. 273. This principle has particular application
    to an accuser and the accused. As noted by Charron J.A. in <i>R. v. Rose</i>,
    (2001), 53 O.R. (3d) 417 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) at para. 27, this court has held repeatedly that it is improper to call
    upon an accused to comment on the credibility of his accusers. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    questions of this type create a risk of shifting the burden of proof because
    they may mislead the trier of fact into focussing on whether the accused
    can provide an explanation for the complainants allegations instead of focussing
    on the central issue of whether the Crown has proved beyond a reasonable
    doubt that the allegations are true: <i>R. v</i>. <i>S.(W.)</i> (1994), 18
    O.R. (3d) 509 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), leave to appeal to the S.C.C. refused, [1994] S.C.C.A. No. 290. ; <i>R.
    v. Ellard</i> (2003), 172 C.C.C. (3rd) 28 (B.C.C.A.). As this court said
    in <i>R. v. F.(C.)</i>, [1996] CanLII 623 (Ont.
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), such questions create a risk that the jury may draw an adverse inference
    if the accused fails to provide a reasoned or persuasive response.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Contrary
    to the submissions of the trial Crown, the fact that it may be appropriate
    for the police to ask such questions as part of an investigation does not
    mean that portions of an accuseds statement in which such questions are
    asked are properly admissible. This court made that clear in <i>F.(C.)</i>.
    In that case, even though no objection was raised at trial, this court held
    that portions of an accuseds statement to the police asking him to explain
    why the complainant made the allegations and why some people believed the
    complainant should not have been placed before the jury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless,
    I am satisfied that the trial judges clear instructions explaining why this
    form of questioning is improper and emphasizing that the onus is on the Crown
    to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, would have cured any prejudice
    that might otherwise have arisen. In the face of this instruction given before
    the videotaped statement was played, I see no real possibility that the jury
    would have been misled into focusing on any perceived failure of the appellant
    to provide an adequate explanation for the complainant's allegations rather
    than on the issue of whether the Crown had satisfied its obligation to prove
    guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    although the impugned questions may have led the appellant to volunteer that
    there were no problems in his relationship with the complainant, the appellant's
    relationship with the complainant was a subject that could properly be explored
    both in the appellant's statement to the police and in the evidence at trial.
    Evidence suggesting the absence of any reason to make a false allegation is
    a factor which juries, using their common sense, will and should consider
    in assessing a witness credibility: <i>R. v. Batte</i> (2000), 49 O.R.
    (3d) 321 (Ont. C.A.) at para. 120; <i>R. v. Mearow</i>, [2006] CanLII 33765
    (Ont.

    my view, there are significant problems with the way the motive to fabricate
    issue was dealt with during the balance of the trial. In order to address
    this issue, it will be necessary that I review the relevant events at trial
    in some detail.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>                        i) The Crowns opening address</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his opening statement to the jury, Crown counsel made it clear that he would
    be relying on the appellants comment to the police that that there was no
    trouble between him and his daughter to demonstrate that the complainant
    had no apparent motive to fabricate:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There are three important things that this man
    has to say to the police. Okay? The first one <i>I want this to ring in
    your ears all through the trial.</i> I want you to think about this when
    you make your final deliberations. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>He says to the police officer, There's no trouble
      between me and my daughter. I was not aware of any concerns whatsoever.</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It was a bombshell to him when he was arrested
    on or about May 20, 2005... No problems. <i>So you're gonna think about that
    in terms of her alleged motivation. </i>[Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>                        ii) The evidence relating
      to motive to fabricate</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Several
    witnesses gave evidence about the complainants relationship with the appellant
    and about the possibility that she had a motive to fabricate.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant testified in-chief that she had a good relationship with her
    father until the sexual abuse began. However, the complainant also noted
    that she was not allowed to go out at night and that the appellant asked
    her to leave the room if company came over. In addition, she described the
    appellant as controlling. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    cross-examination, the complainant acknowledged that she had told her parents
    she wanted to have a child; that her parents did not want her going out late
    at night; and that she had difficulty accepting the return of two of their
    foster dogs. The complainant denied suggestions that she wanted to be able
    to have the same things her working brother had, or that her allegations
    were based on things she had seen while watching pornographic movies.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the appellant alluded in his evidence in-chief to issues relating to the
    complainant wanting to have a child, wanting to go out at night and difficulties
    over returning the foster dogs, he acknowledged in cross-examination that
    there was no animosity between him and his daughter.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    cross-examination of the appellant's son, J.L., Crown counsel reminded J.L.
    of comments J.L. made to the police, suggesting that his sister made her
    allegations because she had to pay a total of $520 per month to her parents
    for room, board and cable TV and because she did not have the money to do
    what she wanted. The following exchanges took place:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q:        In fact, you were so desperate to help
    dad that you offered an explanation as to why this complaint had been made.
    Do you remember that? ... Let me refresh your memory. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>And Ill quote on page three... I think it was
    out of retaliation, stuff like that. Shes paying for cable. She pays $400
    rent, which I do as well. She's jealous that I'm working bringing money in
    and she is not. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>And then youre asked: Does she have freedom at
    the house? She can come and go where she pleases. I think she feels that
    she didn't have the money to do what she wanted. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>So, those are the questions and answers supplied
    by you as to why this complaint came. I suggest to you that  that's a pretty
    desperate thing you did on behalf of your father to make such an explanation.
    Do you agree?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A:        Yes</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q:        Now, let's get back to that desperate
    explanation, you agreed it's desperate, that you gave to the police in an
    effort to assist your father, let's just analyze that a little bit. Your
    opinion at the time, and I I imagine that it still is, is that she was upset
    about money issues, right?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A:        Yes, she was.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q:        All right. Well, let's analyze that for
    a second. Your position then and it still is, is that she didn't have enough
    money to do what she wanted to, right?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A:        Yes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q:        And she was jealous of you, right?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A:        Yes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q:<b> </b> Okay. Now, can we agree that N. was
    paying $400 a month room and board?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A:        She was.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A:        And in addition to that was she paying
    for cable?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A:        Yes. ... 120 odd dollars.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q:        And was she shouldering the whole brunt
    of that or did she split the 120 with you and your folks?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A:        Well she was complaining about that because
    she was paying the cable and I wasn't paying anything. But meanwhile, I was
    paying into into food.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q:        Will you agree with me that in the normal
    course of events, knowing human nature as you do, J.L., that if a daughter
    says to the police: &quot;My father has been having sex with me for seven
    years almost every day&quot;, that that girl is not likely gonna stay under
    that roof much longer?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A:        Yes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q:        Thank you. So we'll just play around
    with your theory a little bit. So now N. has to leave and for $520 a month
    she's getting room and board and cable. Can you get room and board and cable
    elsewhere for $520 in your opinion?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A:        In my opinion... no.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q:        No. It's not gonna happen. So funny theory
    you had there. Now, she's worse off financially by making the complaint. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>                        iii) The closing addresses
      of counsel</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    trial counsel dealt with the issues of the appellant's obligation to provide
    an explanation for the complainant's allegations, and the complainant's motive
    to fabricate, in their closing addresses. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Defence
    counsel essentially re-iterated that, even though the Crown might argue that
    there was no benefit to the complainant to fabricate the complaint, the appellant
    had no obligation to explain why she would do so. He pointed out that there
    was no evidence of where the complainant was living and suggested that any
    financial considerations the Crown might rely on were irrelevant. In addition,
    he suggested that making an allegation could be a way of getting out of the
    house to pursue a relationship. Finally, he reminded the jury that the police
    officers question asking the appellant why the complainant would be making
    her allegations could not be asked at trial and repeated the admonition that
    the appellant had no obligation to explain why the complainant would fabricate
    her allegations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown began his comments in this area by reviewing a portion of J.L.s evidence:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Let's deal with J. for a second, brother J. As
    you know by now and it's been reiterated more than once, the accused can't
    be asked to explain why someone has said something bad about him. <i>But
    that doesn't apply to other witnesses. So I felt free to ask J.,
    &quot;Tell us about that explanation you gave to the police, J., about how
    she was jealous of your income</i> and how she sort of wanted a little more
    balance between hers and yours.&quot; <i>And within about 30 seconds he had
    to admit that was full of it,</i> full of it. <i>Why? Because when she left
    the house she was worse off financially than before she made the complaint</i>.
    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Later,
    the Crown turned to the general issue of lack of motive to fabricate:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>Now, the last thing I want to talk about is
      lack of motive</i>. If all you heard from from
    on this point was my friend, you'd conclude that it was completely irrelevant.
    And I suppose he's basing that observation or submission on the fact, and
    I agree, you can't ask the accused about it. &quot;Hey, Mr. L., tell us why
    she'd make this complaint if it wasn't true?&quot; We are past that. But
    I can tell you right now and Justice Riopelle will reinforce in your mind
    that now is the time to think about that. Now, it is a critical factor in
    your deliberations, a lack of motive. Because you know what, thank goodness,
    the law is not an ass, at least not in this respect. <i>And you're not going
    to be asked, like 12 ostriches, to go to
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    Gillies

    Lake and stick your head in the sand and just ignore the fact this woman
    had no motive to lie.</i> </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>You don't have to ignore that. It's very important.
      And what's unusual in this case is, not only is there no motive to lie</i>,
      I'm going to spend a little time on that right now, everybody agrees she
      had a great relationship with her dad. You may have asked yourself, &quot;Why
      is that Crown attorney going on and on about that? Why is he reinforcing
      that in our minds?&quot; <i>Because it's critical now. You can and should
      use that in your deliberations</i>. No reason why. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>But we're gonna go past that. She had reasons
      not to lie. Put </i>yourself in her shoes. Twenty-seven years old with
      cognitive difficulties; barely surviving on the money she makes with the
      support of her family. She's lost it all. She's lost it all. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Now, you have to compare that to my friend's earlier
    suggestion, which is not based on the evidence, that she wanted to get out
    of the house. Well, let's think about that for a second. Did she have to
    cook up this story to get out of the house? The accused himself said she
    was free to go. And she did go and nobody held her back. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>Why did she have to bring this on herself? Why
      did she have to forever, and this is a horrible, horrible thing to say
      but it's true and we know it, why did she rupture this family forever?
      It's not a family anymore. It </i>can't be a family anymore. And that's
      despite all the mutual love and all the good times they had, and the fact
      he was a good father except for incest. <i>She threw it all away. That's
      lack of motive. That's more than lack of motive</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge gave the jury the following instructions on the motive to fabricate
    issue:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Through cross-examination of this witness and other
    evidence, they tried to it will be up to you to decide. This is one of those
    dangerous grounds that judges go on, but I am not sure, <i>it is up to you
    to decide, was there ever any reason for this disclosure to have been divulged
    the way it was</i>. There were some allusions to maybe there was jealousy
    between her and her brother with respect to him having money to buy things.
    Generally it seemed to have been, according to the evidence, a happy relationship
    between father and daughter, mother and daughter, brother and sister. Just
    a normal average home is what it seemed like. You have to consider all those
    things as well. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>The Crown made much of the fact that she may
      be even financially worse off now that she has made these disclosures.
      You can take that into account as well I suppose,</i> if you wish. <i>There
      has been a definite rupture in the family. Things will never be the same
      between this mother and daughter, between this father and daughter, as
      a result of those disclosures</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Now, <i>the father's version is that this never
      happened</i>. This is all somewhere up in la-la land. She made this up. <i>He
      cannot prove, as </i>[defence counsel]<i> has said to you, a negative.
      You just cannot prove a negative. That is why the responsibility is on
      the prosecutor to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt</i>. You can prove
      a positive and that is what he has attempted to do during this trial. <i>Even
      though the question can never be asked of the father, &quot;Why would she
      do this? Why would she make up these allegations?&quot; They did, during
      the trial, attempt to answer those questions. I have already alluded to
      what some of those answers might be. That is for you to decide.</i> That

'><b>            Discussion</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    significant problems relating to the motive to fabricate issue began with
    the Crowns cross-examination of the appellants son, J.L. In asking J.L.
    about his desperate explanation to the police, the Crown elicited what
    appears to be an answer to a question similar to the question the police
    asked the appellant, why would the complainant be making these allegations.
    As I have said, a question to any witness seeking to elicit that witnesss
    opinion of another witnesss credibility is improper and this cross-examination
    was improper for that reason. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    said, if this was the only problem that had occurred, it would not present
    a major issue. Although improper, the Crowns questions were close to the
    line. In his statement to the police, J.L. not only expressed his opinion,
    he also recounted facts capable of supporting a conclusion that the complainant
    was jealous of J.L. and unhappy about their respective financial obligations
    in their parents household. Had the questions been confined to eliciting
    those facts and any information J.L. had about the complainants new living
    arrangements, the questions would have been entirely proper.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the Crown went further and used this line of questioning as an opportunity
    to editorialize about the complainant's financial state when she left home;
    he then referred to his editorial comment as if it was evidence in his closing
    address; and he used his editorial comment in implicit support of his suggestion
    that the complainant had reasons not to lie.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    approach was prejudicial to the appellant because it allowed the Crown to
    reinforce and emphasize its position that there was no evidence of a motive
    to lie by leading inadmissible opinion about a possible motive to lie, and
    by discrediting the opinion with speculative editorial comment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    am referring here to Crown counsels response after posing the question to
    J. L., Can you get room and board and cable elsewhere for $520 in your opinion?.
    Following JL's answer, In my opinion  no, Crown counsel said, <i>No,
    she's worse off financially by making the complaint</i> (emphasis added.) </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since
    there was no indication that JL was aware of the details of the complainant's
    living arrangements after she left home and since J.L. couched his answer
    as an opinion, J.L.'s response to the Crown counsels question did not provide
    an adequate evidentiary basis for the Crown's conclusion that the complainant
    was worse off financially after she made the complaint. Moreover, Crown counsels
    statement of a conclusion in response to J.L.s answer was an improper editorial
    comment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his closing address, Crown counsel referred to J.L.'s explanation to the
    police concerning why the complainant would fabricate and stated that J.L.
    had to disavow his explanation because the complainant
    was worse off financially than before she made the complaint. As there
    was no other evidence at trial concerning the complainant's financial status
    after she left home, Crown counsels statement lacked an evidentiary foundation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the circumstances, rather than telling the jury that they could take account
    of the fact that the complainant may be worse off financially than she was
    before she made the complaint, the trial judge should have instructed them
    that there was no evidence at trial concerning the complainants current
    living arrangements and that they should not speculate about that issue.
    The trial judge should also have corrected the Crowns erroneous statement
    that he was entitled to cross-examine J.L. about his explanation to the police
    concerning why the complainant might be making her allegation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    considering the Crowns comments in his closing address about the absence
    of motive to fabricate as a whole, in my opinion, it was incumbent on the
    trial judge to caution the jury against attributing undue weight to the absence
    of evidence of motive to fabricate. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    will repeat certain excerpts of the Crowns closing for ease of reference:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Now, it is a critical factor in your deliberations,
    a lack of motive.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>You don't have to ignore that. It's very important.
    And what's unusual in this case is, not only is there no motive to lie ...
    everybody agrees she had a great relationship with her dad.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>But we're gonna go past that. She had reasons not
    to lie. Put yourself in her shoes. Twenty-seven years old with cognitive
    difficulties; barely surviving on the money she makes with the support of
    her family. She's lost it all. She's lost it all. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Why did she have to bring this on herself? Why
    did she have to forever, and this is a horrible, horrible thing to say but
    it's true and we know it, why did she rupture this family forever? It's not
    a family anymore. It can't be a family anymore. And that's despite all the
    mutual love and all the good times they had, and the fact he was a good father
    except for incest. She threw it all away. That's lack of motive. That's more
    than lack of motive. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    difficulty with these comments is twofold. First, they appear to suggest
    that the Crown proved lack of motive to fabricate when the evidence was not
    capable of supporting such a finding. Second, by asking highly  emotive rhetorical
    questions concerning why the complainant would create various negative consequences
    for herself, the Crown created a risk that the jury would jump to a conclusion
    that the complainant must be telling the truth if there was no demonstrated
    motive to lie.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his comments, the Crown made outright assertions that the complainant had
    no motive to lie and also referred to the complainant's reasons not to lie.
    Particularly when combined with the prior suggestion that the complaint was
    worse off financially after making her allegations, these assertions suggested
    that the fact of the complainants good relationship with her father and
    the negative consequences that she experienced proved that the complainant
    had no motive to fabricate.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    dealing with the issue of a complainants motive to fabricate, it is important
    to recognize that the absence of evidence of motive to fabricate is not the
    same as absence of motive to fabricate. As Rowles J.A. stated in <i>R. v.
    B. (R.W.)</i> (1993), 24 B.C.A.C. 1(B.C.C.A.), at para. 28: it does not
    logically follow that because there is no apparent reason for a witness to
    lie, the witness must be telling the truth. Put another way, the fact that
    a complainant has no apparent motive to fabricate does not mean that the
    complainant has no motive to fabricate. <a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[3]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainants good relationship with her father and the negative consequences
    she may have experienced as a result of making her allegations are not capable
    of proving that she had no motive to fabricate. As this court held in <i>R.
    v. White</i> (1996), <span style='line-height:200%'>29 O.R. (3d) 577, at
    p. 608,</span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;line-height:200%'> </span>(Ont.
    C.A.); affirmed [1998] 2 S.C.R. 72, in the context of an accuseds motive
    to commit a crime, evidence of a good relationship does no more than reinforce
    the absence of evidence of proved motive.<span class=MsoFootnoteReference> <a href="#_ftn4" name="_ftnref4" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[4]</span></span></a></span> The same reasoning applies to evidence of negative
    consequences that may ensue from making serious allegations. Although they
    highlight the significance of absence of evidence of motive, they do not
    prove the absence of a hidden motive.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the Crowns suggestions that the complainants great relationship
    with her father and the negative consequences she may have suffered by making
    her allegations amounted to no motive to fabricate required a corrective
    instruction from the trial judge to put the issue of absence of evidence
    of motive to fabricate into its proper context. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    in my opinion, the Crowns emotive rhetorical questions asking why the complainant
    would bring various negative consequences on herself also required a corrective
    instruction. The problem with these questions is that they called on the
    jury in a compelling way to focus on what had not been proven (a credible
    motive to lie) rather than on what was proven and therefore created a risk
    that the jury would reason that failure to demonstrate a motive to lie proved
    that the complainant was telling the truth.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Batte</i> at
    para. 121, this court identified the pitfalls that should be avoided in a
    trial judges instructions to the jury on motive to fabricate. The same pitfalls
    must be avoided in Crown counsels closing address:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>What must be avoided in instructing a jury is any
    suggestion that the accused has an onus to demonstrate that a complainant
    has a motive to fabricate evidence, that the absence of a demonstrated motive
    to fabricate necessarily means that there was no motive or, finally, that
    the absence of a motive to fabricate conclusively establishes that a witness
    is telling the truth. The presence or absence of a motive to fabricate evidence
    is only one factor to be considered in assessing credibility.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>I
      recognize that in <i>Batte</i>, this court concluded that the trial judge
      did not err when, in setting out the Crowns position at trial, he invited
      the jury to consider why the complainant would subject herself to the rigours
      of the trial process if her allegations were not true. This court stated
      that at least some of the potential problems arising from such an instruction
      are overcome by the trial judges general instructions on credibility.
      Further, the trial judges instructions in their entirety would not have </span>led
      the jury astray from applying its common sense to the question of why the
      complainants would make the allegations they did, and the significance
      of the answer to that question, to their overall assessment of the credibility
      of the complainants: <i>Batte</i> at para. 126. <span style='line-height:200%'> </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>However,
      in this case, by inviting the jury to focus on potential long-term negative
      life consequences to the complainant from making her allegations and characterizing
      them as reasons not to lie, in my opinion, Crown counsel in this case went
      far beyond the trial judges isolated reference in <i>Batte</i> and virtually
      invited the jury to reason that in the absence of a demonstrated motive
      to fabricate the complainant must be telling the truth.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finlayson
    J.A. highlighted this risk in <i>S.(W.)</i>, <i>supra</i>, a judge alone
    trial, when he said, at p.  519:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Crown on appeal conceded that it was improper
    for the Crown at trial to demand an explanation from the appellant as to
    why the complainant would make up what counsel referred to as &quot;this
    horrendous lie&quot;. There is no onus on an accused person to explain away
    the complaint against him or her. The trial judge should have resolutely
    rejected this approach. Instead he implicitly adopted it. He was favourably
    impressed with the complainant and the manner in which he testified and,
    consequently, he believed her. <i>He then subtly shifted the onus to the
    appellant, as accused, to give some explanation as to why the complainant
    would lie. Why would she bring all this grief upon herself and risk jeopardizing
    the close relationship between the two families if it were not true?</i> [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%'>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Particularly
      in the context of a developmentally challenged complainant, by emphasizing
      what the complainant may have lost by making the allegations and by suggesting
      that it had proven absence of a motive to lie, the Crown created a risk
      that the jury would jump from those factors to a conclusion that the complainant
      was telling the truth. It was, therefore, incumbent on the trial judge
      to neutralize that risk by providing corrective instructions. Rather than
      addressing the problems created by the Crowns closing, the trial judges
      instructions merely pointed out that it was for the jury to determine whether
      a motive to fabricate had been established. The trial judges instructions
      do not address how the jury should treat a failure to demonstrate a motive
      to fabricate. </span></p>

    the defence had raised some possible motives for the complainant to fabricate

    their view of the evidence relating to the complainants motive to fabricate,
    it was essential that the jury bear in mind that the accused has no obligation

    to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    effect of the trial judges failure to provide corrective instructions along
    these lines and along the lines I have referred to earlier in paras. 39 and
    40 respecting the Crowns errors on this issue, was to permit the Crown to
    bolster the complainants credibility unfairly. When combined with the impact
    of the Crowns conduct in unfairly undermining the credibility of the defence
    witnesses, which I will discuss in the next section, the overall impact is
    sufficiently serious to require a new trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>2. Did the Crown engage
      in misconduct that created a miscarriage of justice?</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    classic statement of the role of the Crown is that set out by Rand J. in <i>Boucher
    v. The Queen</i>, [1955] S.C.R. 16, at 23-24:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It cannot be over-emphasized that the purpose of
    a criminal prosecution is not to obtain a conviction, it is to lay before
    a jury what the Crown considers to be credible evidence relevant to what
    is alleged to be a crime. Counsel have a duty to see that all available legal
    proof of the facts is presented: it should be done firmly and pressed to
    its legitimate strength but it must also be done fairly. The role of prosecutor
    excludes any notion of winning or losing; his function is a matter of public
    duty than which in civil life there can be none charged with greater personal
    responsibility. It is to be efficiently performed with an ingrained sense
    of the dignity, the seriousness and justness of judicial proceedings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the conduct of Crown counsel in this case was so unfair
    and prejudicial that it gives rise to a miscarriage of justice. In particular,
    the appellant submits that the Crown's opening and closing addresses were
    improper and inflammatory. Further, he contends that that the Crown: improperly
    expressed his opinion concerning the appellant's guilt; inappropriately suggested
    to the appellant in cross- examination that the jury disbelieved him; improperly
    asked defence witnesses to comment on the veracity of other witnesses; was
    rude, demeaning, and abusive throughout his cross-examinations; led the complainant
    through crucial aspects of her evidence; and mischaracterized earlier evidence
    in forming his questions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not accept all of the appellants submissions concerning the alleged transgressions.
    However, I do agree that Crown counsel at trial engaged in some conduct that
    crossed the line of propriety. In my opinion, the Crowns general approach
    involved overstating the Crowns position, demeaning defence witnesses and
    at least impliedly injecting his personal opinion into the trial. Although
    perhaps not as egregious as Crown misconduct in some other cases, the overall
    impact of this approach was, on occasion, to unfairly cast defence witnesses
    in a bad light. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    will give some examples. Before doing so I will briefly outline one of the
    issues at trial to which some of the misconduct relates.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One
    important aspect of the Crowns case was the complainants testimony that
    the appellants wife caught the appellant having intercourse with the complainant
    when the complainant was 19. According to the complainant, her mother did
    not get particularly upset about this incident but rather simply told them
    not to let it happen again. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was asked about the incident when he gave his statement to the
    police. Although he denied any impropriety, he described an incident in which
    the complainant climbed in to bed with him and asked about a kiss. The
    appellant said he gave the complainant a little kiss and that, at that point,
    his wife walked in.  The appellant acknowledged that his wife told them she
    did not want to see them in bed together again. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, the Crown cross-examined both the appellant and his wife extensively
    about this incident and alleged inconsistencies and improbabilities in their
    evidence became one of the focal points of the Crowns closing address.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I

      Crowns opening address</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    his opening address, the Crown said the following about the incident: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Now, I told you the accused gave a statement to
    the police. I'm going to play that video tape for you... and there are three
    important things that this man had to say to the police. Okay?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>And the third thing that he admits to is something
    that N. is going to tell you about and this is the blockbuster. This is a
    piece of evidence that I suggest to you at the end of the day is going to
    leave you with absolutely no doubt that this happened.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>When N. was about 19 or 20 so we're talking about
    the middle of the seven year period, maybe a little earlier than that-the
    sex was going on all through the day. Mom was out working 8:30 to 4:30 cleaning
    for the most part for two ladies. Mom never came home for lunch. One day
    she did. (Unintelligible) she saw her husband and her daughter having intercourse
    in bed. You have to ask yourself, what would the typical woman do? The women
    that I know would react in a very, very uniform way.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>But you're going to hear mom didn't get all excited
    at all. She said, &quot;L. and N. put your clothes on. We're gonna have a
    chat. I want this never to happen again. Do I have your promise? Do you promise&quot;.
    That was it. The very next day, surprise, surprise, more incest.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>You have to ask yourself what would a young gal
    in that situation, with her particular challenges, do when her own mom reacting
    that way, did nothing. Yeah. And her mom, I'll ask you to conclude, knew
    the sexual abuse was going on at least for the next three years. It's shocking
    isn't it, if you conclude that it's true. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    can be seen from this extract, the Crown portrayed the appellant as having
    admitted the conduct in issue. Although it was undoubtedly open to the Crown
    to ask the jury to find the appellant admitted that the incident occurred,
    the bald assertion of an admission overstated the Crown's position. Moreover,
    characterizing the appellant's wife's alleged reaction as shocking was improper

    Crown was often subtly disrespectful and demeaning when cross-examining the
    appellant. A prime example of such conduct was his habit of asking the appellant
    if he knew the meaning of the words used in questions posed in cross-examination:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        You know what analogy means.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    more flagrant example of improper conduct was Crown counsels tendency to
    refer to the jury in his questions and, on some occasions, to suggest that
    either he or the jury were having difficulty with the appellants answers:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        Now, let's talk about the locks on the

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        All right. So let's let's be frank here.
    If you're not in the picture, your wife is destitute.... Do you know what

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        Now, when I heard your testimony yesterday
    and I think the jury will agree that that was an important event in your
    life?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        No.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        No? Oh, okay. Well, let's examine that
    for a second. See how it stands up to a little scrutiny. You made this jury
    or gave them the impression that your wife was suspicious of what was going
    on. Are you going to deny that?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        That's very interesting. We've heard
    it before and were gonna go over it again but you know my question was: &quot;Did
    you feel your wife was suspicious about what was going on?&quot;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        No.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        Well, the jurys...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        Because there was </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.  having some difficulty...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.  nothing going on.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        
    with that, I think. Were gonna have some difficulty with that because, if
    your wife wasn't suspicious, she'd walk right on by and she'd do the laundry
    but instead she turns to you and says: &quot;What's going on here?&quot; That's
    the truth isn't it?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        Now, the jury, having heard your evidence
    yesterday, I'm sure has your most recent story fresh in their mind.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        All right. And that's basically what
    you told the jury but you left out an important part. All right?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        Asked for a kiss? Difference without
    a distinction or vice versa.  Asked about a kiss? Now isn't that totally
    different from what you told these good people just yesterday?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        Let's just deal with that for a second
    here. This was, whether you concede the point or not, I think the jury will
    conclude that this was an important event in your life. That your wife was
    suspicious that you were engaging in sexual activity with your own flesh
    and blood.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        All right. So your story is mixed up
    about why she came to the room: who kissed who. Let's talk about the hug
    for a second. You told these good jurors that when your wife walked in, she
    saw you hugging her, is that correct?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        Did you catch that difference too? Your
    wife  you said on the videotape that your wife said to you and N.: &quot;I
    don't want you in that bed together anymore.&quot; Did you not hear that?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        No, I didn't hear it.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        All right. Well, maybe the jury will
    sort that out for us.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        No. It happens... I think we're talking
    at cross-purposes here. Now, so we painted a picture of you being a swell
    father but you said something that Im sure struck the jury yesterday and
    is at complete odds with the portrayal youd have us believe. You told this
    jury that: &quot;I was angry when I heard about these allegations and if
    she had been present, I would've been yelling and screaming at her.&quot;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        You're avoiding the question. You're
    the one who threw it out. I didn't invent this. You and [defence counsel]
    broached it. I'm going to deal with what you told this jury yesterday and
    you can't deny it. You said that if she had been present and made these allegations
    in your presence, you'd be yelling and screaming in her face. Kind, loving
    and understanding father.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        Okay. And was there anything that was
    eating N. that was obvious to you outside of your relationship with her?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        Little bit, yes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        All right. It took little while to think
    about that one. I guess it wasn't so obvious. Well, what were those problems?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        She would run and sort of say she'd be
    here and not there, those little things.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        That makes no sense to me so I'm gonna
    move on, okay?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        Yeah.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        Let the jury make of it what they will.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        All right. So let's see if the jury can
    understand this. Your position now is, you were aware that your daughter
    has gone to the police to talk about sexual abuse at your hands and then
    your daughter says: &quot;Dad, let's go to counselling.&quot; And you told
    this jury you had no idea what that was about, the counselling.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>... </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        All right. We've done a bit of a 180
    degree turn here. I think the jury will remember, just 15 minutes ago under
    oath, I asked you what you understood the option of counselling was and we
    drew a big fat zero, a big blank. &quot;Your guess is as good as mine,&quot; you
    said to the Crown attorney.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        Well, how else can you cut it? How else
    can you cut this one? You tell the jury 15 minutes ago, &quot;I've no idea,
    Mr. Crown attorney. I've no idea why we're going to counselling.&quot; And
    now you admit to them there was no other possible reason but the allegation
    of incest. You lied to these people.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        That was just drawing a general conclusion,
    yes, that  what that counselling would be about but it wasn't for my participation
    in the counselling.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        A general conclusion. So what do we glean
    from that, that the main topic would be having sex with your daughter almost
    every day for seven years, in addition to that, I don't know, an eating disorder?
    You lied to these people didn't you?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A         No, I did not.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        We'll let them make that decision.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The court: Mr. [Crown attorney], that last comment
    was not necessary.</p>

    most serious example of Crown misconduct during cross-examination of the

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q. Ma'am, let's cut to the chase here. I'm going
    to tell you what I believe the truth is here. We're gonna see if we can agree,

    in bed with your daughter having full-blown sexual intercourse approximately
    1999 when your daughter was 19.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although

      Crown's closing address</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition to the improper conduct in his closing address that I have referred
    to under the first ground of appeal, Crown counsel used inflammatory language
    in referring to the appellant as a liar, improperly injected himself into
    the closing, demeaned the position of the defence and, at least implicitly,
    expressed his opinion that neither the appellant or his wife were worthy
    of belief and that the appellant was guilty:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>You know what the hallmark of a liar is? The
      hallmark of a liar</i> is to admit everything except the one little bit
      of information that will get you in trouble. So he's trying to be generous
      with the truth.  <i>That's the hallmark of a liar</i>, trying to suck you
      in and say: &quot;You know? I'll meet you halfway on this but I'm not a
      bad guy?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The truth never changes. But he tried to change
    the truth didn't he...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>They talked about what went on in the bedroom and
    how it was going be prevented in the future. That's the truth. But now he
    has a different story for you. He says: &quot;We told her. He told her you're
    not coming back in here anymore.&quot;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>Really? Did he have any such objections in the
      minutes before his wife caught them in there? I think not.</i> The truth
      never changes.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>Now, it seemed to me that those blatant and
      several contradictions would be enough for any jury to say to themselves,
      individually or collectively, &quot;We can't believe that fellow. He's
      not worthy of belief.&quot;</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>But it gets so much better for the prosecution.</i> It
    is almost of the Biblical story of manna from Heaven. <i>You don't expect
    it or even deserve it but it falls into your lap.</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>After those contradictions were revealed, the accused
    proceeded to shoot himself in the foot twice didn't he? <i>He lied to your
    faces twice</i>. That's what I suggest happened here.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>Now, what were those lies?</i> I'm sure they're
    still ringing in your ears. <i>And do you remember how the accused squirmed
    on the hook after I exposed it?</i> <i>Really, how foolish he looked trying
    to rehabilitate himself in your eyes</i>. It's not going to happen is it? <i>You
    know a liar when you see one</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>So what's the big, fat lie number one</i>? The
    first one is that: &quot;She wanted me to go to counselling&quot;.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>So here's the $64,000 question. &quot;Mr. L., why
    do you think she wanted you to go to counselling with her?&quot; Do you remember
    his response? It's something of a refrain he has, right? He used it twice
    to the police officer. He used it twice and cross-examination. &quot;Mr.
    Crown attorney, your guess is as good as mine.&quot; Your guess is as good
    as mine. As if to say: &quot;I have no bloody idea.&quot; <i>But you know
    that was a blatant lie to your face</i>. It wasn't the police officer. It
    wasn't a witness outside the court. It was to your faces.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Because on the heels of that, I asked him some
    more questions... I said: &quot;Well stop the presses here. You just said
    you had no idea... on the other hand you knew... So how do you square the
    circle?&quot;
    And his jaw almost hit the ground didn't it?<i> It's almost a small child
    example where you catch them in an obvious lie and they don't know what to
    do</i>. <i>They run in little circles and now they're caught in a corner
    and there's nowhere to go.</i> So what did he do? He basically tried to blame
    me for confusing him.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>But there's no confusion on your part is there?
    Thats crystal clear. <i>He lied to you. And the one big fat lie wasn't enough
    because he was in a downward spiral now. That's what happens when you start
    to lie... because one lie follows on another in desperation. The next lie</i> had
    to do with how he would've reacted to his daughter if shed had the gall
    to confront him with that in his presence instead of scurrying off tell the
    police... &quot;I would have screamed and yelled in her face.&quot;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I suppose an innocent man might do that. But what
    did he do? He said to her, knowing full well what this was about, basically:
    &quot;Honey I'll go with you to counselling.&quot;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>Big fat lie number two</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>...</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>Now, I'm having some trouble understanding my
      friend's position because it's somewhat inconsistent. Not that that's a
      bad thing. The defence can advance any number of possible defences</i>...
      the first one... emerged yesterday in questioning of Ms. L.... He put to
      her: &quot;You've watched a couple of porn flicks late at night, haven't
      you?&quot; &quot;Yeah, I have.&quot; &quot;And I suggest to you ma'am,
      that you're confused.&quot; And in essence what he said to her was:
    &quot;In your mind you and your dad were porn stars in those films.&quot; <i>I
    don't know about you but I almost fell off my chair with that one..</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>...</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Now, let's talk a little bit about <i>mom</i>.
    With great respect, <i>she doesn't deserve much comment does she?</i>[Emphasis

    acknowledge that there were few objections during the course of the trial
    to the Crowns conduct. However, although that is a factor to be considered,
    it is not determinative: <i>R. v. Jacquard</i>, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 314. The
    effect of some of Crown counsels transgressions, taken individually, may
    not have been apparent at the time. In my opinion, it is the cumulative effect
    of the improprieties under this ground of appeal and the first ground of
    appeal that undermines the fairness of the trial and requires this court
    to order a new trial.</p>

style='font-size:10.0pt'>, [1998] 2 NZLR 257, provides a useful discussion of
      this issue. In that case, the New Zealand Court of Appeal noted that the
      question spoken or unspoken, why the complainant would lie hovers over
      many [sexual assault] trials. Although the court ruled that the question
      can properly be asked, it also set out some useful guidelines concerning
      the proper limits on questions and submissions relating to this issue at
      pp. 265-266:</span></p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText>                       We accept the proposition
    &quot;Why would the complainant lie?&quot; should not be presented in a way
    which would deflect or distract the jury from the central issue, whether
    the Crown had proved the charge and each element of the charge beyond reasonable
    doubt. <i>Nor</i> should any suggestion be allowed that there was an onus
    on the accused to advance a credible answer. Generally, the trial Judge would
    be required to intervene firmly if these principles were infringed. </p>
  <p class=MsoFootnoteText><i>                       We also accept the distinction
      between questions relating to facts on the one hand and opinion on the
      other, and that absence of evidence of motive should not be equated to
      absence of motive</i>. There is a danger of descending into mere semantics,
      but in trials the situation where slight rephrasing is sufficient to overcome
      a proper objection is commonplace. <i>The question: &quot;Why should she
      lie?&quot; must be interpreted as and confined to the eliciting of facts
      known to the accused, not speculation as to possible motives. Likewise,
      any submissions by the prosecutor have to be couched in a way that observes
      the distinction.</i> [Emphasis added.]</p>
