  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    issue in this appeal from conviction for robbery by Eberhard J. and a jury
    is whether the appellant’s right to counsel under s. 10(b) of the <i>Charter
    of Rights and Freedoms</i> was violated when police questioned the appellant
    despite his desire to speak to his own lawyer.  In the unusual circumstances
    of this case, and given the trial judge’s findings of fact, it is my view
    that the appellant’s rights were not violated.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the early morning hours of November 6, 2005, someone flagged down a taxi
    driver in the City of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Barrie.  When they reached a remote stretch of the road, the passenger pulled
    out a crowbar, threatened the driver and demanded his money.  The driver
    fled the taxi and the perpetrator jumped into the front seat and drove off.  The
    perpetrator drove  a short distance to an elementary school where he abandoned
    the taxi.  Approximately 30 minutes later, the appellant placed a 911 call
    from a shopping plaza and claimed to have been the victim of an assault by
    a
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Barrie taxi driver.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile,
    the police had come to the assistance of the taxi driver, who provided a
    description of his assailant.  When the 911 call came in, the police officer
    who had been dealing with the taxi driver drove to the shopping plaza, bringing
    the taxi driver with him.  Once at the plaza, the taxi driver spontaneously
    pointed out the appellant as the person who had robbed him.  The police thereupon
    arrested the appellant.  However, in certain respects, the description of
    the assailant initially given by the taxi driver did not match the appellant.  Accordingly,
    the police decided that the appellant was also a victim and released him
    unconditionally.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE TAKING OF THE STATEMENT</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the appellant was released at the scene, the police continued to suspect
    he was involved in the offence.  On January 15, 2006, Constable Harris spoke
    to the appellant on the telephone and advised him that he would be arrested
    and charged with robbery and public mischief, and told him to come to the
    police station.  The appellant said that he would come in after work with
    a lawyer.  The appellant did not come in that day, but did come to the station
    on January 16, accompanied by his father.  He arrived around 7:20 p.m. and
    was immediately arrested for robbery and public mischief.  Constable Harris
    informed the appellant of his right to counsel under s. 10(b) and asked him
    if he wished to call a lawyer.  The appellant said that he did, that he wanted
    to call Angela McLeod.  He provided the officer with Ms. McLeod’s telephone
    number.  The officer asked the appellant if he had been in contact with Ms.
    McLeod that day and the appellant said that he had.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Constable
    Harris said he would call Ms. McLeod and wait for her to call back and the
    appellant could speak to her in private.  The appellant asked, “When do you
    actually talk to me?”  The officer said that since the appellant wanted to
    talk to a lawyer he had to give the appellant that opportunity, “And then
    afterwards we’ll—we’ll sit down an – and chat.”  The appellant asked what
    would happen if he could not get hold of her and the officer said that the
    appellant would have the opportunity to call another lawyer or a Legal Aid
    lawyer.  The officer said, in effect, that they could only do the best they
    could and if the lawyer was “out at a movie and not answering her—her telephone
    then you have the opportunity to talk to any other lawyer or—or we can call
    a Legal Aid lawyer”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant then said, “Well what would I say if I said that I think I might’ve
    done it?”  Constable Harris said he thought that would be the right thing
    for the appellant to say, to deal with this and that he had made a mistake.  The
    officer then said that since the appellant had asked to talk to a lawyer,
    he was obligated to contact that lawyer before continuing the conversation.  But,
    instead of calling the lawyer, the officer talked about how he would tell
    him the evidence he had against him and engaged in a long description of
    the “positive things” about his current situation, for example, that nobody
    was hurt, the property was recovered, and that the appellant turned himself
    in.  He continued as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If you—if you choose to tell me, you know, what
    happened, is positive. All these things are gonna help ya at the end of the
    day. The judge says – to look down and say well he – he turned himself in.
    He admi – he admitted his involvement. He did this, that, and the other thing,
    a-all that is gonna be, you know, that all goes down on my – the Crown brief
    that goes before the courts, that you were cooperative, uhm you know, again,
    you took responsibility for what ya did. And y-you know I can’t promise you
    what’s gonna happen, it’s out of my hands. It’s up to the Crown what sort
    of sentence they seek. I don’t see it as jus – I’ve been doing this for almost
    21 years, from past experience, uhm I don’t think it’s gonna be, uh if you’re
    convicted a-anything – anything very lengthy. Uhm the fact that you’re now
    employed, i-if that’s the case …</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    officer then went on to discuss bail with the appellant and returned to the
    fact that the appellant had made a mistake and that there might be other
    issues like drugs or alcohol.  The appellant said he was depressed from coming
    to Canada.  The officer again said he would call the lawyer, but instead
    of doing so talked to the appellant about a bad experience he had with another
    police force and how he could understand how traumatic it was for the appellant
    to leave
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Ireland</st1:country-region>
    .  The appellant then said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I haven’t got a clue why I done it, so.  I remember
    an acid tab from the summer and I was at my lowest point and I (inaudible)
    with a bottle of rum … I don’t know what happened.  I took the tab and then
    I remember being sick, like sick and I couldn’t walk and then next I know
    that I’m friggin’ – in a friggin’ taxi.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    officer then left the room to call Ms. McLeod.  He returned 19 minutes later
    at about 8:00 p.m. and said he had left two messages at the lawyer’s office.  He
    also said he had not been able to find any other number for her.  He told
    the appellant that he left a message for Ms. McLeod that the appellant would
    be held for bail at the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Barrie court.  The officer asked the appellant if he knew any other lawyer.  The
    appellant said “no”.  He then asked the appellant if he wanted him to call
    a Legal Aid lawyer but the appellant said, “I’d rather have Angela McLeod”.  After
    some further conversation while the officer and the appellant looked through
    the telephone book, the officer said he would check with the appellant’s
    father to see if he had any other numbers for Ms. McLeod.  The officer also
    said that the appellant would have a chance to talk to her before bail court
    the next day.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Constable
    Harris left the room and returned 26 minutes later at 8:30 p.m. to say that
    the appellant’s father did not have any other telephone numbers.  The appellant
    asked if he would be able to call Ms. McLeod before bail court.  The officer
    said that he would.  The officer then repeated that he was investigating
    a robbery and public mischief, that he had called Ms. McLeod and left messages.  He
    confirmed that the appellant did not want to talk to any other lawyer including
    a Legal Aid lawyer.  He then began to question the appellant about the robbery.  The
    appellant then gave an incriminating statement.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE TRIAL JUDGE’S REASONS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that there was no urgency in questioning the appellant
    that evening, but the appellant had had the opportunity to speak to counsel
    before turning himself in and he did so.  Constable Harris had made all reasonable
    efforts to contact the appellant’s counsel of choice and had no reason to
    believe that by waiting any longer, the appellant’s counsel would return
    his calls.  On the other hand, the appellant was eager to tell his story
    and was satisfied with the assurance that he would be able to contact his
    lawyer before the bail hearing.  The trial judge was not persuaded that the
    appellant “ever asserted right to counsel as a precondition for giving a
    statement”.  She continued as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I make the finding not on the basis of implied
    waiver by answering questions.  Rather, I find that knowing that he had the
    right to counsel before giving any statement, Mr. Connelly remained eager
    to tell his story and his assertion of the right to counsel was satisfied
    by the assurance that contact before the bail hearing could be accomplished.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    the appellant’s eagerness to talk, the trial judge found it was not reasonable
    to require Constable Harris to continue to insist that the appellant wait
    before telling his story.  The trial judge was satisfied that the appellant
    was not misled in any way by the officer as to his options for contacting
    counsel.  She concluded as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I find that Detective Constable Harris made reasonable
    attempts to obtain counsel of choice in the circumstances and that the option
    of duty counsel was reasonably offered.  Callum Connelly declined as he may.  His
    statement is admissible in the circumstances.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    this court said in <i>R. v. Badgerow</i> (2008), 237 C.C.C. (3d) 107, at
    para. 44, </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='line-height:normal;'>Where an accused asks to
    speak to a particular lawyer on arrest or detention, the police are obliged
    to give the accused a reasonable opportunity to exercise his or her right
    to counsel of choice and to hold off in questioning the accused so long as
    the accused is reasonably diligent in exercising the right.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further, “the
    police must be diligent in ensuring that an accused has a reasonable opportunity
    to exercise his or her rights, and may not rely on answers to ambiguous questions
    as a basis for assuming that an accused has exercised his or her rights”: <i>Badgerow</i>,
    at para. 46.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the appellant asked to speak to a particular lawyer.  As I understand
    her reasons, the trial judge found as a fact that the appellant wanted to
    speak to his lawyer, not to obtain advice before speaking to the police,
    but to ensure that she would be available for advice prior to his bail hearing
    the following day.  I have not been persuaded that this finding of fact is
    unreasonable.  In light of those findings, despite the very able submissions
    of duty counsel, Mr. Di Luca, who assisted the appellant, in my view, the
    appellant’s right to counsel was not violated.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    governing principle where a detainee asserts a right to consult with a particular
    counsel is set down in <i>R. v. Ross</i>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 3 at 10 – 11:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Although an accused or detained person has the
    right to choose counsel, it must be noted that, as this court said in R<i>.
    v. Tremblay</i>, [1987] 2 S.C.R. 435, a detainee must be reasonably diligent
    in the exercise of these rights and if he is not, the correlative duties
    imposed on the police and set out in <i>Manninen</i> [[1987] 1 S.C.R. 1233] are
    suspended. Reasonable diligence in the exercise of the right to choose one's
    counsel depends upon the context facing the accused or detained person. On
    being arrested, for example, the detained person is faced with an immediate
    need for legal advice and must exercise reasonable diligence accordingly.
    By contrast, when seeking the best lawyer to conduct a trial, the accused
    person faces no such immediacy. Nevertheless, <i>accused or detained persons
    have a right to choose their counsel and it is only if the lawyer chosen
    cannot be available in a reasonable time that the detainee or the accused
    should be expected to exercise the right to counsel by calling another lawyer</i>.  [Citation
    and emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, there was no urgency to proceeding with questioning of the appellant.
    The offence had been committed months earlier and the appellant was to be
    detained in custody pending the bail hearing the next day.  There was no
    suggestion that any investigative procedures had to be performed immediately.  The
    appellant was therefore entitled to attempt to obtain advice from Ms. McLeod,
    if he wanted, prior to being questioned by the police, provided she could
    be available within a reasonable time. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the appellant also had to exercise reasonable diligence in the exercise of
    his rights.  On the trial judge’s finding, the appellant was not interested
    in consulting counsel before speaking to Constable Harris.  There was evidence
    to support this finding.  Although the appellant initially asked to speak
    to counsel, he almost immediately wanted to know when the officer would speak
    to him.  It is particularly telling that the appellant then wanted to know
    what would happen if the officer could not get hold of his lawyer.  After
    the officer’s accurate response, the appellant asked what he should say if
    he thought he might have done it.  Again it appears that the appellant was
    more interested in talking to the officer than obtaining immediate advice
    from Ms.&nbsp;McLeod.  The trial judge was satisfied that the officer had
    not attempted to “fool him into answering questions”.  I take this as a finding
    that the police officer had not attempted to elicit evidence from the appellant.  While
    perhaps it would have been more prudent of the officer not to answer the
    appellant’s questions and to refrain from encouraging him to make a statement
    at that point in time, it was open to the trial judge to make the finding
    that the officer’s response was reasonable in the circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    as the trial judge pointed out, on several occasions when the appellant began
    to make inculpatory remarks, the officer stopped him, reminded him that he
    had asked to speak to his lawyer and made efforts to contact the lawyer.  Finally,
    it was the appellant, not Constable Harris, who steered the conversation
    towards bail.  Given the conversation that ensued between the officer and
    the appellant thereafter, it was open to the trial judge to find that the
    appellant’s interest in speaking to counsel of choice only related to bail.
    The appellant has not demonstrated that his s. 10(b) rights were violated.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>DISPOSITION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
