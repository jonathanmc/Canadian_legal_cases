style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant, Imperial Oil Limited (“Imperial”), appeals from the judgment of
    the Divisional Court dismissing its application for judicial review of that
    part of a final arbitral award which held that Imperial’s policy of random
    drug testing of certain employees, absent reasonable cause, violated the
    collective agreement (the “Collective Agreement”) at Imperial’s petroleum
    refinery in Nanticoke, Ontario.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Imperial
    argues that the Divisional Court erred: (i) by applying the patent unreasonableness
    standard of review to the arbitral award; and (ii) by failing to find that
    the board of arbitration erred (a) by relying on purported “facts” drawn
    from other proceedings and decisions that were not supported by the evidential
    record before the board; (b) by amending or failing to apply the Collective
    Agreement; and (c) by interpreting the Collective Agreement without proper
    regard to the <i>Human Rights Code</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.19 (the “Code”).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    the reasons that follow, I conclude that the appeal must be dismissed.</p>
  <h2>II.        Background</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    1992, Imperial introduced an alcohol and drug policy at its
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Nanticoke refinery that provided for random breathalyser alcohol testing
    and random urinalysis drug testing of employees in safety sensitive positions
    (the
    “Policy”).  The stated objectives of the Policy are as follows: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The objectives of this policy are: (i) to create
    a safe work environment by reducing the risk of incidents in which drugs
    or alcohol are a contributing factor; and (ii) to deter the use of alcohol,
    drugs and other substances where such use may negatively affect work performance
    and safety.  As a matter of policy [Imperial] expects that all employees
    will be free of alcohol or drugs which could impair their judgment or affect
    their ability to perform their job safely.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>No
    trade union or collective agreement was in place at the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Nanticoke facility when the Policy was implemented.  The Collective Agreement
    between Imperial and the respondent, the Communications, Energy &amp; Paperworkers
    Union of Canada, Local 900 (the “
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    Union”), was negotiated in 1996.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Collective Agreement contains a management rights clause.  Article 2.01 provides
    that Imperial has “the exclusive rights to manage and direct all aspects
    of the refinery operation and the work force”.  Under this clause, Imperial
    is empowered to discipline, suspend or terminate the employment of any employee
    for just cause and to make, enforce and alter work rules, among other matters.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    addition, under Article 3.02 of the Collective Agreement, the parties jointly
    committed “to a work place environment that is free of harassment and where
    individuals are treated with respect and dignity”.  Moreover, Article 19.01
    states:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It is agreed by both parties that emphasis shall
    be placed upon the need for safe and healthy working conditions and practices
    on [Imperial’s] premises.  [Imperial] shall continue to make provisions for
    the safety and health of its employees during the hours of employment.</p>
  <h2>(1)       First Challenge to the Policy </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    random alcohol and drug testing provisions of the Policy were challenged
    under the Code by an Imperial employee.  The ensuing board of inquiry hearing
    encompassed a review of all aspects of the Policy, including its random drug
    testing provisions.  The board of inquiry ultimately concluded that several
    aspects of the random alcohol and drug testing provisions of the Policy contravened
    the Code.  Imperial’s appeal to the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court from the board of inquiry’s decision was dismissed:  <i>Entrop
    v. Imperial Oil Ltd.</i> (1998), 35 C.C.E.L. (2d) 56 (
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Ont. Div. Ct.).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Imperial’s
    further appeal to this court was allowed in part.  In <i>Entrop v. Imperial
    Oil Ltd.</i> (2000), 50 O.R. (3d) 18 (<i>Entrop</i>), the board of inquiry’s
    finding that Imperial had developed and implemented the Policy honestly and
    in good faith was affirmed.  The court concluded, however, that the impugned
    alcohol and drug testing provisions of the Policy were <i>prima facie</i> discriminatory
    under the Code’s prohibition of discrimination based on handicap.  The court
    went on to hold that random breathalyser alcohol testing of employees in
    safety sensitive positions, where supervision was limited or non-existent,
    was a reasonable workplace requirement to achieve a work environment free
    of alcohol.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    court reached a different conclusion regarding the random urinalysis drug
    testing provisions of the Policy.  In the opinion of the court, these provisions
    could not be justified as reasonably necessary to accomplish Imperial’s legitimate
    goal of a safe workplace free of drug impairment since the drug testing in
    question could not measure on-the-job drug impairment but, rather, only past
    drug use.  A positive drug test under the Policy furnished no evidence of
    impairment or likely impairment on-the-job.  As a result, the court concluded
    that the random drug testing provisions of the Policy as they then existed
    violated the Code as they were not <i>bona fide</i> occupational requirements.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the aftermath of <i>Entrop</i>, Imperial continued random breathalyser alcohol
    testing, but stopped random urinalysis drug testing at the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Nanticoke refinery.  In accordance with <i>Entrop</i>, it amended the alcohol
    testing provisions of the Policy to provide for individualized assessment
    and employee-specific sanctions for employees who violated the alcohol-related
    provisions.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After <i>Entrop</i>,
    Imperial also embarked on an investigation of new drug testing technologies
    to identify a means by which on-the-job impairment from cannabis, rather
    than merely past drug use, could be detected.  Eventually, Imperial received
    expert advice that oral fluid (saliva) drug testing could show current impairment
    by cannabis.  Accordingly, effective July 2003, Imperial resumed random drug
    testing of safety sensitive employees, using oral fluid testing technology,
    at the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Nanticoke facility.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Under
    this drug testing method, oral fluid is collected by placing an absorbent
    pad in an individual’s mouth for about two minutes.  The oral fluid sample
    is then placed in a preservative solution, sealed, and sent to a laboratory
    for analysis.  Pursuant to Imperial’s Policy, the test results are communicated
    to identified individuals at the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Nanticoke refinery several days later.  Ultimately, management at the
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Nanticoke facility is informed only of positive drug test results.</p>
  <h2>(2)       Current Challenge to the Policy </h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    October 2003, the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Union grieved Imperial’s new form of drug testing.  Notwithstanding <i>Entrop</i>,
    the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    Union’s grievance also challenged Imperial’s random breathalyser testing
    for alcohol impairment, as well as other aspects of the Policy.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    board of arbitration comprised of Michel G. Picher (chair), John More (the
    Union’s nominee) and Roy C. Filion (Imperial’s nominee) (collectively, the “Board”),
    was appointed to consider the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    Union’s grievance.  The Board made two awards pertinent to the issues on
    appeal.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    by a preliminary award dated February 20, 2005, the Board unanimously held
    that the Union was precluded from challenging Imperial’s random breathalyser
    alcohol testing as the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Union did not file any grievance concerning this testing until 2003.  Since
    the Union had thereby acquiesced in Imperial’s longstanding alcohol impairment
    testing, the Board ruled that it would be inequitable for the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Union’s attack on that testing to proceed.  The
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    Union did not challenge this preliminary award.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    by a final award dated December 11, 2006, a majority of the Board – the chair
    and the Union’s nominee (the
    “Majority”) – allowed the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Union’s grievance concerning Imperial’s drug testing in part.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Majority upheld the “for cause” and post-incident drug testing provisions
    of the Policy.  It also upheld the Policy’s random drug testing measures
    where such testing formed part of a continuing contract of employment and
    the rehabilitation of an employee clearly identified as having “a problem
    of alcohol or drug use”.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>But
    the Majority also ruled that the Policy provisions regarding the random drug
    testing of employees, absent reasonable cause, violated the terms of the
    Collective Agreement, with the result that they were null and void.  This
    is the ruling at issue on this appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Imperial’s
    nominee on the Board delivered a partial dissent.  While he agreed with the
    Majority that Imperial could “legitimately utilize drug testing in post-accident
    or post-incident situations”, he also held that the random drug testing provisions
    of the Policy that were not based on reasonable cause were permissible under
    the Collective Agreement.  In his opinion, the Policy provisions concerning
    random drug testing for impairment by cannabis using oral fluid testing represented “a
    reasonable and appropriate means of reducing risk and promoting workplace
    safety”, acted as an effective deterrent, did not contravene the Code, and
    were not inconsistent with the terms of the Collective Agreement or the provisions
    of the Code.  Accordingly, Imperial’s nominee would have dismissed the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Union’s grievance in its entirety.</p>

    aspect of the

    Divisional Court’s standard of review analysis was correct.  The courts have
    clearly determined that the decisions of labour arbitrators on interpretive

    from a reviewing court: see <i>Canadian General – Tower Ltd. v. United Steel,

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    task of a reviewing court under the reasonableness standard of analysis was
    explained by the majority in <i>Dunsmuir</i>, at para. 47, in this fashion:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A court conducting a review for reasonableness inquires
    into the qualities that make a decision reasonable, referring both to the
    process of articulating the reasons and to outcomes.  In judicial review,
    reasonableness is concerned mostly with the existence of justification, transparency
    and intelligibility within the decision-making process.  But it is also concerned
    with whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes
    which are defensible in respect of the facts and law.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    light of <i>Dunsmuir</i>, the parties accept that the reasonableness standard
    applies to judicial review of the Board’s final award.  It also applies where
    a board of arbitration determines its jurisdiction by interpreting a collective
    agreement.  However, Imperial argues that the application of this standard
    in this case is subject to two qualifications.  First, it submits that the
    correctness standard of review continues to apply where a labour board of
    arbitration exceeds its jurisdiction by amending, rather than applying, the
    collective agreement at issue – as Imperial alleges occurred in this case.  I
    agree: see <i>Dunsmuir</i>, at para. 59; <i>Hamilton (City) v. Canadian Union
    of Public Employees, Local 167</i> (1997), 33 O.R. (3d) 5 (

    also submits that questions regarding hearing fairness do not involve standard
    of review considerations.  Again, I agree.  Where the grounds of review concern
    the fairness of the proceeding at issue, including a party’s rights to natural
    justice, an assessment of the appropriate standard of review is neither appropriate
    nor required: see <i>Ontario v. Crown Employees Grievance Settlement Board</i> (2006),
    81 O.R. (3d) 419 (
    <st1:place

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this case, the application of these principles means that the Board’s final
    award is generally subject to review on the reasonableness standard.  A different
    standard applies to the issue whether the Majority exceeded its jurisdiction
    by amending or failing to apply the Collective Agreement.  In my opinion,
    as this question concerns the parameters of the Board’s jurisdiction, it
    attracts review on the correctness, rather than the reasonableness, standard.  Finally,
    Imperial’s claim that the Majority erred by relying on facts not established
    by the evidential record rests on the contention that hearing fairness was
    compromised.  Standard of review considerations are not implicated in the
    determination of that issue.  I did not understand the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Union to argue otherwise.  </p>

    argues that the Divisional Court erred by failing to find that the Majority
    improperly relied on facts drawn from other proceedings and decisions that
    were not established by the evidential record before the Board.  As a result,
    Imperial submits, hearing fairness was fatally compromised as the factual
    findings at issue are not supported by the evidence and Imperial was denied
    the opportunity to be informed of and to make representations about those
    findings.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    support of this argument, Imperial points especially to the following passages
    from the Majority’s reasons:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[104] As the cases would indicate, the “Canadian
    model” has gained broad acceptance within safety sensitive industries in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  The reported jurisprudence is devoid of any serious incidents or accidents
    attributed to workplace drug use.  That would suggest, as a general rule,
    that the balancing of interests approach evolved by Canadian arbitrators
    has been an appropriate, measured and ultimately effective response in balancing
    the rights of employers and employees in this sensitive area.  While it is
    obviously for each employer to decide which course it feels is appropriate
    for its enterprise, the fact remains that a significant number of major employers
    in highly safety sensitive industries in Canada have founded their alcohol
    and drug testing policies on principles of reasonable cause and have not
    attempted to force upon their employees mandatory, random, unannounced drug
    testing.  To the extent that those employers and industries have functioned
    well and have operated safely without apparent difficulty by holding to reasonable
    grounds as the basis for demanding a drug test, there is little reason to
    conclude that random, unannounced drug testing of all employees is, of necessity,
    an essential element for a successful alcohol and drug policy.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>….</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[122] That balancing must also be done against the
    back-ground of the extensive industrial relations experience of close to
    twenty years in Canada.  That experience, revealed in the cases cited, demonstrates
    the success of the established Canadian model for alcohol and drug testing
    in a safety sensitive workplace.  As reflected in the arbitral jurisprudence
    that system, readily accepted by employers such as CN, Dupont and Irving,
    appears to have allowed major industrial employers to achieve their safety
    goals without imposing random unannounced alcohol or drug testing on their
    safety sensitive employees.  The success of those employers, achieved in
    equally safety sensitive industries without recourse to random drug testing,
    seriously questions the credibility of the argument of counsel for [Imperial]
    suggesting that past random testing is responsible for the absence of drug
    related incidents in the refinery.  In the final analysis, in balancing the
    interests of the parties, a question to be considered is not merely whether
    the extreme approach of random drug testing for all employees is effective,
    but also whether it is necessary or justified.  The experience of other employers
    in a variety of safety sensitive industries would appear to suggest that
    it is not.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>….</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[126] In our view, given the wide acceptance of
    the established arbitral jurisprudence, at this point in time it would require
    clear and unequivocal contractual language to cause a board of arbitration
    to conclude that employees, through their union, have consented to random
    and speculative drug testing of their bodily fluids at the will of their
    employer.  That is clearly not the case on the evidence before us.</p>

    complains that these passages include several factual findings by the Majority
    that are not supported by the evidential record.  For example, it asserts
    that no evidence was led before the Board concerning: (i) the content of
    other industrial employers’ alcohol and drug testing policies; (ii) the asserted “[ready]
    acceptance” by those employers of the “Canadian model” for alcohol and drug
    testing and the suggested “success” of that model in safety sensitive workplaces;
    (iii) the relationship of those employers with their employees; and (iv)
    the extent to which such employers have “functioned well”, “operated safely
    without apparent difficulty” and “achieve[d] their safety goals” without
    resort to random drug testing absent reasonable cause.</p>

    of arbitration, like other tribunals and, indeed, the courts, are required
    to base their findings of fact exclusively on evidence that is admissible

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Accordingly, <i>apart from agreed statements of

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>During
    the Board hearing, both parties referred to and relied on a large number
    of prior Canadian arbitral decisions concerning alcohol and drug testing
    in the workplace.  It appears to have been uncontested that these decisions
    formed the backdrop for the Board’s consideration of the issues in dispute.  Many
    of the arbitration cases cited by the parties addressed such matters as random
    alcohol or drug testing of employees based on reasonable cause; the usefulness
    of random or pre-incident testing as a deterrent to the occurrence of workplace
    accidents; the use of random testing in safety-conscious industries in Canada;
    and the relationship between the prevalence of drug use in industrial workplaces
    and the incidence of workplace accidents.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    these circumstances, neither party could have been taken by surprise by the
    Majority’s detailed consideration of the cited arbitral jurisprudence or
    by its analysis of that jurisprudence in light of the arguments advanced.  The
    Majority’s lengthy reasons (72 pages) contain a detailed description of the
    evidence adduced at the hearing by both parties and a summary of the parties’ positions
    on the issues before the Board.  As part of this summary, the Majority reviewed
    many of the arbitral authorities supplied by the parties, as well as <i>Entrop</i>,
    and the parties’ positions in respect of those authorities.  Later in its
    reasons, when analyzing the issues before it, the Majority again examined
    numerous arbitration cases cited by the parties, together with this court’s
    decision in <i>Entrop</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>No
    transcript of the Board hearing is available.  However, we have received
    and reviewed the parties’
    final written submissions and the arbitral caselaw provided to the Board.  The
    parties’ submissions contain extensive references to the arbitration cases
    that the parties claimed were relevant to the issues before the Board, including
    those involving other industrial employers – <i>e.g.</i>, CN, Dupont and
    Irving – mentioned by the Majority in its reasons.   I note, in particular,
    that the written outline of the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Union’s final submissions consists almost entirely of a serial review of <i>Entrop</i> and
    prior arbitral decisions including, in virtually every instance, references

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span

    both parties had a full opportunity to make and did make those submissions
    to the Board that they thought advisable concerning the arbitral decisions
    that they furnished to the Board.  In particular, Imperial was aware of and
    had full opportunity to make representations on the cases that the parties
    themselves had identified as relevant, including submissions as to whether
    those cases were factually distinguishable or similar to the case before
    the Board and on the overall import of this established body of arbitral
    jurisprudence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    is not a case where the Board, unbeknownst to the parties, gathered evidence
    itself, or received evidence from one party in the absence of the other.  It
    was common ground that the decisions of other boards of arbitration, as identified
    by the parties, bore directly on the Board’s consideration of Imperial’s
    drug testing measures.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    and importantly, Imperial resisted the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Union’s grievance and defended the random drug testing provisions of the
    Policy in part on the basis that such testing is an effective means of deterring
    workplace behaviour that causes injury.  In its final written submissions
    to the Board, Imperial emphasized deterrence theory, its objective under
    the Policy of deterring drug use in order to promote workplace safety, the
    expert evidence before the Board of reduced drug use in workplaces in the
    United States following the introduction of mandatory, random drug testing,
    and the inadequacy of peer detection of drug impairment as an effective drug
    use deterrent in the workplace.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Many
    of the Majority’s challenged remarks are directly responsive to Imperial’s
    claim that random drug testing was necessary to achieve general deterrence
    of workplace drug use.  The Divisional Court therefore correctly observed
    that the Majority: “[drew] the material relied upon from the decided arbitration
    cases … upon which the parties had made submissions, and [used] it in reply
    to certain of [Imperial’s] submissions”.  To the extent that the arbitration
    cases proferred by the parties provided a counterpoint to or undercut Imperial’s
    general deterrence justification for random drug testing, it was open to
    the Board to resort to the relevant features of those cases for that purpose.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Imperial’s
    real complaint is that the Majority
    “crossed the line” from permissible to impermissible use of the arbitration
    cases in question by extracting and using some of the facts of those cases
    as part of the factual underpinning for its conclusions in this case. </p>

    appreciation of the factual and legal framework in play in the arbitration
    cases supplied by the parties.  I also see the comments in question as indicative
    of the Majority’s attempt to synthesize the underlying basis for the approach
    taken by other arbitrators to random alcohol or drug testing, as revealed
    by the arbitration cases cited to the Board.  That these were the Board’s
    purposes is supported by the Majority’s references, in the passages from
    its reasons relied on by Imperial and cited above, to “<i>the reported jurisprudence</i> [being]
    devoid of any serious incidents or accidents attributed to workplace drug
    use”; the lengthy Canadian industrial relations experience “<i>revealed in
    the cases cited</i>”; and the acceptance of the “established Canadian model” for
    alcohol and drug testing “<i>as reflected in the arbitral jurisprudence</i>” (emphasis

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

    said, certain of the wording in the impugned passages from the Majority’s
    reasons is susceptible to misinterpretation.  It would have been preferable,
    for example, had the Majority expressly indicated that its comments reflected
    its interpretation of the arbitration cases that it had reviewed and confirmed
    that its ultimate conclusion on the random drug testing provisions of the
    Policy, while informed by this arbitral jurisprudence, was based solely on
    the evidence adduced before it.  </p>

    the comments in question must be understood in the context of a relatively
    lengthy hearing in which both sides placed considerable reliance on and made
    extensive submissions about an established body of arbitral caselaw that
    directly concerned the subject matter of the Board hearing – random drug
    testing in the workplace.  In that context, it is unremarkable, and certainly
    not surprising, that the Majority would elaborate on its interpretation of
    that caselaw, including its view of the conclusions to be drawn from it,
    in its reasons.  In my opinion, fairly read, the Majority’s reasons reveal
    that it did no more.  </p>

    am fortified in this conclusion by the dissent of Imperial’s nominee.  Nowhere
    in his lengthy dissent does he voice any concern that the Majority relied
    in its reasons on facts not established in evidence before it or in respect
    of which the parties would be taken by surprise.  Nor did he assert that
    hearing fairness had been compromised, or that a breach of natural justice
    had occurred.  If any of these signal events had arguably transpired, it
    is highly likely that this experienced labour relations lawyer would have
    voiced this crucial complaint in his objections to the Majority’s decision.  He
    did not do so.</p>

    this court, Imperial renews its argument that the Majority breached Article

    alcohol and drug testing in a safety sensitive workplace.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Imperial’s
    argument proceeds in this fashion.  It submits that the “Canadian model” has
    no application in this case for two main reasons.  First, the “Canadian model” prohibits
    random testing for impairment both by alcohol and drugs unless such testing
    is expressly and clearly negotiated by the parties to a collective agreement.  In
    contrast, as affirmed by the Board’s preliminary award and <i>Entrop</i>,
    the Policy at issue here permits random testing for alcohol impairment, although
    such testing was not negotiated between the parties.  Second, the type of
    random drug testing at issue under the “Canadian model” – drug testing by
    urinalysis – cannot detect on-the-job drug impairment.  On the other hand,
    Imperial contends, the random oral fluid drug testing envisaged by the Policy
    is analogous to random breathalyser alcohol testing since it allows for detection
    of on-the-job drug impairment, albeit with delayed reporting of test results.  Accordingly,
    as Imperial’s Policy is therefore inconsistent with the “Canadian model” in
    these important respects, the Majority erred by relying on this model, in
    effect, to impose “an alien scheme” on the parties to the Collective Agreement.  This
    was tantamount, Imperial says, to improperly amending the Collective Agreement
    or failing to apply it in accordance with its terms.</p>

    <st1:Street w:st="on">

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>There is no express language in the collective agreement

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In its award on the merits, the Board considered

    – the “Canadian model”.  It applied the balancing of interests test from
    that jurisprudence and weighed [Imperial’s] interest in providing a safe

    in my opinion, the Majority did not conceive the concept of a “Canadian model” as
    a means of formulating and imposing a new scheme for drug testing on the
    parties.  The expression, the “Canadian model”, appears to have first been
    used by another arbitrator in a 2004 arbitral award as a convenient short-hand
    reference to a best practices model for alcohol and drug policies in the
    Alberta construction industry: see <i>Re Construction Labour Relations and
    International Union of Operating Engineers, Local 955</i> (2004), 129 L.A.C.

style='"Times New Roman"'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this case, the Majority defined the term
    “Canadian model” in its reasons with reference to the existing arbitral jurisprudence
    in the area of alcohol and drug testing in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    (paras. 101-104).  In particular, the Majority indicated that a key feature
    of this jurisprudence is “that arbitrators have overwhelmingly rejected mandatory,
    random and unannounced drug testing for all employees in a safety sensitive
    workplace as being an implied right of management under the terms of a collective
    agreement” (para. 101).  Thus, it was in the context of examining the established
    Canadian arbitral jurisprudence concerning workplace alcohol and drug testing
    and in attempting to summarize the nature of that jurisprudence that the
    Majority employed the term “Canadian model”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>  The
    Majority commenced its analysis of the random drug testing provisions of
    the Policy with what it described as a brief review of “the evolution of
    Canadian arbitral jurisprudence with respect to the right of an employer,
    in a safety sensitive industry, to demand that an employee undergo a drug
    test” (para. 91).  The Majority next considered the numerous arbitration
    cases furnished by the parties that addressed random alcohol or drug testing
    by employers, and pointed out that those cases supported reasonable cause
    based – rather than random – drug testing in the workplace.  The Majority
    then stated:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[98] It is fair to say that <i>over time the arbitral
      jurisprudence in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place

    has developed relatively clear lines as to what constitutes an acceptable
    drug and alcohol testing policy in a safety sensitive workplace which is
    governed by a collective bargaining regime</i>.  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[99] <i>The foregoing jurisprudence has come to
      be viewed as tantamount to a Canadian code for drug testing in a safety
      sensitive workplace governed by collective bargaining</i>, the regime by
      which terms and conditions of employment must be negotiated between employers
      and unions.  They have become widely accepted and applied.  <i>Indeed,
      the drug testing policies and limitations fashioned within that jurisprudence
      came to be recognized as the “Canadian model” as adopted in the construction
      industry in

    Majority went on to describe some of the key elements of this “Canadian model
    for alcohol or drug testing in a safety sensitive workplace as developed
    in the arbitral jurisprudence” (para. 100).  Imperial does not suggest that
    this description was inaccurate.</p>

    structure and content of this part of the Majority’s reasons reveal that
    its references to the “Canadian model” were intended to capture, in a summary
    fashion, its interpretation of the holdings in the existing arbitration cases
    on the issue of alcohol and drug testing in a variety of Canadian workplaces.  There
    is nothing objectionable in this approach.  It confirms that the Majority
    used the prior arbitral decisions on drug and alcohol testing as a comparative
    aid to its interpretation of the Collective Agreement and the Policy, by
    contrasting the latter to the alcohol and drug testing measures of other
    employers as recorded in the cited Canadian arbitral jurisprudence.</p>

    to Imperial’s submission, this does not mean that the Majority failed to

    fact that Imperial’s Policy, in contrast to the testing policies of other

    and centre to the entire hearing before the Board.  The Majority’s reasons
    afford no evidence that it somehow lost sight of this important factor when
    analyzing the provisions of the Policy and the Collective Agreement.  On
    the contrary, the Majority expressly recognized that the Board’s preliminary
    award and an earlier arbitration case in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Alberta had both addressed Imperial’s right to conduct random breathalyser

    the Majority was alert to Imperial’s contention that its random oral fluid
    drug testing was analogous to the random alcohol breathalyser testing approved
    in <i>Entrop</i>.  As it was entitled to do, the Majority considered, and
    rejected, this contention on the basis of the evidence before it that oral
    fluid drug testing in fact did not permit immediate detection of drug impairment
    on-the-job (paras. 64 and 112-113).</p>

    essentially argues that the Majority erred by improperly grafting onto its

    “Canadian model” for drug testing, when that model differed from and had
    no relevance to consideration of Imperial’s Policy, without recognizing or

    Majority held that, absent contractual or statutory consent or reasonable
    cause to conduct a drug test, random drug testing under the Policy violated
    Imperial’s contrac-tual commitment under Article 3.02 of the Collective Agreement
    to treat individuals in the workplace with
    “respect and dignity”.  In the view of the Majority, “[f]ailing to accord
    such respect goes to the dignity of the person” (para. 126).</p>

    Majority further held that, Article 3.02 aside, such drug testing could not
    be justified “on a responsible application of the balancing of interests
    approach in a safety sensitive environment that has carefully evolved over
    the decades within the arbitral jurisprudence in Canada” (para. 126).  The
    Majority noted that Imperial’s own record of work at the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Nanticoke refinery did not include even “one substantiated case of an employee
    working impaired by reason of the consumption of a drug” (para. 127).  Moreover,
    there was no “significant evidence of drug use generally within the workforce
    away from work, or within the surrounding community” (para. 127).  The Majority
    therefore concluded that Imperial’s random drug testing, absent reasonable
    cause, was not justified, and constituted “an unwarranted intrusion on [employees’]
    privacy” and “an unjustifiable affront to their dignity” (para. 127).  </p>

    Divisional Court, Article 3.02 makes no mention of the Code.  Nor is the
    Code mentioned elsewhere in the Collective Agreement.  There is no dispute,

    agree with the Union’s submission that on a plain reading of the unqualified
    language of Article 3.02, there is no basis to conclude that Imperial’s contractual
    obligation to treat its employees with respect and dignity is limited to
    the minimum standards for the protection of human rights embodied in the
    Code.  On the contrary, the wide cast of Article 3.02 is inconsistent with
    the notion that the parties intended to deal under that clause with only
    the forms of discrimination prohibited by the Code.</p>

    the Majority provided several cogent reasons for its holding that the random
    drug testing measures at issue offended Article 3.02.  These included: (i)
    the method and timing of the random drug tests, which the Majority found
    do not permit the immediate detection of impairment from cannabis at the
    time of testing but, rather, only after the passage of the several days required
    for analysis of the test specimen and reporting of the test results; (ii)
    Imperial’s obligation to respect an employee’s expectation of privacy absent
    consent to or reasonable cause for a random drug test; and (iii) the fact
    that this court’s decision in <i>Entrop</i> did not assist on the issue of
    the scope of Article 3.02 since <i>Entrop</i> did not involve the interpretation
    or the application of the Collective Agreement.  The Majority’s reasons on
    this issue are clear and intelligible.  They provide ample justification
    for its conclusion that Imperial’s random drug testing, absent reasonable
    cause, offended Article 3.02.</p>

    reason-able within the meaning of <i>Dunsmuir</i>.  Given this conclusion,
    it is unnecessary to address the Majority’s alternate holding that, regardless
    of Article 3.02, the random drug testing provisions of the Policy, absent
    reasonable cause, cannot be justified under the Collective Agreement without
    clear and unequivocal contractual language signifying employee consent to
    such testing measures.</p>
