      involves a claim by the lawyer for one party in a matrimonial litigation
      to recover her fees and disbursements from both her client and the opposite
      party.  The appellant represented the respondent Julie Crossen in a hotly
      contested matrimonial proceeding against the other respondent, Nikolaos
      Mirkopoulos.  The appellant claimed the sum of $217,773.24 for unpaid fees
      and disbursements.  Crossen terminated the appellant’s retainer and reached
      a settlement agreement with Mirkopoulos without any input from the appellant.  That
      settlement agreement provided that the parties would each be responsible
      for their own legal costs.  The appellant brought this action to recover
      the amount of her account from both Crossen and Mirkopoulos, alleging that
      the two had colluded with each other to prevent Garfin from recovering
      her fees. </span></p>

      trial judge dismissed the collusion claim but held that Mirkopoulos was
      liable for the appellant’s account in contract on the basis that Mirkopoulos
      had promised Crossen that he would pay it.  The trial judge also found,
      however, that the fees claimed were excessive and reduced the appellant’s
      account to $50,000.</span></p>

      appellant seeks no relief in this court against Crossen but appeals the
      reduction of the bill as against Mirkopoulos.  Mirkopoulos cross-appeals
      the finding that he is liable for the appellant’s account in contract.  The
      appellant submits that if the contract finding is set aside, she is entitled
      to recover on the basis of collusion. </span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Crossen
      met Mirkopoulos, a man of considerable financial means, in 1998 when she
      was 25 and he was 57.  The trial judge found that they began to live together
      in April 2001 and that they were married in July 2001.  Crossen complained
      that Mirkopoulos assaulted her, and they separated in August 2002.  Lengthy
      and acrimonious matrimonial litigation ensued.  The appellant represented
      Crossen in that litigation for more than four years.  Crossen suffered
      health problems and was a difficult client.  There were many pretrial motions
      and case conferences on issues of disclosure and interim support.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant secured a favorable interim support order for Crossen of $4,000
      per month.  The matter was set down for trial, scheduled to begin in May
      2007.  In February 2007, Crossen suggested to Mirkopoulos that they meet
      with a view to settling the litigation.  At the time, Crossen’s support
      order was being garnished for outstanding costs orders in favour of Mirkopoulos’ two
      brothers, who had been parties in related proceedings, and she was unable
      to get in touch with the appellant in order to deal with this matter.  Crossen
      testified that Mirkopoulos encouraged her to terminate the appellant’s
      retainer.  Mirkopoulos denied that he had done so.  In any event, Crossen
      did terminate the appellant’s retainer in early March 2007.  Following
      an unsuccessful mediation, Crossen and Mirkopoulos attended a trial management
      conference on March 30, 2007 and executed a separation agreement settling
      the litigation.  Crossen was unrepresented at the time, while Mirkopoulos
      was advised by counsel who drafted the agreement.  The agreement provided
      for a final, one time support payment to Crossen of $33,000 and provided
      that the parties would each be responsible for their own legal fees.</span></p>

      the time of the termination of the retainer, the appellant’s unpaid account
      was for $217,773.24.  The appellant had already received approximately
      $58,000 for legal fees during the course of the litigation from interim
      payments made by Mirkopoulos to Crossen.</span></p>

      will consider the issues raised in both the appeal and cross-appeal in
      the following order:</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-US>1.   Did the trial judge err by finding Mirkopoulos liable
      to the appellant in contract?</span></p>
  <p><span lang=EN-US>2.   Did the trial judge err by rejecting the claim against
      Mirkopoulos based on collusion?</span></p>

      account to $50,000?</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge found that “it was always Mr. Mirkopoulos’ intention that he
      would pay Ms. Garfin’s account after it was assessed” (para. 57) and that “Mr.
      Mirkopoulos always took the position that he would contribute to Ms. Garfin’s
      legal fees after they were assessed” (para. 62).  The trial judge did not
      explain the evidence she relied upon to find that Mirkopoulos had agreed
      with Crossen that he would pay the appellant’s account. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>For
      the following reasons, I conclude that the evidence is simply not capable
      of supporting the trial judge’s finding of an agreement by Mirkopoulos
      to pay the appellant’s account, and further that as the appellant did not
      plead a claim in contract, the issue was not properly addressed at the
      trial. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
      turn first to the evidence relied upon by the appellant to support the
      trial judge’s finding. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We
      were referred to Crossen’s examination for discovery where she stated that
      she was “under the understanding that [Mirkopoulos], after looking after
      the bills with [his counsel], was going to be taking care of [the appellant’s]
      bills, after it was assessed.” Crossen further stated: “we made an agreement
      that he would take care of [the appellant], and it wasn’t to come out of
      my lousy $32,000”.  The appellant cross-examined Crossen on her discovery
      transcript at great length but did not put these passages to her.  However,
      in an attempt to bring the lengthy cross-examination to an end, Mirkopoulos’ counsel
      agreed that the appellant could simply file the transcript as an exhibit. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      only trial evidence cited by the appellant to support the finding are portions
      of Crossen’s cross-examination at trial where she testified that Mirkopoulos “never
      said he would not pay” the appellant’s account. Crossen also testified
      that she was concerned about how the account would be paid and that she
      did not want to leave the appellant out in the cold.  She believed that
      Mirkopoulos would pay the account after it was assessed:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>…and all I believe Mr. Mirkopoulos
      wanted was to be able to assess the bill properly and maybe make some type
      of settlement to her that wasn’t so outrageous because, you know, it would
      benefit everybody to just get on with their lives if we could do that,
      and it just didn’t seem to ever go for some reason.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      my view, the evidence relied on by the appellant, taken at its highest,
      shows that Crossen hoped or perhaps assumed that Mirkopoulos would pay
      the account once it was assessed.  The fact that Markopoulos indicated
      during the various settlement discussions that the account would have to
      be assessed does not amount to an agreement by him to pay the account.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There
      is nothing in Mirkopoulos’ own evidence that would support a finding that
      he agreed to pay the appellant’s account.  Indeed, the appellant never
      put the allegation of an agreement to pay the account to him in cross-examination.  When
      asked if Crossen mentioned anything about legal fees at the time the settlement
      agreement was concluded, Mirkopoulos testified that Crossen had mentioned
      that she had received a large bill despite that fact that the appellant
      had been deducting fees every month from her support payments.  Mirkopoulos
      testified that he told Crossen: “Julie, I don’t want to know.  I got enough
      in my head.”  When asked if Crossen made any effort to persuade him to
      pay the account, he testified that he told her that he saw no consistency
      in the three or four accounts and that it was his opinion that the appellant
      had been totally paid by the money she had deducted from Crossen’s support
      payments. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There
      was unequivocal evidence from the mediator, found by the trial judge to
      be a reliable witness, that Mirkopoulos flatly rejected the suggestion
      that he pay or contribute to the appellants account as part of the settlement.  Finally,
      the settlement agreement could not be clearer: it specifically provides
      that the parties will be responsible for their own costs.  This evidence,
      which the trial judge did not consider in her reasons, completely undermines
      her findings that “it was always Mr. Mirkopoulos’ intention that he would
      pay Ms. Garfin’s account after it was assessed” and that “Mr. Mirkopoulos
      always took the position that he would contribute to Ms. Garfin’s legal
      fees after they were assessed.” </span></p>

      doubt an important reason for the lack of evidence on the agreement is
      that the issue was not pleaded or argued.  The statement of claim advances

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>While
      the claim states in a conclusory manner that Mirkopoulos is liable for
      breach of contract, it does not plead facts that are capable of explaining
      how or why Mirkopoulos is liable for any contractual breach and there is
      certainly no allegation of an agreement to pay the account made in the
      statement of claim.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant argues that since Mirkopoulos admitted that he knew about the
      outstanding legal fees and Crossen’s financial status, the only probable
      defence to the collusion claim was that Mirkopoulos had agreed to pay Garfin’s
      fees.  Accordingly, it was necessary for Mirkopoulos to adduce evidence
      on this issue in any event, and so the failure of the statement of claim
      to plead the contract does not result in any trial unfairness.  The appellant’s
      submission on this point rests upon the untenable proposition that Mirkopoulos
      defeated the collusion claim by establishing that he agreed to pay the
      appellant’s account.  That is simply not what happened at this trial.  Mirkopoulos
      did not defeat the collusion claim by advancing an agreement.  As I have
      already noted, the subject of an agreement simply did not come up when
      he gave his evidence. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Because
      the appellant did not plead that Mirkopoulos agreed with Crossen that he
      would pay the appellant’s legal fees, Mirkopoulos could not be expected
      to know that he should be prepared to meet that allegation.  The trial
      judge erred in awarding judgment against him on a ground not pleaded and
      not litigated at trial.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>It
      has been repeatedly held was held that it is inappropriate for a case to
      be decided on an issue not identified by the parties in the pleadings and
      dealt with at trial: see e.g. <i>TSP-INTL Ltd. v. Mills</i> (2006), 81
      O.R. (3d) 266 (C.A.), at para. 35: </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The difficulty here is that the
      parties did not frame their lawsuit or conduct the trial on these bases.  In
      the context of the case, the defendants were effectively deprived of knowing
      the case they had to meet, and of any opportunity to meet that case throughout
      the trial.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
      conclude, accordingly, that the agreement upon which the trial judge based
      her finding of liability against Mirkopoulos was not pleaded and that the
      parties simply did not join issue on any such alleged agreement at trial.  In
      any event, the evidence does not support the trial judge’s finding.  Accordingly,
      I would allow also the cross-appeal and dismiss the claim against Mirkopoulos.</span></p>

      add that even if we were to uphold the finding that Mirkopoulos agreed
      with Crossen to pay the appellant’s account, I fail to see how in law such
      an agreement would make Mirkopoulos liable to the appellant.  The appellant’s
      contractual rights were against her client Crossen.  An agreement between
      Crossen and Mirkopoulos would allow Crossen to claim over against Mirkopoulos
      if and when sued by the appellant, but would not permit the appellant to
      sue Mirkopoulos directly.</span></p>

      only argument advanced in support of the contention that the appellant
      could sue on the agreement was that Crossen was acting as the appellant’s
      agent when she made the alleged contract with Mirkopoulos.  I would reject
      that argument.  It was not advanced at trial and there is simply no evidence
      to support it.  In particular, there is nothing in the record to show that
      the purported agreement was made for the appellant’s benefit; that Crossen
      was acting as Garfin’s agent or that she had any authority to do so: see <i>Dyck

      the present case, denying the appellant the right to sue on the purported
      contract between Crossen and Mirkopoulos would stand in the way of neither
      commercial reality nor justice.  There is nothing to indicate that the
      purported agreement was intended to confer rights on the appellant as against
      Mirkopoulos, or that Mirkopoulos agreed or intended to enter into any kind
      of arrangement for the benefit of the appellant.  The appellant certainly
      could not have relied on the purported agreement, as it was only entered
      into after her services had been performed and her fees had been incurred.  She
      provided legal services to Crossen with full knowledge of Crossen’s financial
      circumstances.  While the appellant no doubt hoped to secure a judgment
      or settlement in Crossen’s favour that would have required Mirkopoulos
      to indemnify Crossen for all or part of her legal costs, the appellant
      could not have had any expectation that she could look directly to Mirkopoulos
      for payment of her account. </span></p>

      trial judge found that the claims for fraud, collusion and conspiracy had
      not been made out.  Her factual findings on these points are not challenged
      on appeal.  The appellant argues, however, that a claim for collusion was
      made out on the facts that were proven, namely that (i) both Crossen and
      Mirkopoulos knew of the appellant’s outstanding account, and (ii) the settlement
      agreement between Crossen and Mirkopoulos resolving their dispute failed
      to provide for the payment of that account.  The appellant submits that
      liability for collusion is made out if the <i>effect </i>of the agreement
      was to deprive the appellant of the means to recover her account.</span></p>

      disagree with that submission.  The ingredients of collusion where dealt
      with by this court in <i>Gardiner Miller Arnold LLP v. Kymbo International
      Inc</i>. (2007), 33 B.L.R. (4th) 34.  The court held, at para. 26, that
      collusion requires a finding that “there was an agreement between (the
      parties) to deprive (the law firm) of the fees to which it was entitled”.  This
      requires that one of the <i>purposes</i> of the agreement must have been
      to defeat the law firm’s claims (paras. 40-51).  <i>Gardiner </i>involved
      a secret deal whereby a client received monies that would not be disclosed
      to anybody, including his solicitors. Lang J.A., writing for the court,
      concluded that the object of the secret payment was to defeat the solicitor’s
      claim and stated, at para. 56: “[i]t simply makes no sense for the [third
      party] to conceal its payment to [the client] unless it did so for the
      purpose of defeating [the solicitor’s] claim.” </span></p>

      where Denman J. described collusion as “an agreement between two parties
      with the knowledge that they are doing an unfair thing in depriving a third
      party of a right he had.”  In that case there was evidence that the client
      had entered negotiations with the opposite side to settle litigation with
      a view to getting better terms for himself and his opponent by way of an
      arrangement that would cut out his solicitor.  The circumstances were described
      as follows by Wills J., at p. 769:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>It is obvious that if the plaintiff’s
      solicitor’s costs could be got rid of, better terms could be obtained by
      the defendant, and the bargain was made with that object.  Both the plaintiff
      and the solicitors for the defendant were well aware that a considerable
      sum for costs was due, and their conduct shows that they desired to defeat
      the applicant’s claim for them.  The defendant’s solicitors knew that they
      could get better terms for their client from the plaintiff if he left his
      solicitor out in the cold.</span></p>

    is made out where the court is satisfied that the <i>object</i> <i>or purpose</i> of
    the agreement was to deprive the solicitor of his fees.  In that case, going
    behind the backs of both his own solicitor and that of the plaintiff, the

      pay his solicitors.  He was ready to assist the plaintiff to leave the

      my view, the appellant’s submission that collusion was made out merely
      by showing that the settlement that Crossen and Mirkopoulos reached failed
      to provide for the payment of the appellant’s account cannot be accepted.  That
      submission is not supported by the authorities to which I have referred
      and I see no reason in the circumstances of this case to relax the test
      for collusion that is set out in those cases.  Here, Crossen, the weaker
      party, initiated the settlement discussions.  This was not a secret or
      back door arrangement designed to leave the appellant out in the cold but
      rather a settlement reached at a judge-supervised settlement conference.  Crossen
      testified that she raised the matter of the appellant’s account with the
      judge who conducted the settlement conference and was told “that is something
      the lawyer will obviously take care of and it will come up against me.”</span></p>

      was clearly open to Mirkopoulos to say that he would pay $33,000 to settle
      the case and no more and to leave the matter of the appellant’s account
      to be dealt with as between Crossen and the appellant.  His solicitor testified
      at trial that it was his opinion that given the very short duration of
      the marriage, Mirkopoulos had already overpaid Crossen in support and owed
      her nothing by way of equalization.  In view of that legal advice, it is
      difficult to see how the manner in which Mirkopoulos settled the litigation
      could be described as collusive.  I also agree with the submission made
      by counsel for Mirkopoulos that if the appellant’s submission were accepted,
      the effect would be to force impecunious litigants to reject any settlement
      that did not cover their legal costs. </span></p>
