  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    principal question on this appeal is whether the police had reasonable and
    probable grounds to arrest the appellant.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    parties do not dispute the facts.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    police intercepted a package addressed to “K. Woodhouse” that contained three
    bricks of cocaine.  The police removed the cocaine and replaced the bricks
    with three similar-looking bricks that contained flour.  They also left twenty
    grams of cocaine in the wrapping of one of the bricks.  They then arranged
    for a “controlled delivery” to K.&nbsp;Woodhouse’s address by an officer
    disguised as a UPS worker, during which time the residence was under police
    surveillance.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    police observed K. Woodhouse and another person leave separately in two of
    the three vehicles at the residence shortly before the delivery.  The appellant’s
    father’s car was the only car that remained outside.  The police then delivered
    the package.  The appellant took receipt and signed his own name.  Ten minutes
    later the police observed the appellant leaving the residence in his car
    with a gym bag.  At that time the police at the scene had been advised a
    warrant to search the residence had been issued but they had not yet received
    it.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    the appellant drove away in his vehicle, the police stopped him in a “high
    risk take down” and arrested him for possession of cocaine for the purposes
    of trafficking.  When the police entered the vehicle, they found the gym
    bag with three plastic bags that contained the “cocaine” bricks still sealed
    and unopened.  The appellant also had a marijuana joint and twenty grams
    of hashish. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant and K. Woodhouse were jointly charged with conspiracy to possess
    cocaine for the purpose of trafficking and possession of cocaine for the
    purpose of trafficking.  The appellant was also charged with simple possession
    of marijuana and possession of cannabis resin for the purpose of trafficking.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant brought a pre-trial motion alleging violations of his s. 8 and
    s. 9 <i>Charter</i> rights.  The trial judge dismissed the motion finding
    no <i>Charter </i>breaches.  After trial, he dismissed the conspiracy charge
    but entered convictions on the possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking,
    simple possession of marijuana and simple possession of cannabis resin as
    an included offence in the count of possession for the purpose of trafficking.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    principal ground on the appellant’s appeal of his convictions is that the
    police lacked reasonable grounds to arrest him.  We disagree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    was not contested that the officer who decided the appellant should be arrested
    subjectively believed he had reasonable grounds to arrest him.  The circumstances
    viewed in combination also met the objective standard required.  The appellant,
    who was the only person apparently in the house at the time of the delivery,
    after physically receiving the package, left shortly thereafter with a bag
    capable of carrying what had been delivered.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree with the trial judge there was no infringement of the appellant’s s.
    8 or s.&nbsp;9 <i>Charter</i> rights.  Even if we were persuaded there had
    been a breach, we would not exclude the evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown did not contest that the appellant’s summary conviction of simple possession
    of marijuana should be quashed on the basis that, in the circumstances of
    this case, this summary conviction offence should not have been tried together
    with the other offences charged, which were exclusively indictable. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the appellant’s summary conviction is quashed and the remainder of the appeal
    is dismissed.</p>
