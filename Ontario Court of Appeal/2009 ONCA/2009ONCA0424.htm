  <p><b><span lang=EN-US>By The Court:</span></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Appellant appeals his conviction and sentence on charges of trafficking in
    cocaine, possession of the proceeds of crime, offering to sell cocaine, and
    possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking.  He was sentenced to
    20 months imprisonment after credit of 28 months for pre-sentence custody,
    and three years probation.  For the following reasons the appeal is dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s primary defence at trial was mistaken identification.  He claimed
    that he did not sell or offer the drugs to the undercover police officer
    and suggested that it may have been someone else, Winston Ellis.  He also
    denied that he was in possession of drugs when he was searched during execution
    of a search warrant at
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    1119 Dufferin Street.  The appellant offered exculpatory explanations for
    the circumstantial evidence that supported the identification evidence.  He
    also claimed that he was beaten by the police during the search.  Finally,
    he suggested that he had been targeted by the police because of complaints
    he had made on prior occasions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge in very lengthy and comprehensive reasons dealt with all of the
    evidence and the explanations offered by the appellant.  The trial judge
    made no legal errors in his legal analysis.  He was alive to the principles
    concerning identification evidence, but also noted that this was a case of
    recognition, since the officer had previously dealt with the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    have also not been persuaded that the trial judge erred in his appreciation
    of the evidence.  For example, the appellant submitted that there was a discrepancy
    in the packaging of drugs that the police took from him during the search.  However,
    we are satisfied that the trial judge’s description is entirely accurate.  The
    trial judge was alive to the appellant’s explanations and, for example, acquitted
    him on one count of possession of proceeds of crime in view of the evidence
    that the appellant had withdrawn the money from the bank that seized from
    him during the search. In effect, the appellant is asking this court to retry
    the case and reach different conclusions as to who told the truth at the
    trial. We have no power to do so. It was for the trial judge to make those
    assessments and his conclusions are reasonable and grounded in the evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    mention one other matter.  At certain points during his oral submissions
    the appellant made allegations against his former counsel.  We offered the
    appellant the opportunity to adjourn his appeal so that he could properly
    raise these allegations of ineffective assistance of counsel.  The appellant
    declined this offer on several occasions and agreed that he would not raise
    ineffective assistance of counsel as a ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to sentence, the appellant sold and then offered to sell increasingly
    larger amounts of crack cocaine, a highly addictive substance.  He has a
    lengthy record going back to 1999 including offences of violence and weapons
    offences.  Given the seriousness of these offences and the appellant’s record
    a significant penitentiary sentence was required.  The trial judge took into
    account the appropriate mitigating circumstances, especially the appellant’s
    chaotic upbringing, but properly held that the paramount considerations were
    denunciation and deterrence.  As well, there was a particular need for specific
    deterrence, given the appellant’s continuing criminal behaviour and substance
    abuse.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the appeal from conviction is dismissed.  Leave to appeal sentence is granted,
    but the appeal is dismissed.</p>
