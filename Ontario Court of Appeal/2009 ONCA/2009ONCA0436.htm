  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant appeals an order striking the statement of claim pursuant to Rule
    21 as disclosing no cause of action.  The statement of claim alleged both
    slander and libel arising from statements made in relation to a disputed
    real estate transaction for which the appellant is alleged to have acted
    as the respondents’ agent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to slander the statement of claim pleads that the respondents verbally
    accosted the plaintiff at his office and accused him of being a “crook”.  The
    statement of claim alleges that the words complained of “were uttered in
    the presence of the plaintiff”. The motion judge struck out that allegation
    on the ground that the pleading failed to allege that the words complained
    of were spoken to any one other than the plaintiff.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    alleged libel arises from a letter written by the appellants’ solicitors
    and addressed to the appellant and to “Re/Max Hallmark Realty Ltd.”  The
    letter alleges certain suspicious circumstances arising from the sale of
    the home of the deceased for which the appellant acted as agent.  The appellant
    is said in the letter to have been employed at the time by “Re/Max Estates
    Ltd.”  The letter in effect puts the addressees on notice that a claim and
    a complaint to the Toronto Real Estate Board will most likely result from
    the disputed transaction.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>1.         Slander</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree with the motion judge that as the statement of claim fails to allege
    that the words complained of were spoken to anyone other than the plaintiff,
    the statement of claim fails to plead facts necessary to sustain a claim
    for slander.  Before us, the appellant did not quarrel with that proposition
    but argued that the motion judge should have given him an opportunity to
    amend the statement of claim.  However, when asked to explain the amendment
    that would be made should leave be granted, counsel was only able to state
    that the claim would be amended to say that the statement was made to the
    plaintiff and “other persons”.  Counsel added that the appellants could then
    ask for particulars of that allegation and that if adequate particulars were
    not given, the claim could be dismissed at that stage.  This explanation
    falls well short of persuading us that the appellant should be given the
    opportunity to amend the claim.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>2.         Libel</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge struck the libel claim on two grounds.
     First, the claim simply quotes the letter in its totality and fails to specify
    the very words complained of so as to enable the respondents to know how
    to plead to the claim.  Second, the motion judge concluded that as the letter
    was sent in the course of counsel’s investigation with a view to bringing
    a lawsuit, it attracted absolute privilege.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree that the statement of claim is deficient for failing to specify the
    very words complained of. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    this court, counsel for the appellant conceded that had the letter been addressed
    to the proper parties, it would have attracted absolute privilege.  The appellant
    points to the fact that the letter was addressed to “Re/Max Hallmark Realty
    Ltd.” but complained of the conduct of “Re/Max Estates Ltd.”  The appellant
    submits that as the statement of claim pleads that Re-Max Hallmark Realty
    Ltd. is an “unknown third party”, on the facts pleaded, the letter was addressed
    to a third-party stranger to the dispute and that therefore any privilege
    attaching to the letter would be lost.  While the appellant also pleads that “the
    content of the letter was communicated…to his employer”, when the pleading
    is read as a whole, it is apparent from the letter itself that it was only
    sent to the appellant at his employer’s address and not sent separately to
    his employer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the motion judge pointed out in his reasons, the threatened action was in
    fact commenced shortly after the letter was sent naming the appellant and
    Re/Max Hallmark Realty Ltd. as defendants.  That statement of claim was contained
    in the record before the motion judge and no issue is taken with its relevance
    to the issue before us.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the light of the positions taken by the parties before the motion judge and
    before this court, it would be inappropriate for us to make any pronouncement
    on the application of absolute privilege and we refrain from doing so.  Our
    decision is limited to a response to the point argued before us. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant based the appeal against striking the claim for libel on one point,
    namely, the submission that the letter was send to a third-party stranger
    to the dispute. We reject that submission.  Shortly after the letter was
    sent, the very claim it threatened was initiated against the very parties
    to whom the letter was addressed.  On that basis, we see no reason to interfere
    with the decision of the motion judge that the statement of claim of claim
    should be struck out pursuant to Rule 21. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    view of this conclusion it is unnecessary for us to consider whether leave
    to amend should be given to permit the appellant to specify the very words
    complained of.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Conclusion</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly
    the appeal was dismissed with costs to the respondents fixed at $7500.</p>
