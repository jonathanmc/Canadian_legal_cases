  <h4><span lang=EN-US>INTRODUCTION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>    The
    Peel Regional Police Service (the “Peel Police Service”) appeals the judgment
    of Somers J. granting an injunction prohibiting it from making any reference
    to withdrawn criminal charges of sexual assault and sexual exploitation when
    responding to any inquiries made to it by any organization or individual
    about Mr. Tadros, the respondent.  The application judge held that disclosure
    of the information was not authorized by the <i>Municipal Freedom of Information
    and Protection of Privacy Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. M.56 (“MFIPPA”) or the <i>Police
    Services Act,</i> R.S.O. 1990, c. P.15 (“PSA”).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>    The
    application judge also considered the respondent’s alternative argument that
    disclosure of the information violated ss. 7, 11(d) and 15 of the <i>Canadian
    Charter of Rights and Freedoms.</i>  He found that the disclosure did not
    violate the <i>Charter</i>.  The respondent cross-appeals from this decision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>    For
    the following reasons, the appeal is allowed and the injunction is set aside.  The
    cross-appeal by the respondent is dismissed.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>    The
    respondent is 57 years of age and trained in social work.  In 1998, he opened
    a group home in Peel Region.  The group home was licensed by the Ministry
    of Social Services and provided a home for approximately six children.  On
    May 22, 2002, the Peel Police Service charged the respondent with four counts
    of sexual assault and four counts of sexual exploitation with respect to
    allegations made by children who were residents in his group home.  The Ministry
    withdrew the respondent’s licence to operate the home and it closed a week
    after the charges were laid.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>    About
    a year and a half later on October 30, 2003, an Assistant Crown Attorney
    withdrew the charges.  For his part, the respondent agreed to enter into
    a peace bond that included terms that for nine months he keep the peace,
    be of good behaviour and not be in the company of any person under the age
    of 14 years unless accompanied by an adult.  At the time of entering into
    the peace bond, the respondent’s counsel stated that the respondent “does
    not acknowledge the facts as alleged in the information”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>    The
    Peel Police Service keeps records of occurrences, which includes records
    of withdrawn charges.  The records relating to the respondent show that the
    charges were ultimately withdrawn and that the respondent entered into the
    peace bond.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>    In
    August 2004, January 2005 and April 2006 the respondent signed Toronto Police
    Service authorization forms requesting a Criminal Records Search in relation
    to his prospective employment with a group home or as a counsellor.  Those
    searches showed that the respondent did not have any criminal convictions.  However,
    because the respondent was seeking employment that would bring him into contact
    with vulnerable people, he also requested a Vulnerable Persons Search. Vulnerable
    persons are individuals who, because of age or disability, are in a position
    of dependence and at greater risk than the general population of being harmed
    by persons in positions of trust or authority.  The Toronto Police Service
    authorization for a Vulnerable Persons Search asks the Toronto Police Service
    to search national and local data banks and provide the applicant with a
    summary of information obtained.  The authorization contains the following
    statement at the top of the form:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>POLICE REFERENCE CHECK PROGRAM </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>***CONSENT TO DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL INFORMATION***</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>TO BE USED ONLY TO ASSIST THE AGENCY TO DETERMINE
    THE SUITABILITY OF SUCCESSFUL CANDIDATES FOR EITHER FULL OR PART-TIME EMPLOYMENT
    AND/OR VOLUNTEER DUTIES, (INCLUDING AGENCY BOARD MEMBERS AND CONTACT MEMBERS)
    HAVING DIRECT CONTACT WITH CHILDREN OR VULNERABLE PERSONS.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    also contains the following consent provision: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I HEREBY REQUEST THE TORONTO POLICE SERVICE TO
    UNDERTAKE A POLICE REFERENCE CHECK ON ME BY SEARCHING THE APPROPRIATE DATA
    BANKS, BOTH NATIONAL AND LOCAL TO WHICH THE SERVICE HAS ACCESS AND PROVIDE
    ME WITH A SUMMARY OF ANY INFORMATION REVEALED PURSUANT TO THE POLICE REFERENCE
    CHECK PROGRAM. IN THE EVENT NO INFORMATION ABOUT ME IS FOUND AS PART OF THAT
    CHECK, I CONSENT TO THE
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    TORONTO POLICE SERVICE DISCLOSING THAT FACT TO THE ORGANIZATION IDENTIFIED
    BELOW. IN THE EVENT THAT PERTINENT INFORMATION IS PROVIDED TO ME, I CONSENT
    TO THE
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    TORONTO POLICE SERVICE DISCLOSING THAT FACT TO THE ORGANIZATION IDENTIFIED
    BELOW.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    a result of the respondent signing the Vulnerable Persons Search authorization,
    the Toronto Police Service contacted the Peel Police Service.  The Peel Police
    Service forwarded to the Toronto Police Service the information it had on
    file concerning the eight withdrawn charges.  The Toronto Police Service
    sent letters to the agencies to which the respondent had applied advising
    that the reference check had been completed and that the respondent had been
    mailed a summary sheet outlining the information on file.  Neither the Peel
    Police Service nor the Toronto Police Service disclosed the information directly
    to the agencies; whether or not to disclose the information was in the hands
    of the respondent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>    That
    said, the respondent alleges that somehow at least one of the agencies to
    which he applied learned of the withdrawn charges.  In any event, at some
    of the agencies to which the respondent applied he was not hired; at others
    he was briefly employed before his employment was terminated.  The respondent
    believes that he was refused employment or terminated shortly after gaining
    employment because of the results of the Vulnerable Persons Search.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent retained counsel who wrote to the Peel Police Service asking that
    information about the withdrawn charges not be disclosed and that the records
    of the charges be destroyed.  The Peel Police Service informed Mr. Tadros’ counsel
    that while the respondent could request destruction of his fingerprints and
    photographs, he had no right to require the Peel Police Service to destroy
    the records of the withdrawn charges.  The Peel Police Service subsequently
    purged the fingerprints and photographs of the respondent from its records,
    but not the records of the withdrawn charges. As a result, the respondent
    brought an application for an order requiring the Peel Police Service “to
    expunge from any and all Police Reference Check Reports (&quot;PRCR&quot;),
    including without limitation, any ‘vulnerable records search reports’ or
    any other reports, any reference to eight criminal charges against him of
    May 22, 2002, all of which were withdrawn by the Assistant Crown Attorney
    on October 30, 2003”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    should be noted that in this application, the respondent did not seek any
    order against the Toronto Police Service, which was not a party to the original
    application or to this appeal.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE REASONS OF THE APPLICATION JUDGE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge concluded that the collection of the information concerning
    charges against the respondent was lawful under MFIPPA and the PSA.  He also
    appears to have found that maintaining information that charges had been
    laid was not prohibited by the legislation.  However, there was nothing in
    the relevant legislation that authorized the release of information concerning
    withdrawn charges.  In particular, the disclosure of the information could
    not be justified on the basis of the consent or authorization forms signed
    by the respondent because the forms were not sufficiently specific in informing
    the respondent that information about withdrawn charges would be disclosed.  The
    application judge concluded as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There is a basic unfairness in the dissemination
    of this type of information as evidenced by the apparent effect it did have
    on his employment chances. It may well be that legislation did not deal specifically
    with withdrawn charges in recognition of the unfairness of the adverse effect
    of disseminating this information. In any event, the present practice of
    the police service in dealing with information about withdrawn charges seems
    to be based not upon any statutory provision, but upon customs and internal
    policy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge then turned to the <i>Charter</i> arguments and held that
    the respondent did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect
    to the records retained by the Peel Police Service.  He held that disclosure
    of the records did not deprive the respondent of his right to life, liberty
    or security of the person and, therefore, there was no violation of s. 8.  His
    right to the presumption of innocence under s. 11(d) was not infringed because
    the respondent was no longer charged with an offence.  Finally, there was
    no violation of the equality provisions in s. 15 as the respondent had not
    shown that he was subject to discrimination within the meaning of that section.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    a result, the application judge dismissed the application insofar as it required
    destruction of the records, but he made an order that the Peel Police Service “be
    prohibited and enjoined from making any reference to the eight withdrawn
    criminal charges of May 22, 2002, when replying in response to any inquires
    made to it by any authorized organization or individual about Mr. Tadros.”</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS </span></h4>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>Does the Peel Police Service
      have the authority to disclose the existence of withdrawn charges?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    collection and dissemination of personal information that relates to an individual’s
    interaction with the criminal justice system is governed in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario by a number of legislative and regulatory provisions: MFIPPA, the
    PSA and O. Reg. 265/98 to the PSA (the “Regulation”).<span class=MsoFootnoteReference> <a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></a></span> In Peel Region, By-Law No. 25-96 also deals with
    the retention of police records. Although By-Law 25-96 was passed pursuant
    to s. 116 of the <i>Municipal Act</i>, R.S.O. 1980 c. 302, which has
    been repealed and replaced, the appeal was argued on the basis that the By-Law
    continues in force. The status of the By-Law was not an issue on the appeal.<i></i></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Relevant Provisions</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>MFIPPA

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Analysis of the Regulation and Legislative Provisions</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent, Mr. Tadros, was not convicted or found guilty of any offence.
    He was charged with offences, but those charges were ultimately withdrawn
    at the time he entered into a common law peace bond. At the time the Peel
    Police Service provided the information regarding the withdrawn charges to
    the Toronto Police Service, the respondent was not charged with or under
    investigation for any offence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    appears to be accepted, correctly in our view, that withdrawn charges can
    be considered part of a person’s “criminal history” for the purposes of the
    definition of personal information. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    case was argued broadly on the question whether there are circumstances where
    the legislation allows the police to disclose information regarding withdrawn
    charges, either to “any person,” or to another police or correctional agency
    in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    . However, on the facts it is clear that the Peel Police Service disclosed
    the withdrawn charges to the Toronto Police Service based on the consent
    forms signed by Mr. Tadros for the purpose of the Vulnerable Persons Searches
    he authorized as part of his group home job application process. Therefore,
    if the police were entitled to disclose information regarding the withdrawn
    charges pursuant to Mr. Tadros’ consent, there is no need to decide the extent
    of the powers the police may have to disclose personal information without
    consent. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            Consent - Section 32(b) of MFIPPA</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    response to the Vulnerable Persons Search requests, the Peel Police Service
    disclosed the withdrawn charges to the Toronto Police Service. As noted above,
    it is unclear how the information came into the possession of anyone else,
    other than the respondent himself.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant, Peel Police Service, submits that it was entitled to release the
    information regarding the withdrawn charges to the Toronto Police Service
    based on consent, pursuant to s. 32(b) of MFIPPA, as the respondent signed
    consent forms authorizing Vulnerable Persons Searches of his records. The
    application judge concluded that because the consent form did not refer specifically
    to withdrawn charges, it would not have been sufficient to authorize disclosure
    of that information under s. 32(b), which requires that the person to whom
    the information relates “has identified that information in particular and
    consented to its disclosure.” The application judge reasoned that the respondent “might
    well expect” that information regarding the withdrawn charges would not be
    contained in police records, because he had never been previously convicted
    of an offence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant makes two submissions that support the inference that the respondent
    knew that he had withdrawn charges and a peace bond as part of his criminal
    history and that they would be disclosed on a Vulnerable Persons Search;
    therefore, by signing the consent and waiver forms, he consented to the disclosure
    of that information. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    first submission is that because the respondent received the results of the
    Criminal Records Search and was then asked for a further consent to disclose
    information other than his criminal record for the purpose of the Vulnerable
    Persons Search, he knew that information other than his criminal record could
    be disclosed, and he knew that eight sex-related charges against him had
    been withdrawn in exchange for a peace bond. Second, even if in respect of
    the first consent he did not know that the withdrawn charges would be disclosed,
    he certainly knew once he received the reports and once he was turned down
    for the social work jobs he was applying for, or when his employment at social
    work agencies was terminated. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, these are very persuasive arguments. When the application judge
    concluded that Mr. Tadros would not expect withdrawn charges to be retained
    and disclosed because he was never convicted of a criminal offence, he appears
    to have overlooked these factors. In an affidavit, Terri Pauli (Supervisor
    and Coordinator of Records for the Peel Police Service) provided evidence
    that it is the practice of the Toronto Police Service to require consent
    prior to the release of any information. Further, in a supplementary affidavit,
    Pauli gave evidence that “Mr. Tadros consented to a number of vulnerable
    records search requests, and apparently did so repeatedly with several agencies” (para.
    17). Mr. Tadros did not refute that evidence. Therefore, in our view, the
    application judge misapprehended the evidence and thereby erred to the extent
    that he found that the respondent did not give specific consent to the disclosure
    of the withdrawn charges in the circumstances of this case. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    intervener, the Information and Privacy Commissioner’s (the “Commissioner”)
    position is that s. 32 of MFIPPA, which prohibits disclosure of personal
    information by an institution, then provides exceptions to that prohibition,
    is an enabling section only, and that specific authorization is required
    by other legislation for disclosure in accordance with the exceptions. In
    this case, the Commissioner submits, s. 41(1.1) of the PSA and the Regulation
    form a complete code for disclosure of personal information by the police.
    Therefore, s. 32(b), which allows an institution to disclose with the consent
    of the affected individual, has no application in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    would not give effect to this argument. We need not decide the extent to
    which s. 41(1.1) of the PSA and the Regulation were intended by the legislature
    to set out the authority of the police to disclose personal information to
    other law enforcement agencies in Canada, and to any person when they deem
    it necessary to do so for any of the purposes provided in s. 41(1.2). However,
    that legislation is silent on the authority of police to disclose on the
    consent of the affected individual and to agencies outside
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    , as contemplated by ss. 32(b) and 32(f)(i) of MFIPPA.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    order to apply the presumption of coherence, effect must be given to every
    statutory provision to the fullest extent possible without legislative conflict.
    In <i>Lévis (City) v. Fraternité des policiers de Lévis Inc.,</i> [2007]
    1 S.C.R. 591, at para. 47, Bastarache J. explained the concept of legislative
    conflict and the presumption of legislative coherence as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The starting point in any analysis of legislative
    conflict is that legislative coherence is presumed, and an interpretation
    which results in conflict should be eschewed unless it is unavoidable. The
    test for determining whether an unavoidable conflict exists is well stated
    by Professor Côté in his treatise on statutory interpretation:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>According to case law, two statutes are not
    repugnant simply because they deal with the same subject: application of
    one must implicitly or explicitly preclude application of the other.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='color:black'>Thus, a law which provides
      for the expulsion of a train passenger who fails to pay the fare is not
      in conflict with another law that only provides for a fine because the
      application of one law did not exclude the application of the other. Unavoidable
      conflicts, on the other hand, occur when two pieces of legislation are
      directly contradictory or where their concurrent application would lead
      to unreasonable or absurd results. A law, for example, which allows for
      the extension of a time limit for filing an appeal only before it expires
      is in direct conflict with another law which allows for an extension to
      be granted after the time limit has expired. [Citations omitted.]</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is no conflict between the consent provision in s. 32(b) of MFIPPA and s.
    41(1.1) of the PSA and the Regulation. They can both operate where applicable.
    Nor is legislation necessary to implement the exception in s. 32(b). The
    exception is implemented each time by the authority of the consent given
    by the person whose personal information is to be disclosed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Commissioner also argues that the form of consent is not specific enough
    to be valid. To the extent that the authorities cited by the Commissioner
    support that conclusion, they are distinguishable. There was no duress that
    could vitiate consent of the sort considered in Investigation Report I 97-054M, <i>A
    County, </i>February 6, 1998, IPC/O, at pp. 4-5, or the decision of this
    court in <i>Cash Converters Canada Inc. v. Oshawa (City) (</i>2007), 86 O.R.
    (3d) 401 (C.A.), at para. 34. Nor was there a failure to specify in the authorization
    form the sources from which the personal information to be disclosed could
    be drawn: see Investigation Report I94-030P, <i>Ministry of the Solicitor
    General and Correctional Services, </i>October 12, 1994, IPC/O, at pp. 3-5.
    The authorization form that the respondent signed clearly stated that “data
    banks, both national and local to which the [Toronto Police Service] has
    access” would be canvassed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    fact that a person effectively must consent to a Vulnerable Persons Search
    in order to apply for certain types of jobs may be perceived as coercive
    and, in that way, possibly unfair. In regards to this alleged coercion, the
    affidavit evidence in this case indicates that these searches are necessary
    in order to give prospective employers involved with vulnerable persons all
    potentially relevant information about potential employees, within the bounds
    of the permissible disclosure of personal information under MFIPPA. Also,
    in a case where withdrawn charges which were false are disclosed, the potential
    employee has the ability to explain the circumstances to the proposed employer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Commissioner also takes the position that even if police may disclose with
    consent under s. 32(b) of MFIPPA, the chief of police is bound by s. 6 of
    the Regulation to exercise his or her discretion on each occasion before
    making any disclosure, and that he failed to do so in this case. We must
    respectfully disagree with the Commissioner on this issue as well. Section
    6 of the Regulation refers specifically to disclosures of personal information
    made under the authority of the Regulation. That would not be the case where
    disclosure is made on consent under s. 32(b) of MFIPPA.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Tadros authorized the Toronto Police Service to undertake Criminal Records
    and Vulnerable Persons Searches. The Peel Police Service disclosed the existence
    of the eight withdrawn charges against Mr. Tadros to the Toronto Police Service
    based on the consent forms signed by Mr. Tadros for the purpose of the Vulnerable
    Persons Searches that he authorized. Pursuant to s. 32(b) of MFIPPA, a chief
    of police may disclose personal information with the specific consent of
    the affected person. The information regarding withdrawn charges against
    Mr. Tadros was personal information under MFIPPA. There is no basis for an
    injunction to restrain disclosure where the proper consent is given. In our
    view, the proper consent was given by Mr. Tadros. There is no conflict between
    s. 32(b) of MFIPPA and the PSA or the Regulation that would operate to eliminate

    state without the person’s consent:  <i>Quebec v. Laroche,</i> [2002] 3 S.C.R.
    708 at para. 52.  Further, even if the police action constitutes a search
    or seizure, the police action will be reasonable if it is authorized by a
    reasonable law and carried out in a reasonable manner.  We begin with the
    question of whether there was an invasion of a reasonable expectation of
    privacy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is important to focus on the action by the Peel Police Service.  Their only
    action was to disclose to the Toronto Police Service in accordance with a
    valid consent under s.&nbsp;32(b) of MFIPPA information that was lawfully
    in their possession.  In our view, there is no possible basis for characterizing
    this disclosure of lawfully obtained information as an invasion of privacy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    begin by acknowledging that the <i>Charter</i> is to be interpreted generously
    and as was said in <i>R. v. Dyment</i>, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 417 at 426, s. 8
    in particular “must be interpreted in a broad and liberal manner so as to
    secure the citizen's right to a reasonable expectation of privacy against
    governmental encroachments” and that its “spirit must not be constrained
    by narrow legalistic classifications based on notions of property and the
    like which served to protect this fundamental human value in earlier times”.  Further,
    as was said in <i>Dyment</i> at pp. 429-30: “retention of information about
    oneself is extremely important. We may, for one reason or another, wish or
    be compelled to reveal such information, but situations abound where the
    reasonable expectations of the individual that the information shall remain
    confidential to the persons to whom, and restricted to the purposes for which
    it is divulged, must be protected.  Governments at all levels have in recent
    years recognized this and have devised rules and regulations to restrict
    the uses of information collected by them to those for which it was obtained;
    see, for example, the <i>Privacy Act</i>, S.C. 1980-81-82-83, c. 111.”  However,
    statutory recognition of privacy rights does not itself create <i>Charter</i> rights.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, there was no invasion of the respondent’s privacy by the actions
    of the Peel Police Service.  The information in the possession of the Peel
    Police Service was lawfully obtained and retained.  Even the original obtaining
    of the information did not constitute a search or seizure, unlike the taking
    of fingerprints or photographs as was dealt with by this court in <i>R. v.
    Dore</i> (2002), 166 C.C.C. (3d) 225.  And, it will be recalled that the
    Peel Police Service offered to destroy the fingerprints and photographs.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    information about the withdrawn charges was, moreover, a record of events
    that took place in a public courtroom.  Disclosure of this information by
    the Peel Police Service to the Toronto Police Service is not a search.  Nor
    is the disclosure by Peel a seizure; the disclosure did not involve the taking
    of any thing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
    if there was a search or seizure the respondent has not made out a violation
    of s. 8.  The disclosure of the information was authorized by law, namely
    s. 32 of MFIPPA, and the respondent has not attacked the constitutionality
    of that legislation.  The respondent has not been able to articulate any
    basis upon which it could be said that the search or seizure, if there was
    one, was not executed in a reasonable manner.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Section 7 of the <i>Charter</i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent submits that disclosure by the Peel Police Service to the Toronto
    Police Service violates his right to privacy, which is protected by s. 7
    of the <i>Charter</i>.  The respondent submits that this disclosure infringes
    his liberty or security interests guaranteed by s. 7 and in a manner that
    does not accord with the principles of fundamental justice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is now well-established that “liberty” embraces more than freedom from physical
    constraint and includes the right to make inherently personal choices free
    from state interference; these must be choices that “go to the core of what
    it means to enjoy individual dignity and independence”:  <i>R. v. Malmo-Levine;
    R. v. Caine</i>, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 571 at para. 85.  In our view, the disclosure
    by one police service to another of information obtained through the public
    prosecution of an individual does not fall within this concept of liberty.  It
    was the respondent who set in motion the disclosure through his request to
    the Toronto Police Service.  His right to liberty does not include the right
    to censor accurate information lawfully held by the Peel Police Service.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    are similarly of the view that the respondent’s right to security of the
    person is not infringed.  The s. 7 guarantee to security of the person is
    triggered only by state interference in “profoundly intimate and personal
    choices”:  <i>Blencoe v.
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    British Columbia (Human Rights Commission)</i>, [2000] 2 S.C.R. 307 at para.
    83.  The respondent’s choice to seek the Vulnerable Persons Search was not
    state interference in any protected intimate and personal choice.  Section
    7 does not guarantee a right to work in any particular job or career.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
    if there was an infringement of the respondent’s right to liberty or security
    of the person he has also failed to identify any principle of fundamental
    justice that was infringed.  The disclosure by the Peel Police Service to
    the Toronto Police Service was in accordance with valid provincial legislation
    that has not been directly attacked.  In our view, it is not open to the
    respondent to argue that the disclosure was contrary to the principles of
    fundamental justice without putting in issue the provincial legislation that
    authorizes that disclosure.  In his factum, the respondent acknowledges that
    he has not mounted a constitutional challenge to the legislation but nevertheless
    claimed that the legislation was not reasonable.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a>  In our view, this argument is not open to the
    respondent.  The only basis for finding that the legislation might be unreasonable
    would be by attacking its constitutional validity.  Mr. Ruby on behalf of
    the respondent did not pursue the alleged unreasonableness of the legislation
    in oral argument.</p>

lang=EN-US>Federal legislation, in particular the <i>Criminal Records Act</i>,
      R.S.C. 1985, c.C-47 and the <i>Criminal Code, </i>R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46,
      contain provisions relating to the retention of records. The <i>Criminal
      Records Act </i>deals with records of convictions for which pardons have
      been granted as well as with discharges. If an individual is discharged
      under s. 730 of the <i>Criminal Code, </i>the record is removed from the
      automated criminal records retrieval system maintained by the Royal Canadian
      Mounted Police. Regulations passed pursuant to the <i>Criminal Records
      Act </i>provide guidelines for disclosure as well as consent forms to authorize
      searches for and disclosure of records for certain criminal sexual offences.
      The <i>Criminal Code </i>provisions on records relate specifically to individuals
      dealt with under alternative measures: s. 32 (d). </span></p>
