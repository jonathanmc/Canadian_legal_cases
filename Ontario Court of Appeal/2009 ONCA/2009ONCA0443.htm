  <h4><span lang=EN-US>By-the-Court:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was charged with first degree murder in 1998.  He was convicted
    in 1999.  This court ordered a new trial in 2002:  <i>R. v. Paul</i> (2002),
    170 C.C.C. (3d) 107.  The appellant was convicted of first degree murder
    on the re-trial in March 2004.  He appealed alleging several errors at trial.  He
    also contended that the transcript of the trial proceedings contained so
    many errors that he was effectively denied a meaningful right of appeal based
    on a complete trial record.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    court dismissed the appeal at the end of oral argument with reasons to follow.  These
    are those reasons.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Identity
    was the only issue at trial.  Much of the evidence is summarized in the earlier
    judgment of this court.  For present purposes, it is sufficient to outline
    the case in broad terms.  It was the theory of the Crown that the deceased
    was abducted by the appellant while she was in his apartment building with
    a co-worker soliciting subscribers for a local daily newspaper.  On the Crown’s
    theory, the appellant sexually assaulted the deceased, strangled her, and
    at some point later that evening deposited her body in the stairwell several
    feet from the apartment where he lived.  The appellant did not testify.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown’s case relied primarily on expert evidence interpreting DNA samples
    retrieved from stains containing semen found on two articles of clothing
    worn by the deceased.  The semen samples were very small.  According to the
    expert’s evidence, the appellant’s DNA was a match at six loci and he could
    not be excluded as a contributor at the remaining three loci tested.  The
    expert opined that he could not exclude the appellant as the donor of the
    sperm found on either item of clothing.  A second expert gave statistical
    evidence suggesting only a very slight possibility that someone other than
    the appellant had deposited the sperm.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown also led evidence of a statement made by the appellant to a police
    officer a few hours after the discovery of the deceased’s body.  The police
    were canvassing the residences in the apartment building hoping to get some
    information that would assist in the investigation of the homicide.  The
    appellant was shown a picture of the deceased.  He told the police officer
    that he had never seen the deceased before and that she had not canvassed
    his apartment.  The Crown contended that there was circumstantial evidence
    suggesting that the deceased had canvassed the appellant’s apartment and
    that the DNA evidence showed that he had been in very close contact with
    her shortly before she died.  The Crown urged the jury to find that the appellant
    had deliberately lied to the officer investigating the deceased’s death to
    avoid his own responsibility for the homicide.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown also placed reliance on the location where the body was found.  The
    body was found in the stairwell a very short distance from the appellant’s
    apartment.  The positioning of the body also suggested that the person who
    had placed the body there had entered the stairwell from the sixth floor
    or higher.  The appellant lived on the sixth floor.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defence did not call any expert evidence challenging the Crown’s DNA evidence.  Defence
    counsel did, however, vigorously challenge that evidence on cross-examination.  The
    defence contended that the Crown expert had changed important parts of his
    evidence from his earlier testimony on a <i>voir dire</i> to determine admissibility.  The
    defence also contended that the Crown expert had approached his analysis
    in a way that gave the Crown the benefit of any doubt the expert had in interpreting
    the results of the tests.  Defence counsel stressed both features of the
    cross-examination in his closing.  No objection was taken on appeal to the
    manner in which the trial judge put the position of the defence or to his
    review of the substance of the expert evidence.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE GROUNDS OF APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p><b><span lang=EN-US>(i)        The <i>Corbett</i> Application</span></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At
      the conclusion of the Crown’s case, the defence brought an application
      for an order preventing the Crown from cross-examining the appellant on
      his criminal record should the appellant testify (the “<i>Corbett</i>”
    application).  Counsel indicated that the defence would call the former husband
    of the deceased to demonstrate that he had a motive and the opportunity to
    commit the homicide.  Counsel did not provide details of the appellant’s
    proposed evidence except to indicate that the appellant would offer some
    explanation for the statement he gave to the police officer a few hours after
    the body was discovered.  It would seem that the appellant would admit that
    he had not been entirely truthful with the police officer but would offer
    an explanation centered on a mistrust of the police based on his prior experience
    with the police.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant was convicted of indecent assault in 1981 and received a suspended
      sentence.  He was convicted in August of 1996 of sexual assault, assault
      causing bodily harm, uttering threats, forcible confinement and overcoming
      resistance to the commission of a criminal offence.  All of the 1996 charges
      arose out of a single event. The appellant received a sentence of 2 years
      less a day and 3 years probation.  He was released from custody, having
      completed the custodial portion of his sentence, in December 1997, about
      3 months before the murder.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      careful reasons, the trial judge acknowledged his discretion to limit or
      prohibit entirely cross-examination of the appellant on his prior record.  The
      trial judge recognized that the exercise of that discretion depended on
      a balancing of the potential assistance cross-examination on the record
      could provide the jury when assessing the appellant’s credibility against
      the potential prejudice to the appellant should the jury be informed that
      he had been convicted in 1996 of serious criminal offences that bore some
      resemblance to the allegations in this case.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge examined the relevant authorities from this court and the Supreme
      Court of Canada, identified the operative principles, reviewed the salient
      facts and applied the principles to those facts.  In oral argument, counsel
      for the appellant specifically disavowed any claim that the trial judge
      had misstated the principles or misapprehended the evidence.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge ultimately held that the Crown could not cross-examine the
      appellant on his 1981 conviction but that he could cross-examine on the
      1996 convictions.  The trial judge further held that there could not be
      any reference to the sexual nature of the 1996 assault and that it should
      be described only as an assault.  The trial judge further held that the
      Crown could cross-examine on the penalties imposed and on the fact that
      the appellant was on probation and parole at the time of this homicide.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Absent
      an error in principle or a misapprehension of material evidence, this court
      can interfere with a trial ruling based on the exercise of judicial discretion
      only if that exercise is unreasonable:  see <i>R. v. G. (E.P.)</i> (1994),
      89 C.C.C. (3d) 176 at 180 (Ont. C.A.).  Counsel for the appellant contends
      that allowing cross-examination of the 1996 convictions was so prejudicial
      and of so little probative value on the question of the appellant’s credibility
      that the trial judge’s decision is properly characterized as unreasonable.  Counsel
      contends that the ruling permitting cross-examination, even of the modified
      record, flung open the door to forbidden propensity reasoning while providing
      little or no insight into the appellant’s credibility.   </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We
      cannot agree with this submission.  Cross-examination of a witness, including
      an accused, on his or her criminal record is presumptively admissible.  A
      judge may, in the exercise of his or her discretion, disallow cross-examination
      where he or she is satisfied that despite the safeguards available in the
      trial process, most especially a proper jury instruction, the potential
      prejudice flowing from that cross-examination is sufficient to justify
      exclusion of cross-examination on the record.  As Dickson C.J.C. observed
      in <i>R. v. Corbett</i> (1988), 41 C.C.C. (3d) 385 at 399-401, trial by
      jury assumes that as a general rule, juries will follow limiting instructions.  That
      assumption must be given due weight when a trial judge is asked to exclude
      cross-examination in a “<i>Corbett</i>”
    application.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>We
      also reject the submission that because the criminal record did not involve
      acts of dishonesty, it could offer little, if any, assistance to the jury
      in assessing the appellant’s credibility:  <i>R. v. Saroya</i> (1994),
      36 C.R. (4<sup>th</sup>) 253 at paras. 10-11 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  We do at the same time acknowledge that the nature and the timing of
    the 1997 convictions increased the risk of improper propensity reasoning
    if the jury was made aware of those convictions.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Counsel
      also submitted that the decision of this court on the first appeal holding
      that the events giving rise to the 1997 convictions were not admissible
      as similar fact evidence should have “informed” the ruling on the “<i>Corbett”</i> application
      at the retrial.  Counsel submits that as this court held that admitting
      evidence of the events underlying the 1997 convictions as part of the Crown’s
      case would carry an unacceptable risk of improper propensity reasoning,
      that cross-examination of the accused on the criminal record arising from
      those events, should he testify, must carry the same unacceptable risk.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge was obviously aware of this court’s ruling and referred to
      it in outlining the relevant history at the outset of his “<i>Corbett</i>” ruling.  He
      made no further reference to the decision in his analysis.  This court’s
      decision on the admissibility of the <i>events </i>underlying the 1997
      convictions as similar fact evidence and part of the Crown’s case has little,
      if anything, to do with the decision on the <i>“Corbett”</i> application.  The
      analyses are quite different.  Similar fact evidence is presumptively inadmissible.  To
      be admissible the evidence must provide a circumstantial chain of reasoning
      relevant to a material issue other than reasoning through general propensity.  Cross-examination
      of an accused who chooses to testify on his prior record is presumptively
      permitted.  The evidence is directly relevant to his credibility as a witness.  Nor,
      of course, does cross-examination on a criminal record permit the Crown
      to adduce evidence of the events underlying those criminal convictions.  The
      trial judge was acutely aware of the potential prejudice should he permit
      cross-examination on the criminal record.  His ruling reflects that concern.  Nothing
      in this court’s earlier ruling on the admissibility of the similar fact
      evidence would provide any additional insight into the prejudice that could
      flow from permitting cross-examination on the 1997 convictions. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge had a difficult decision to make on this “<i>Corbett</i>” application.  While
      the defence had not attacked the credibility of Crown witnesses, it did
      propose to point the finger of guilt at a third party.  No doubt, the defence
      would include a vigorous attack on the credibility of that person.  In
      addition, comments made by counsel suggested that the appellant would offer
      some explanation for his lie to the police which would open the door to
      questioning on his prior involvement with the criminal justice system.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge ultimately attempted to preserve the balance of fairness in
      the trial by permitting cross-examination on a part of the criminal record
      while forbidding reference to the 1981 convictions and reference to the
      sexual nature of the 1996 assault.  These were clearly the most potentially
      prejudicial aspects of the appellant’s record. Given the trial judge’s
      decision and the deference due to it, we do not think he erred in striking
      the balance as he did.</span></p>
  <p><b>(ii)  The Statement Made by the Appellant to the Police</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Shortly
    after the deceased’s body was found in the stairwell of the apartment building,
    the police began a canvass of the residences in the building.  At about 5:15
    a.m., a police officer spoke with the appellant in his apartment.  The appellant
    indicated that he had been home between 3:30 p.m. and 10:30 p.m. the previous
    day.  He told the officer that no one had come to his door selling newspaper
    subscriptions and he could not identify a picture of the deceased.  There
    was evidence that the deceased had canvassed the apartment next to the appellant’s
    and that she had told her colleague she would canvass the entire floor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the course of his jury instructions on the evidentiary use that could be
    made of the defendant’s statement, the trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>… if, in determining what weight you will give
    to that part of the statement denying any contact with Ms. Ricketts, you
    are satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, by “other evidence” that
    the Crown has proven it false, the “proved falsehood” becomes another item
    of circumstantial evidence to be considered in the context of the evidence
    as a whole, on the issue of identity. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The “other evidence” relied upon by the Crown to
    prove the falsity of this part of the statement is the opinion of Jonathan
    Newman [the DNA expert] concerning the presence of the defendant’s sperm
    on the deceased’s clothing.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The falsehood is a “proved falsehood” if the Crown
    satisfies you, on a balance of probabilities, that the statement was deliberately
    made by the defendant for the purpose of avoiding detection as the murderer.  Note,
    the emphasis on proved falsehood, proved deliberation and proved purpose.  They
    must all be proven on a balance of probabilities by other evidence accepted
    by you.  The mere rejection of a statement, or a material part of it, as
    false is not in itself a sufficient foundation for such an inference. …</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for the appellant submits that a single piece of evidence can never provide
    both the basis for a determination that an appellant’s statement was false
    and for the further determination that it was deliberately fabricated to
    avoid detection.  Counsel submits that as the DNA evidence could not carry
    the burden of both factual findings, the trial judge erred in instructing
    the jury that if it concluded, based on the DNA evidence, that the appellant’s
    statement was false, it could further infer, again based on the DNA evidence,
    that the false statement was made deliberately by the defendant for the purposes
    of avoiding detection.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    potential evidentiary value of false statements made by an accused turns
    on generally applicable principles of relevance and materiality as applied
    to the circumstances of the particular case.  The jurisprudence cannot be
    read as creating arbitrary or artificial rules of admissibility applicable
    exclusively where the Crown asserts that a statement made by an accused was
    not only false but concocted to conceal involvement in the crime: see <i>R.
    v. Jones</i> (2006), 211 C.C.C. (3d) 4 at para. 6 (Ont.
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    indicated in the leading case of <i>R. v. O’Connor</i> (2002), 170 C.C.C.
    (3d) 365 at 377 (Ont. C.A.), where a trier of fact is satisfied that an out-of-court
    statement made by an accused is false, the circumstances in which the statement
    was made and the content of the statement may reasonably permit the trier
    of fact to conclude that the statement was not only false but was fabricated
    to conceal the accused’s involvement in the offence.  The reference in <i>O’Connor</i> and
    many cases that have followed it to “independent evidence” of fabrication
    is intended to emphasize that a finding of fabrication does not flow automatically
    from a finding that the statement should be rejected as false.  There must
    be something more in the evidence that reasonably justifies the further inference
    that the false statement was deliberately made for the purpose of concealing
    the accused’s involvement in the offence:  see also <i>R. v. Hazal</i> (2009),
    ONCA 389 at paras. 11-20 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the DNA evidence offered a basis upon which the jury could conclude
    that the appellant lied when he told the police he had not seen the victim.  The
    circumstances in which he told the lie provided a further basis upon which
    the jury could infer that the appellant lied to cover-up his involvement
    in the homicide.  The police were going door to door soliciting information
    relevant to the deceased’s murder.  The appellant was told the purpose of
    the questions.  He was not a suspect, and he was not detained when questioned.  The
    jury could conclude from the DNA evidence that the appellant had had very
    close contact with the deceased but that he chose to tell a lie to the officer
    rather than acknowledge that contact.  In these circumstances, it was reasonably
    open to the jury to infer that the appellant chose to deliberately lie to
    the police because he wanted to cover-up his involvement in her homicide.  There
    can be no doubt but that the circumstances in which the appellant lied to
    the police (assuming, of course, the jury found that the appellant lied)
    reasonably permitted the inference that he lied to mislead the police and
    divert suspicion from himself.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge properly left the statement with the jury as evidence from which
    the jury could infer an intention to mislead the police and, hence, an involvement
    in the deceased’s murder.  As the trial judge made clear in his instructions,
    it was up to the jury to decide whether the statement was false and, if so,
    what inference to draw from the making of the false statement.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for the appellant also submits that the trial judge failed to tell the jury
    that if it had a reasonable doubt as to the truth of the appellant’s statement
    to the police, it must acquit the appellant.  The trial judge told the jury
    that if it accepted the exculpatory statement made by the appellant, it must
    acquit.  He certainly could have followed that instruction with a further
    instruction that if the jury had a reasonable doubt about the truth of the
    statement, considered in the context of the entirety of the evidence, that
    reasonable doubt also required an acquittal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Considering
    the charge as a whole, however, we are satisfied that the trial judge’s numerous
    statements to the jury that it must acquit if it had a reasonable doubt based
    on the totality of the evidence were sufficient to make it clear that a doubt
    as to the truth of the appellant’s statement to the police would necessitate
    an acquittal.  It is not reversible error to fail to mention the requirement
    of proof beyond a reasonable doubt at every juncture in the instruction where
    it could be mentioned.</p>
  <p><b>(iii)  The Alleged Unequal Treatment of the Respective Theories of the
      Defence and the Crown</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    argument goes to the fairness of the jury instruction and the ultimate fairness
    of the trial.  Counsel for the appellant submits that the trial judge improperly
    invited the jury to speculate as to how the appellant and the deceased came
    to meet in the apartment building prior to her death.  Counsel submits that
    the trial judge offered this speculation to support the Crown’s theory that
    the appellant was the killer.  Counsel for the appellant further argues that
    in contrast to this approach to the Crown’s case, the trial judge labelled
    as speculation an innocent explanation for the DNA evidence advanced by the
    defence in closing argument.  Counsel for the appellant candidly acknowledges
    that there was little, if any, evidence to support the innocent explanation
    advanced by the defence, but he submits that it was fatally unfair to characterize
    the defence position as speculation while at the same time inviting the jury
    to use speculation to fill gaps in the Crown’s theory of the case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    submission misreads the trial judge’s instructions.  The passages in which
    counsel for the appellant argues that the trial judge invited the jury to
    speculate in aid of the Crown theory had nothing to do with the Crown’s theory.  The
    trial judge was merely using hypothetical examples to demonstrate the meaning
    and limits of the requirement of jury unanimity in arriving at a verdict.  He
    used three hypothetical examples, two of which would result in convictions
    and one of which would result in an acquittal.  He made it clear that his
    examples were given for the purpose of explaining the limits of the unanimity
    requirement.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge fully and fairly addressed the positions of the Crown and defence
    in subsequent parts of his jury instruction.  In describing the defence position,
    the trial judge did indicate that in his opinion, the explanation advanced
    by counsel in closing argument for the presence of the appellant’s semen
    on the deceased’s clothing was speculation.  We agree.  It was speculation.   </p>
  <p><b>(iv)  The Reasonable Doubt Instruction as it Applied to the DNA Evidence</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for the appellant made several closely linked submissions concerning the
    DNA evidence and the burden of proof.  Ultimately, we understand him to have
    argued that the jury should have been told that if it had a reasonable doubt
    as to whether the appellant could be excluded as the donor of the DNA at
    any of the sites tested, it must acquit the appellant.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    burden of proof applies to the entirety of the evidence and not to individual
    pieces of evidence unless, of course, proof of an essential element of an
    offence depends entirely on a single piece of evidence.  As important as
    the DNA evidence was in this case, it did not stand alone on the identity
    issue.  As set out above, the very close proximity of the appellant’s residence
    to the stairwell where the body was found and his statement to the police
    provided some support for the Crown’s contention that the appellant was the
    killer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the DNA evidence did not stand alone, it was certainly central to the Crown’s
    case.  It is fair to say that a jury acting reasonably could not have convicted
    the appellant without accepting the evidence of the Crown expert.  The trial
    judge’s instructions made the importance of the expert DNA evidence crystal
    clear.  There can be no doubt that the jury appreciated the importance of
    that evidence.  We reject the submission that the trial judge was obliged
    as a matter of law to tell the jury that a doubt about one aspect of the
    testimony given by the expert, as important as that piece of evidence might
    have been, would necessitate an acquittal.  The jury had to assess the totality
    of the expert’s evidence and place it in the context of the rest of the evidence.  The
    burden of proof and the appellant’s entitlement to an acquittal if the jury
    had a reasonable doubt on the totality of the evidence was properly and repeatedly
    explained to this jury.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    also argued that the trial judge should have instructed the jury that the
    Crown expert had taken an improper approach in his analysis of the raw data
    upon which his opinion was based and that it must acquit if the jury believed
    that the expert had entertained “reasonable doubts”
    about the interpretation of some of the raw data.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Witnesses,
    including expert witnesses, are not called upon to apply the burden of proof
    before giving their testimony.  The jury applies that burden to their testimony.  A
    jury could only be confused by instructions that somehow suggested that expert
    witnesses had to have regard to the burden of proof when formulating their
    opinions.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>More
    to the point, counsel’s submission assumes that it was common ground that
    the Crown expert gave the benefit of “reasonable doubts”
    to the Crown in his preparation.  He denied that he did so.  This debate
    over the expert’s approach to the raw data was a central feature of his cross-examination.  The
    respective positions of the parties were fully and fairly dealt with by the
    trial judge in his instructions.  He did not, quite properly, frame the defence
    submission as a legal proposition compelling an acquittal.    </p>
  <p><b>(v)  The Errors in the Transcript</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately,
    counsel for the appellant encountered many difficulties in perfecting this
    appeal.  Initially, the trial exhibits could not be found.  The first version
    of the trial transcript provided to counsel for the appellant was replete
    with errors.  In his factum, counsel argued that the appellant’s right of
    appeal was effectively denied by the combined effect of the missing exhibits
    and the multitude of errors in the transcription of the trial proceedings.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    counsel for the appellant had filed his factum, Crown counsel was able to
    locate the exhibits.  They are now before the court.  None were referred
    to during counsel for the appellant’s two hour oral argument.  Crown counsel
    also obtained a revised version of the trial transcript.  Counsel for the
    appellant concedes that the revised version corrects many of the errors contained
    in the initial transcript.  He argues, however, that there remain literally
    hundreds of uncorrected errors in the second version of the transcript.  Counsel
    has catalogued all of these errors and placed them in several different categories.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for the appellant does not point to any error or group of errors that has
    actually interfered with his ability to advance any of the numerous grounds
    that he put forward on behalf of the appellant.  Nor has counsel suggested
    that any error or combination of errors has created any genuine uncertainty
    as to the substance of the testimony of any of the witnesses or the content
    of the trial judge’s instruction to the jury.  Counsel has rested his submission
    on the proposition that at some point the sheer quantity of errors in the
    transcript necessitates a quashing of the conviction without any demonstration
    of actual prejudice flowing from those errors.  He contends that prejudice
    must be assumed from the quantity of the errors.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    cannot accept this argument.  Errors or inadequacies in the transcription
    of the trial proceedings are germane on appeal to the extent that the correction
    of the errors reveals grounds for appeal, or the state of the transcript
    prevents the appellant from pursuing a meaningful appeal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    vast majority of errors uncovered by counsel for the appellant involve one,
    two or three words in the transcript.  In many instances, the errors are
    obvious as is the necessary correction.  Many of the errors appear in parts
    of the transcript that have virtually no relevance to the prosecution of
    an appeal from conviction.  For example, many errors appear in the transcription
    of counsel’s submissions in various legal arguments made at trial.  None
    of the errors render the transcript incomplete or misleading in any meaningful
    way or impede the pursuit of the appeal.  In short, the errors are inconsequential
    to the appeal.  There is no merit in this ground of appeal.  </p>
