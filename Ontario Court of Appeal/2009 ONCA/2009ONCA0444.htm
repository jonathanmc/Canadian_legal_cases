  <h4><span lang=EN-US>I.          INTRODUCTION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    White seeks to set aside the judgment of Justice Keith Hoilett of the Superior
    Court of Justice dismissing his action for damages for breach of contract,
    breach of fiduciary duty and misrepresentation.  The appeal concerns only
    the dismissal of the misrepresentation claim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>II.        FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant joined the predecessor of Colliers Macaulay Nicholls Inc. (“Colliers”)
    in 1975 when it was a small real estate service company with a professional
    staff of a dozen people.  By the time he was asked to retire in 2001, the
    company had grown to over 1500 employees and had operations throughout
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    and the
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      United States</st1:country-region>
    .  Mr. White had risen through the ranks over the years and served for a
    lengthy period as the President of the Company.  He became Vice-Chair in
    1997, a position he retained until he left.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was also the third largest shareholder of the company – the holder
    of 400,050 shares representing 5.6% of the outstanding common shares.  He
    was party to a Shareholders’ Agreement dated February 10, 1998 which required
    him to sell his shares to Colliers – and Colliers to buy<a
href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a> – upon the termination of his employment (whether
    voluntary or involuntary) at a price to be determined in accordance with
    a formula set out in the Agreement.  There is no dispute that based on the
    date of his departure, in March 2001, the price generated by that formula
    was US$5.21 per share.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s departure was not voluntary.  He was asked to retire.  However,
    his retirement did not take place until after an oral agreement had been
    struck between him and the Chairman and CEO of Colliers, John McLernon, in
    December 2000 and the agreement had been confirmed by a letter dated March
    9, 2001 and signed by the appellant on March 15 (I shall refer to the oral
    agreement, as confirmed by the March letter, as “the Retirement Agreement”).  The
    Retirement Agreement called for a “retirement allowance” of $400,000 to be
    paid in accordance with an attached payment schedule and stipulated that
    the appellant’s shares were to be “dealt with under the Shareholders Agreement
    as to value and timing.”  As I have indicated, there has never been any disagreement
    as to the “value” to be paid for the shares under the Shareholders’ Agreement
    and the Retirement Agreement –
    US$5.21 per share.  It is the “timing”
    element that has been the catalyst for the lawsuits that followed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Colliers
    did not pay the appellant in the timely fashion he expected.  Colliers had
    liquidity and financial problems in the late 1990’s and early 2000’s, particularly
    following the events of “9/11” in September, 2001.  It also had a sizeable
    list of other departing shareholders in a similar position to Mr. White and
    generating similar buy-out obligations on the part of the company.  Colliers
    did not have the cash to meet these obligations.  It justified the failure
    to pay Mr. White at the time by relying on a provision in the Shareholders’ Agreement
    making the purchase of shares subject to permission from the company’s lenders
    and stating that its principal lender, HSBC, prohibited it from using its
    capital to purchase shares.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was unhappy with Colliers’ failure to honour the Retirement Agreement
    in a timely fashion.  He was anxious as well to preserve his price of US$5.21
    as the market value of the Collier shares was falling at the time (it reached
    a low of US$3.00 per share in late 2002).  In November, 2002 the appellant
    sued Colliers, claiming damages consisting primarily of compensation for
    his shares at the US$5.21 price in accordance with the Shareholders’ Agreement
    and the Retirement Agreement (“the 2002 Lawsuit”).  Alternatively, he claimed
    damages in a similar amount for negligent misrepresentations allegedly inducing
    him to enter into the Retirement Agreement. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    2002 Lawsuit was settled on June 22, 2004 – a settlement in which Mr. White
    achieved virtually everything he sought in the lawsuit plus an additional
    CDN$150,000.  In accordance with the settlement,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Colliers
    agreed to purchase the appellant’s 400,050 common shares, and the appellant
    transferred those shares to the Company, for a total amount of US$2,083,548.08;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    White received the sum of US$500,000 immediately.  He received a US$1,583,548.08
    promissory note as security for the balance payable in four equal annual
    instalments of US$395,887.02, each with interest at HSBC prime plus 1% per
    annum on each anniversary of June 22, 2004;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Colliers
    agreed to pay the appellant an additional amount of CDN$150,000, payable
    by way of $50,000 to the appellant’s counsel, immediately, for costs, and
    a further $100,000 secured by a promissory note, payable on January 4, 2005,
    with interest (as above);</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>d)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Colliers
    and the appellant also signed consents to judgment on the promissory notes,
    to be held in trust by counsel for the appellant and to be released to the
    appellant, and acted on, only in the event of default under either promissory
    note; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>e)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant executed a full and final general release in favour of Colliers. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Colliers
    has paid, and the appellant has continued to accept, the various payments
    called for under the settlement agreement as they have become due.  In spite
    of this, the appellant sued again, in 2005 (“the 2005 Lawsuit”).  It is the
    circumstances surrounding the settlement of the 2002 Lawsuit that he says
    form the basis of his entitlement to succeed in the present action.  He alleges
    that he was induced to enter into the settlement of that action by misrepresentations
    made on behalf of Colliers by its senior officers during the period leading
    up to the settlement in June 2004.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    misrepresentations alleged at trial and on appeal –
    although not pleaded – are said to have been made by Mark Cowie, a senior
    employee of Colliers who had been asked by Collier’s CEO, Douglas Frye, to
    negotiate a settlement of the 2002 Lawsuit, and by Mr. Frye himself.  The
    thrust of the misrepresentations is that nothing was happening in Colliers
    at the time that would affect the value of its shares.  The appellant alleges
    this was false.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant testified that Mark Cowie called him at the end of March 2004 and
    told him the company wished to settle the pending lawsuit – which was scheduled
    for trial in November of that year – and was then in a position to do so
    because a number of senior executives had guaranteed a note with HSBC that
    would make money available to do so.  Mr. White says he was curious why senior
    executives would suddenly do that and why there was such urgency in settling
    the action.  He says he asked:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>So I asked him [Cowie] if anything was happening
    with the company that was going to affect the value of the shares and he
    said not to his – I believe the answer was not to his knowledge, no.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    White further testified that on May 31, 2004, Douglas Frye telephoned him,
    expressing a desire to get the deal done and completed.  He says he asked
    Mr. Frye why the company was proceeding to settle at this point and whether
    there was anything happening in the company that would affect the value of
    the shares.  The answer was “no”.  This was his testimony:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
    what did Mr. Frye say to you?  Tell us what you remember of that call?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Well,
    I – he expressed a desire to get this deal done and completed. …  He – I
    asked him why they were proceeding at this point in time and what effect
    this would have –
    was there anything happening in the company that would affect the value of
    these shares.  And he said no, that he was proceeding at this point in time
    because he had been getting a great deal of heat from the shareholder employees
    about the company’s inability to deal with departed shareholders and he wanted
    to resolve that and clean that mess up.  I had some sympathy with that position
    in from what I had heard, he had had a lot of heat on that issue.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
    are you clear that you asked him if there was anything happening which would
    affect the value of the company and his answer being no?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        Absolutely.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant alleges these representations were untrue because Colliers by that
    time had embarked on a formal search for liquidity capital in a process that
    could well result in a change of control transaction.  He says that he relied
    upon the representations and would not have settled the 2002 Lawsuit had
    he known –
    as he submits is the case – they were not true.  The allegation that they
    were not true arises in the following context.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    the Fall of 2003, Colliers’ board of directors decided to formalize its search
    for fresh capital.  On the advice of an independent directors’
    committee established for that purpose, Colliers retained William Blair &amp;
    Company in early December to advise it in that regard.  The board appointed
    a Special Committee, chaired by Paul Echenberg, to work with William Blair
    and to develop proposals for the recapitalization of Colliers.  The Special
    Committee and William Blair embarked upon a conventional approach to raising
    capital.  They sent out “teaser” information packages to about 170 potentially
    interested parties.  They received about 30 expressions of interest, reduced
    to 7 who forwarded non-binding preliminary letters of interest by mid-June
    2004.  Those 7 were then provided with further detailed information, subject
    to confidentiality agreements, and were invited to meet with management and
    conduct further due diligence.  Only FirstService Corporation responded further
    and eventually, in October 2004, agreed to acquire 70% of the shares of Colliers
    at a price of US$10.06 per share through a court-approved Plan of Arrangement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Not
    surprisingly, the price of US$10.06 per share caught the appellant’s attention.  He
    now says that he was “stone walled” by Mr. Echenberg, who refused to provide
    him with any information about the details of the recapitalization process,
    and that he was induced to settle his lawsuit by the misrepresentations of
    Messrs. Cowie and Frye outlined above.  He maintains that, had he known there
    was a potential control transaction in the making, he would not have settled
    but would have maintained his 2002 action, gone to trial as scheduled, and
    simply amended his claim to assert a right to a price of US$10.06 per share,
    rather than the US$5.21 he claimed.  On what basis he would have been permitted
    to do this, he does not say.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    its part, Colliers says that the appellant’s outstanding lawsuit was viewed
    as an impediment to the recapitalization efforts and needed to be settled
    in order to pave the way for a resolution of its liquidity and other financial
    problems.  Douglas Frye testified that the appellant was made aware of these
    concerns.  Indeed, the members of Colliers’ senior management team agreed
    at the time – reluctantly – to the risky step of extending personal guarantees
    of $1,000,000.  On the basis of those personal guarantees, Colliers’
    lenders agreed to extend credit in the amount of $3,000,000 that would permit
    the Company to pay out the appellant and other departed shareholders who
    were entitled to be paid out before him (based on their retirement date).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was aware prior to and during the period of settlement negotiations
    that the Special Committee and William Blair were preparing to go to the
    market to determine the best way to raise capital.  The trial judge found
    as a fact (at para. 31) that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The plaintiff [the appellant] was kept informed
    by the defendant [Colliers] of the financial exigencies under which the defendant
    was operating and of the steps taken by the defendant to mitigate those circumstances.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The plaintiff was aware that funding the repurchase
    of shareholders’ shares was only one of the objectives of the defendants’
    search for funding, and that a “liquidity event” <i>or sale of the company</i> were
    possible outcomes of the search for financing….  The plaintiff was fixed
    with that knowledge, at least as of … October 10, 2001. [References to trial
    exhibits omitted; emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    record, including the cross-examination of Mr. White, clearly supports these
    findings.  Moreover, the fact that the appellant was aware Colliers’ recapitalization
    efforts might result in a change of control transaction is evidenced by his
    negotiation of the acceleration clause in the promissory notes taken as part
    of the settlement.  The notes provided that all sums were to become due and
    payable in the event of default.  An “Event of Default” was defined to include:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(e)    a cash offer for the purchase of all the
    then issued and outstanding shares in the capital of [Colliers] is accepted
    by shareholders of [Colliers] holding in excess of 75% of such shares.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant acknowledged that he attempted to negotiate a lower threshold of
    40% as a trigger for the acceleration clause in order to protect himself
    against “a possible Change of Control transaction” and that he could have
    sought other forms of protection (e.g., a percentage of any increase in the
    share price in the event of such a transaction), but did not do so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    evidence is also clear that during the settlement negotiations, the parties
    proceeded on the understanding that the appellant’s share price was fixed
    at US$5.21 per share.  This, notwithstanding the appellant’s testimony that
    he was aware at the time of the settlement that by then the value of the
    shares had increased to US$5.95 per share. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    his examination for discovery, the appellant said that the events relating
    to the recapitalization of Colliers during the Spring of 2004 were not relevant
    to the determination of his share price.  At trial he changed this testimony.  The
    following exchange took place during his cross-examination at trial:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>And
    if you look at question 82 [of the examination for discovery], it states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>QUESTION: And you knew what was happening in 2004
    wasn’t relevant to the price you were entitled to on your Shareholder Agreement,
    correct?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>ANSWER:  Correct.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Were you asked that question and did you give that

    you didn’t answer truthfully on your discovery?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I

    back to this.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I’m
    sorry, this is your examination for discovery in this suit, Mr. White, you
    appreciate that?</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Correct.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Then
    I didn’t understand your answer, I’m sorry?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A.        Well, I probably didn’t express myself
    correctly.  <i>I didn’t understand the implications of the question when
    it was asked</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge made no specific findings with respect to this evidence or with
    respect to the alleged misrepresentations attributed to Messrs. Cowie and
    Frye.  Nonetheless, he clearly and specifically rejected the appellant’s
    contention at trial “that [Colliers] saw on the horizon a potentially rich
    pay day, a prospect it failed to disclose to the plaintiff, and they were
    anxious to be rid of the plaintiff’s claim.”  He recited the defendant’s
    counter arguments and then concluded, at para. 47:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Given all the circumstances in this case, I find
    much more compelling the argument of the defendant than that of the plaintiff
    concerning the defendant’s motivation for settling the plaintiff’s action
    when it did.  <i>The stench I have been invited by counsel for the plaintiff
    to import to the defendant’s conduct is not, in my opinion warranted</i>.  On
    the contrary, the conduct bore the hallmark of good business decisions.  <i>Were
    that not the case, the plaintiff’s contention would be much more deserving
    of credit</i>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>III.       ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    are four primary reasons why, in my view, the appeal cannot succeed.  First,
    the trial judge’s findings, cited above, effectively negative the making
    of the misrepresentations alleged.  More importantly, however, even if the
    misrepresentations were made by Messrs. Cowie and Frye as alleged, they were
    immaterial to the value of the appellant’s shares, and cannot form the basis
    of an action in misrepresentation because it was unreasonable for him to
    rely on them in the circumstances.  Secondly, there was no detrimental reliance
    on the alleged misrepresentations in any event, even if they were made, since
    no damages flowed from them.  Thirdly, the appellant’s argument that, as
    a shareholder, he was entitled to be treated equally with other shareholders – including
    some other departing shareholders –
    who received the US$10.06 price paid by FirstService in the control transaction,
    has no merit in the circumstances of this case.  Finally, the Release executed
    by the appellant is a bar to the 2005 Lawsuit and no attempt is made to set
    it or the settlement aside.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Law</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Supreme Court of Canada has stated the requirements for the tort of negligent
    misrepresentation in <i>Queen v. Cognos Inc.</i>, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 87, at
    p. 110, as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The required elements for a successful <i>Hedley
      Byrne</i> claim have been stated in many authorities, sometimes in varying
      forms.  The decisions of this Court cited above suggest five general requirements:
      (1) there must be a duty of care based on a “special relationship” between
      the representor and the representee; (2) the representation in question
      must be untrue, inaccurate, or misleading; (3) the representor must have
      acted negligently in making said misrepresentation; (4) the representee
      must have relied, in a reasonable manner, on said negligent misrepresentation;
      and (5) the reliance must have been detrimental to the representee in the
      sense that damages resulted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    that I would simply add that to succeed in a negligent misrepresentation
    claim, a plaintiff must prove that the misrepresentation was material in
    the sense that it would be likely to influence the conduct of the plaintiff
    or would be likely to operate upon his judgment: <i>Humbruff v. Ontario Municipal
    Employees Retirement Board</i> (2006), 78 O.R. (3d) 561 (C.A.) at paras.

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Even if the Representations Were Made, They Were Not Material</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
    if the representations put forward at trial and on appeal were made, they
    could not have materially affected the price of the appellant’s shares, and
    he could not reasonably have relied on them.  Accordingly, they were not
    actionable.</p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'><span
 style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></span></u></h3>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>Whether the Representations Were Made</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge made no explicit finding about whether the alleged representations
    attributed to Messrs. Cowie and Frye were in fact made.  However, his rejection
    of the appellant’s contention that Colliers was acting improperly in hastily
    pressuring the appellant to settle, and his findings that the appellant was
    kept apprised of the steps being taken by Colliers to mitigate its financial
    problems and that the appellant knew “that a ‘liquidity event’ or a sale
    of the company were possible outcomes of the search for financing” – all
    imply that he rejected the appellant’s allegations in this respect.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    was ample evidence in the record to justify his doing so.  For example, the
    specific representations the appellant said at trial he relied on – and continues
    to pursue on appeal – were neither pleaded nor mentioned on discovery or
    at any time prior to trial.  When asked on discovery what was discussed with
    Mr. Cowie, the appellant was silent about any representation to the effect
    that nothing was happening in the Company that would affect the value of
    his shares.  The representation pleaded was based on Colliers’ alleged omission
    to inform him that Colliers was looking to recapitalize itself and, to that
    end, had formed a Special Committee and retained William Blair.  At trial,
    the appellant conceded that he was aware of these facts at the material times.  He
    also alleged in his Reply to Demand for Particulars of the misrepresentations
    alleged that during the settlement negotiations he asked Douglas Frye “about
    the company, what it was doing and in what direction it was heading,” and
    that Mr. Frye responded that “the company was continuing to operate as usual
    and that HSBC had relented after a number of years and was making monies
    available to fund the purchases of inactive shareholders.”  These answers,
    if given, were true.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the end, the appellant failed to prove any of the alleged misrepresentations
    pleaded or referred to on his examination for discovery.  Mr. Frye testified
    that the appellant did not make the alleged inquiry of him, but was solely
    concerned with getting his share price of US$5.21.  The appellant, himself,
    acknowledged that his objective at that time was to get the money as soon
    as he could.</p>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'><span
 style='text-decoration:none'>&nbsp;</span></span></u></h3>
  <h3><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>Whether the Representations Were Material</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    even if the representations attributed to Messrs. Cowie and Frye were made,
    they could not have affected the amount that the appellant was entitled to
    receive – and that Colliers was required to pay –
    for his shares.  As the trial judge found, the relationship between the appellant
    and Colliers at the time of the settlement negotiations was that of debtor
    and creditor.  He correctly concluded (at para. 32) that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The plaintiff’s entitlements at the time of the
    termination of his association with the defendant were crystallized in an
    agreement between the parties.  An essential term of the agreement was an
    agreement on the value to be assigned to the plaintiff’s shares; namely $5.21
    per share.  The effect of that agreement was to freeze the value of the shares
    and to create a debt obligation on the part of the defendant. … The plaintiff,
    by virtue of the contract forming the basis of his November 27, 2002 action,
    was insulated from the vicissitudes of the company’s fortunes …</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    short, his employment having been terminated, the appellant was contractually
    bound to sell his shares to Colliers, and Colliers was contractually bound
    to purchase those shares at a formula-fixed price that both parties accept
    was US$5.21 per share.  The effect of the Shareholders’ Agreement and the
    Retirement Agreement in December 2000 and March 2001 was to crystallize those
    rights and obligations.  As a result the appellant had no right to receive
    anything more (nor was he obliged to accept anything less)  than US$5.21
    for his shares, whether the share value changed as a result of market forces,
    a financial restructuring or a sale of the company and/or a change in control.  As
    the trial judge noted, the appellant “was insulated from the vicissitudes
    of the company’s fortunes”.  Although he technically remained a shareholder,
    the 400,050 shares were no longer his to sell.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    the appellant expected and anticipated nothing less.  He acknowledged that
    he knew the market value of the shares had increased to US$5.95 per share
    when he agreed to the settlement.  That change did not matter.  Why, if his
    theory is correct?    The appellant was insistent during a period when the
    Company’s shares fell below US$5.21 in value that he had a deal at that price.  As
    noted above, when the 2002 Lawsuit was launched in November of that year,
    the value of Colliers’ shares had dropped to $3.00 per share.  The appellant
    acknowledged that what he sued for, effectively, “was that $5.21
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      U.S.</st1:country-region>
    per share plus interest on it from the date [he] felt [he] should have been
    first paid.”  Earlier, on August 30, 2002, Mr. Lenczner had written to Mr.
    Frye on the appellant’s behalf, insisting that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Whatever may be the situation with other shareholders,
    it does not apply to Mr. White.  <i>We expect the company to honour its agreement</i> and
    to provide the payments set forth in our letter of July 8, 2002.  [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the appellant conceded that at the time of the settlement negotiations the
    issue was whether, and how soon, he would get his US$5.21.  The following
    exchange took place during his cross-examination:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>Q.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>… Based
    on everything you’ve told me, Mr. White, I suggest to you it wouldn’t make
    the slightest difference to you whether or not some of the shares of Colliers
    were sold, 70 per cent of them or all of them, so long as you got your $5.21,
    isn’t that right?</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You’ve
    made that point a number of times before.</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>Q.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But
    that’s right, [isn’t] it?</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That’s
    obviously what my interest was in the fact that I initiated a lawsuit.</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>Q.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>So
    whether or not there’s an expressed reference to the possibility of a sale
    of control, that’s not the issue here is it?  The issue for you at this time
    is whether or not …?</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    became the issue, didn’t it?</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>Q.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You
    don’t get to ask the questions.</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>A.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    beg your pardon?</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>Q.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>You
    don’t get to ask questions sorry, Mr. White.  <i>The issue at this time was
    whether or not you’d get your $5.21 and how soon you could get your hands
    on it?</i></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>A.        <i>That is correct.</i>  [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
    after learning about the FirstService transaction in October, 2004, the appellant’s
    major concern was whether the “change of control” acceleration provision
    in his promissory notes had been triggered entitling him to receive the balance
    owing to him under the settlement in one lump sum out of the closing funds.  In
    an e-mail sent to Colliers on November 1, 2004, the question he posed was: “My
    question is that I assume the outstanding balance owing me for the sale of
    my shares will be paid at the closing of the sale of [Colliers] to FirstService.  Please
    confirm.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the end, the fact that Colliers had launched a search for new financing that
    ultimately led to the acquisition of 70% of its shares by FirstService at
    a price of US$10.06 per share was irrelevant to the resolution of the appellant’s
    lawsuit and he could not reasonably have relied upon any representation to
    that effect to decline to settle: <i>Queen v. Cognos</i>, at p. 110 (requirement
    #4).  The representations, if made, were not actionable.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>No Detrimental Reliance or Damages</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Additionally,
    for a representation to be actionable, damages must result from relying on
    it: <i>Queen v. Cognos</i>, at p. 110 (requirement #5).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,
    for much the same reasons as those outlined in the preceding section of these
    reasons, the appellant has not established that he sustained any damages
    as a result of the alleged misrepresentations.  He was contractually bound
    to sell his shares <i>upon the termination</i> of his employment (whether
    voluntary or otherwise) at the price fixed by the formula for the valuation
    of the company shares in the Shareholders’ Agreement.  Although the appellant
    casually maintains that, had he known about the potential control transaction,
    he would simply have declined to settle, gone to trial in November 2004,
    and amended to claim his US$10.06 per share like any other shareholder, I
    am at a loss to understand on what legal basis he would have been permitted
    to do so.  He is not like any other shareholder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    this was so is confirmed by the negotiations leading up to the Retirement
    Agreement.  Colliers’ representatives urged the appellant to consider the
    option of leaving a portion of his shareholdings in the company (thereby
    reducing the company’s buy-out obligation at that time).  In a letter dated
    August 12, 2001, Mr. McLernon put forward the following as one of two sets
    of alternatives for the repurchase of the appellant’s shares:<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Repurchase 75%-80% of your shares at $5.21 per
    share in 5 equal payments over four years <i>with the balance left in the
    firm with the same rights and privileges of other common shareholders</i>.  Interest
    would be payable as above.  Any shares left in the firm will be subject to
    an amended Shareholders’ Agreement that limits future share repurchases.  There
    is, however, a specific liquidity plan in four years’ time (sooner depending
    on market conditions) <i>in which all common shareholders will have the opportunity
    to sell.</i> [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> The
    appellant declined this alternative because he wished to have his money to
    be able to plan for his full retirement and for other personal reasons.  It
    follows from this refusal, however, that he understood the shares he sold
    back to Colliers would not be subject to “the same rights and privileges
    of other common shareholders.”  It is also of peripheral interest, at any
    rate, that he declined this alternative in the face of discussions with Mr.
    McLernon and others to the effect that the value of Colliers’ shares might
    increase to between $7 and $15-$20 over the next few years.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    there is simply no basis for concluding on this record that the FirstService
    transaction – or any other transaction –
    would have been completed had the appellant’s 2002 Lawsuit not been settled
    and the situation respecting the buy-out of his shares resolved.  As noted
    above, Colliers’ senior management considered the 2002 Lawsuit to be an impediment
    to the company’s restructuring efforts.  Mr. Frye considered it “a road block” and
    felt that they “were not going to be successful” in doing a recapitalization “with
    a lawsuit hanging over [their] head.”  FirstService’s preliminary letter
    of interest, submitted on June 17, 2004, stipulated that “The amounts owing
    to departed shareholders will be settled prior to the Closing Date or reserved
    for out of the closing funds and will be paid in accordance with their terms.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    fact that the FirstService transaction ultimately contained a provision calling
    for the then non-active shareholders to be paid out at US$10.06 per share
    is not determinative.  Whatever practical and tactical decisions the Colliers’ board
    of directors may have made to facilitate the completion of the transaction
    has nothing to do with the legal rights and obligations of the appellant.  To
    repeat what the appellant’s counsel said in his letter to Colliers dated
    August 30, 2002, “[w]hatever may be the situation with other shareholders,
    it does not apply to Mr. White.”  Nor can it be assumed that Colliers would
    have made the same decision to pay the other non-active shareholders on a
    basis different than that provided for in the Shareholders’ Agreement if
    the appellant’s shares had remained in the mix.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Non-Equal Treatment as a Shareholder</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Lenczner submits that the appellant is entitled to be paid for his shares
    on the same basis as the other non-active shareholders on the principle that
    all shareholders of the same class are to be treated equally.  This argument
    does not assist the appellant in the circumstances of this case, however,
    for essentially the same reasons as I have just articulated.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>From
    a legal perspective, the appellant is not in the same position as other common
    shareholders of his class.  We do not even know if he is in the same position
    as other non-active shareholders (whether ahead of him or behind him in the
    queue) because his Retirement Agreement – as he stresses – has some different
    nuances from a strict application of the Shareholders’
    Agreement.  It binds him in a debtor/creditor relationship, in any event,
    to sell his shares to Colliers at the US$5.21 price and neither permits him
    to benefit from “the same rights and privileges of other common shareholders” (to
    adopt the language of the pre-Retirement Agreement negotiations) nor exposes
    him to “the vicissitudes of the company’s fortunes” (to adopt the language
    of the trial judge).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    common law recognizes a presumption of equality amongst shares and the right
    of shareholders to participate in the benefits of membership equally: <i>McClurg
    v. Canada</i>, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 1020.  The common law rule is carried forward
    in statutory form in the <i>Canada Business Corporations Act</i>, R.S.C.
    1985, c. C-44, s. 24, and its various provincial counterparts: see e.g. <i>Business
    Corporations Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. B.16, s. 22.  These statutes stipulate
    that where a corporation has only one class of shares, the rights of the
    holders of those shares are to be equal in all respects.  However, while
    shareholders within the same class are required to be treated proportionately
    and equally, they do not necessarily have to be dealt with in the same fashion.  Different
    treatment is acceptable, so long as it is justifiable and not disproportionate
    and unequal: see e.g. <i>St.
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    Lawrence &amp;
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Hudson Railway
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Co. (Re)</i>, [1998] O.J. No. 3934 (Gen. Div.), at paras. 36-37.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,
    the different treatment of the appellant is justified, from a legal perspective,
    and not disproportionate or unequal, because of the benefits of the Shareholders’ Agreement
    and the Retirement Agreement to which the appellant freely subscribed.  That
    there may be a downside to his having done so is not material.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Release is a Bar</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge was correct in holding that the Full and Final Release executed
    by the appellant as part of the settlement in June, 2004 is a complete bar
    to the 2005 action.  It was, as he said, “couched in the broadest of language”,
    and full and final releases are not a matter of mere formality.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Kingu
      v. Walmar Ventures Ltd</i>. (1986), 10 B.C.L.R. (2d) 15 (C.A.), at pp.
      20-21, McLachlin J.A. set out a series of eight criteria on the basis of
      which a contract may be rescinded for non-fraudulent misrepresentation:
      see also <i>Brideau et al. v. Gravel</i> (1969), 1 N.B.R. (2d) 372 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  <i>Kingu</i> has been referred to in at least two authorities in this
    Court, but not in the context of an attempt to set aside a release and a
    settlement agreement:  see <i>Boulanger v. Johnson &amp; Johnson Corp</i>.
    (2003), 174 O.A.C. 44, at para. 19; <i>Samson v. Lockwood</i> (1999), 40
    O.R. (3d) 161 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), at p. 172.  Indeed, in the only Ontario authority that appears to have
    dealt with the release/settlement agreement issue directly, however, the
    trial judge refused to set aside a release notwithstanding that he found
    there had been a negligent misrepresentation: <i>Francis v. Dingman</i> (1981),
    15 B.L.R. 190 (H.C.).  The decision was overturned on appeal, but on the
    basis that this Court found the misrepresentation to have been fraudulent
    rather than negligent: (1983), 43 O.R. (2d) 641.  The Court of Appeal took
    no issue with the trial judge’s refusal to set aside the release on the basis
    of a negligent misrepresentation.  <i>Francis v. Dingman</i> preceded <i>Kingu</i>,
    however.  Thus, there may be circumstances in which a release – and the contract
    underlying it (i.e., the settlement agreement) – could be set aside on the
    basis of a non-fraudulent misrepresentation.  It is not necessary to resolve
    that issue here, though, because this is not such a case in any event.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    say this for the principal reason that, even though there may be cases where
    a release can be set aside on the basis that it has been induced by a misrepresentation,
    the appellant did not claim rescission of the settlement agreement or of
    the Release in the action.  He sought damages predicated on breach of contract,
    breach of fiduciary duty and misrepresentation.  Nor does an attack on the
    Release form a ground of appeal.  He argues on the appeal, nonetheless, that
    the release should be set aside on the basis of the misrepresentations discussed
    above.  Leaving aside my conclusion that the alleged misrepresentations – even
    if made – were not actionable in the circumstances, I would not give effect
    to this submission. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s actions have affirmed, and continue to affirm, the settlement
    agreement.  He accepted the initial payment of $500,000 on account of his
    shares, and has insisted upon receiving – and has received – the annual instalment
    payments due under the promissory note.  In addition, he has received and
    accepted the additional payment of $150,000.  No suggestion has been made
    that he is willing to return those funds or even that he is willing to take
    back the shares that he transferred as part of the settlement.  Colliers
    has fully performed the settlement.  The appellant cannot have it both ways:  he
    cannot take the benefit of all of the provisions in the settlement agreement
    favouring him, and at the same time seek to set aside the Release favouring
    Colliers which clearly formed an integral part of the settlement.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The Reasons are Adequate</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the appellant submits that the trial judge's reasons are so opaque that no
    reviewing court can comprehend how the issue was addressed:  <i>R. v. Sheppard</i>,
    [2002] 1 S.C.R. 869.  I disagree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the trial judge did not specifically refer to <i>Queen v. Cognos</i>, he
    nonetheless addressed his mind to the appellant's misrepresentation claim.  He
    was clearly alive to all of the evidence, including the evidence impugning
    Colliers’ motivation and the evidence concerning the alleged failure to disclose
    the details of on-going negotiations.  At para. 16 of his reasons, the trial
    judge identified the appellant’s position, accurately, as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>That position is that he sought information from
    company officials concerning what was happening in respect to the company’s
    quest for financing, <i>and, in particular, was anything happening that might
    affect the value of the company’s shares</i>.  According to the plaintiff,
    he was led to believe that the company was not for sale, or, in other words,
    a control transaction was not contemplated.  Had he been told otherwise,
    the plaintiff maintains, he would, or, at least, may have held on to his
    shares pending the company finding a suitable financial partner, with the
    attendant prospects of obtaining more than the agreed upon $5.21 per share.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    he specifically touched on the allegation that the appellant had been told
    the company was not for sale (an allegation he rejected) and thus again,
    at least implicitly, on the allegation that he had been told nothing was
    happening that would affect the value of the company's shares.  When that
    trial judge’s reasons are read as a whole, they show:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>a)  that he concluded the relationship between
    the appellant and Colliers was that of debtor-creditor as of the date of
    the Settlement Agreement;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>b)   that he found that Colliers had no duty to
    disclose the details of any on-going negotiations respecting its search for
    refinancing;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>c)   that he did not accept the claim that Colliers
    had failed to inform the appellant of the details of &quot;what was going
    on&quot; and that the appellant did not know the company was for sale must
    be rejected; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>d)   that he did not accept the appellant's contention
    that Colliers failed to disclose the prospect of a &quot;potentially rich
    payday&quot; to the appellant in order to pressure him into settling the
    2002 Lawsuit hastily.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    this basis, the reasons make it clear that a claim for negligent misrepresentation
    had not been made out on any of the following grounds: (i) the requisite
    duty of care between the parties did not exist in the circumstances; (ii)
    the alleged misrepresentations had not been made or, (iii) if they had been
    made, the debtor-creditor relationship rendered them immaterial.  The claim
    was properly rejected on any or all of these grounds, in my view.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Costs</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant filed a supplemental notice of appeal attacking the trial judge's
    disposition as to costs on a substantial indemnity basis.  Mr. Lenczner did
    not address this issue either in his factum or in oral argument.  It is therefore
    unnecessary to deal with it, but I would reject this ground of appeal in
    any event.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge based his decision primarily on the language of the Full and
    Final Release executed by the appellant as part of the settlement.  The Release
    provided that if the appellant commenced an action to which it applied – which
    the trial judge had found to be the case – “and the Releasees (or any of
    them) [were] added to such proceeding in any manner whatsoever, whether justified
    in law or not … [the appellant] will be jointly and severally liable to the
    Releasees for the legal costs incurred in any such proceeding, on a solicitor
    and his own client scale.&quot;  The trial judge viewed this as a solemn
    agreement. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    was open to the trial judge to arrive at this disposition, and I see no basis
    for interfering with his decision in this regard.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>IV.       DISPOSITION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the foregoing reasons I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent is entitled to its costs of the appeal fixed in the amount of
    $10,000.00 all inclusive.</p>
