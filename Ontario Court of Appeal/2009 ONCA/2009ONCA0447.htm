  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    September 5, 2002, the appellant John Bull was seriously injured when his
    vehicle was rear ended by a vehicle driven by the respondent Jim Turchinetz.  On
    November 14, 2007, after a 15-day trial, the jury found that there was no
    negligence on the part of either person which caused or contributed to the
    accident. The appellant’s action was therefore dismissed.  The jury assessed
    the appellant’s general damages at $10,000.00, his past loss of income at
    $14,500.00, and his future loss of income at zero.  The appellant appeals
    both liability and damages.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>LIABILITY</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Appellant’s
      counsel, who was not trial counsel, candidly acknowledged that there was
      evidence at trial sufficient to properly sustain the jury’s findings. In
      particular, he acknowledged the evidence that a blue car driven by an unknown
      driver cut in front of the appellant forcing both him and the respondent
      to slam on their brakes suddenly, and that this caused the accident.  In
      this court, the appellant argued that these facts had not been pleaded
      by the respondent with the result that this evidence should have been excluded
      or the trial judge should have told the jury to disregard it and find that
      fault for the accident lay with either the appellant or the respondent
      or both, but could not be found to lie with an unknown driver.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
      disagree.  The position of the respondent at trial was that he was not
      negligent in any way, as the collision was caused entirely by the actions
      of the blue car. This was put to the jury as his position in the trial
      judge’s charge.  The evidence to support this position came from the respondent,
      and would undoubtedly have been known to the appellant from at least the
      time of discovery onward. It went in at trial without objection from appellant’s
      counsel, who made no request of the trial judge to direct the jury to disregard
      the evidence.  Neither counsel had any objections to the charge.  This
      was not a trial by ambush.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
      the basis of this evidence, it was entirely open to the respondent to take
      the position that he was not negligent and that the collision was caused
      by the actions of the blue car.  The jury’s finding that there was no negligence
      by the respondent which caused or contributed to the accident was neither
      perverse nor the product of any legal error by the trial judge.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      liability appeal fails.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>DAMAGES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Counsel
      for the appellant candidly acknowledged that the assessment of general
      damages is defensible on the evidence, although at the low end of the range.
      I agree.  The trial judge suggested a range of $10,000 to $25,000 if the
      jury found the pain and suffering from the accident to be limited to soft
      tissue injuries now  healed. That appears to be the view the jury took.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However,
      the appellant does contest the assessments of past and future income loss.  In
      my view they are also defensible and do not represent perverse findings.
      They would seem to rest at least in part on the same premise – that the
      injuries due to the accident were soft tissue injuries and were healed
      by the time of the trial.  There was ample evidence on which these assessments
      could be properly based.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      damage appeal also must fail.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      the result, the appeal is dismissed.  Costs to the respondent fixed at
      $15,000 inclusive of disbursements and GST.</span></p>
