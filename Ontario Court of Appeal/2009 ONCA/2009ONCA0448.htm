  <h4><span lang=EN-US>I.          INTRODUCTION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    primary issue in this appeal involves damages for housekeeping losses in
    a personal injury action.  In this case, the jury awarded the respondent,
    Claudia McIntyre, damages that included an award for “past housekeeping inefficiency” and
    for past and future “lost housekeeping capacity”.  While courts in this and
    other jurisdictions have allowed damages for housekeeping losses, this case
    presents an opportunity for this court to consider certain aspects of such
    awards. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal.   </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>II.        BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%;'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    April 23, 2000, the respondent was a passenger in a vehicle driven by Alan
    McIntyre, with whom she was living and whom she subsequently married.  The
    McIntyre vehicle collided with a car driven by the appellant, Shaun Docherty,
    and owned by the appellant, James Docherty.  As a result of the accident,
    Ms. McIntyre suffers from chronic pain, fibromyalgia, depression and anxiety.  In
    the ensuing action, her claim against her husband was dismissed.  The appellants
    admitted liability.  Damages were the only issue at trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%;'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%;font-family:Times;
'>Before the accident, the respondent intended to pursue a career as</span> a
    bookkeeper.  She worked on a full-time basis at various jobs, earning between
    $7.50 and $14.00 hourly.  In addition to her work outside the home, the respondent,
    whose family members described her as a
    “clean freak” or a “neat freak”, did the bulk of the housework.  Her housekeeping
    included all the cooking, vacuuming, dishwashing, cleaning, laundry, bed-making
    and gardening.  Her husband assisted with other tasks, such as taking out
    the garbage, cleaning windows and heavier chores.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%;'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    the accident, the respondent experienced pain daily.  <span style='line-height:200%;font-family:Times;
'>At trial, the respondent testified that, if she paced herself carefully, </span>with
    pain, <span style='line-height:200%;font-family:Times;
'>s</span>he could undertake most of her housekeeping responsibilities.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  For the balance of those responsibilities, the
    respondent relied on gratuitous housekeeping provided by her family, including
    her husband, mother and two sisters.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the respondent returned to employment in 2003, initially on a part-time and
    later on a full-time basis, she found that her level of pain precluded full-time
    employment.  After her first maternity leave in 2003, the respondent returned
    to   seasonal employment with H&amp;R Block.  In 2005, she had a second child.  In
    2006, to accommodate their increasing needs, the McIntyre family moved to
    a larger home.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, the respondent estimated that she could work outside the home a maximum
    of 15 to 16 hours weekly.  She proposed starting a home-based business that
    would provide her with the flexibility to maximize the hours she could devote
    to income-earning activity.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:
200%;font-family:Times;'>At trial, the medical experts </span>disagreed about
    the respondent’s prognosis.  The respondent’s experts testified to the effect
    that she was already doing more than she should.  In contrast, the appellants’ expert
    testified that the respondent was largely independent in housekeeping<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a> and that she was able to return to full-time employment.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    facilitate a return to full-time work, the appellants’ expert recommended
    a course of Oxycontin, a long-acting opioid analgesic.  The experts expressed
    some disagreement regarding Oxycontin’s potential side effects, including
    its effect of dulling concentration.  Two of the respondent’s experts also
    expressed concern about the risk of addiction, while the appellants’ expert
    testified addiction was not a significant risk.  At trial, the appellants
    did not question the respondent about the possibility of treatment with Oxycontin.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An
    economist, Dr. Michael Charette, provided expert evidence for the respondent
    regarding the number of hours women on average, spend doing productive household
    activities and the value of such services.  To take into account the respondent’s
    post-accident life initially without and later with children, Dr. Charette
    averaged the general statistics for two families with two spouses working
    full-time, both with and without children.  In his opinion, a woman in such
    a position would spend 1,278 hours annually on household activities, including
    cleaning, cooking, laundry, home maintenance, shopping and child care.  With
    that figure, Dr. Charette provided the jury with calculations valuing the
    respondent’s housekeeping losses assuming the respondent suffered different
    degrees of impairment.  Based on the evidence, including Dr. Charette’s opinion,
    counsel for the respondent claimed a past housekeeping loss of $41,000 and
    a future housekeeping loss of $179,500.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants did not call an expert economist opinion at trial.  Instead, they
    took issue with the respondent’s expert evidence.  They also argued that
    any award for housekeeping losses should be restricted to non-pecuniary damages
    and that at least some of the respondent’s limitations did not arise from
    the accident, but from other stressors, including her post-accident increased
    housekeeping workload.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>III.       THE TRIAL </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    lengthy discussions with counsel about the proper approach to housekeeping
    losses, the trial judge instructed the jury that past housekeeping inefficiency
    damages relate to the respondent’s inability to perform her housekeeping
    functions as well as she could before the accident.  He told the jury that
    these damages, which were not capable of calculation, were more in the nature
    of general (non-pecuniary) damages<a href="#_ftn3"
name="_ftnref3" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[3]</span></span></span></a> and advised that any award should be modest.  The
    trial judge reminded the jury that the respondent’s counsel suggested an “inefficiency” award
    between $10,000 and $15,000, while the appellants took the position that
    any award for this loss should simply be included as a component of general
    (non-pecuniary) damages.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge explained to the jury that the respondent claimed $41,000 for
    past lost housekeeping as an “actual amount” for housekeeping that the respondent
    had performed pre-accident, but that since the accident had been performed
    for her by her family members.  The trial judge referred to the respondent’s
    statement that she could do about two-thirds of the housework, but not as
    well, and pointed to the Dr. Charette’s economic evidence.  In addition to
    other percentages, his  report showed, if the jury found a 10% housekeeping
    impairment, that would result in a past loss to the respondent of $12,524
    and a 20% impairment would result in a loss of $25,049.  In accordance with
    the respondent’s position, the trial judge instructed the jury that any award
    for past lost housekeeping was subject to a deduction of the amount of the
    award for past housekeeping inefficiency.  The trial judge also explained
    to the jury the appellants’ position that past housekeeping losses should
    simply be a component of general (non-pecuniary) damages.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Regarding
    future lost housekeeping damages, the trial judge put the respondent’s position
    to the jury that this award should be in the range of $179,500, as well as
    the appellants’ position that the respondent should only receive a nominal
    award sufficient to provide her with a housekeeper one day a week for the
    next two or three years.  He again referred to Dr. Charette’s evidence and
    to the evidence about the respondent’s prognosis as well as to evidence that
    her housekeeping responsibilities would decrease as her children grew older.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:
200%'>After hearing counsel’s objections to the charge, the trial judge re-charged
      the jury.  In doing so, he explained the position of counsel for the respondent
      that housekeeping inefficiency damages should be a separate award from
      general (non-pecuniary) damages and that any such award would be deducted
      from the amount awarded for past lost housekeeping.  The trial judge explained
      the appellants’ position that general (non-pecuniary) damages, including
      any damages for housekeeping inefficiency and past lost housekeeping, should
      not exceed a total of $100,000.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Several
    hours after the resumption of deliberations, the jury asked the trial judge
    to “explain the relationship between past housekeeping inefficiency damages
    and past lost housekeeping capacity.”  The trial judge observed that the
    jury’s confusion was not surprising.  In response to the question, he told
    the jury that the respondent should not be compensated twice.  They could
    award a modest sum for past housekeeping inefficiency, but the amount of
    such an award was to be deducted from any award for past lost housekeeping.
    He reminded the jury that “past lost housekeeping” was the work the respondent
    could no longer do that her family did for her.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN>The
      trial judge also informed the jury, in his initial charge, of the ranges
      proposed by the parties for non-pecuniary damages. He reminded the jury
      that the respondent proposed a range between $90,000 and $105,000 (plus
      inefficiency damages), and that the appellants suggested a range between
      $75,000 and $100,000. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    provide perspective regarding the housekeeping issues raised in this case,
    it is helpful to begin by examining the scenarios in which housekeeping losses
    arise, reviewing the parties’ arguments on the facts of this case, and considering
    the current approach to the categorization of damages generally and housekeeping
    losses particularly.  Arising from that examination, I will comment on some
    specific issues raised by the trial judge’s charge in this case.  I will
    then turn to consider the issues that arise regarding pecuniary and non-pecuniary
    housekeeping losses in the context of the three scenarios of pre-trial housekeeping
    left undone, pre-trial housekeeping performed inefficiently and pre-trial
    housekeeping undertaken by third parties.  </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Different
    housekeeping losses may arise in different scenarios.  In some households,
    the injured plaintiff may have been a full-time or sole homemaker whose work
    permitted a spouse or partner to maintain employment outside the home.  In
    other households, the plaintiff may also have worked outside the home and
    shared responsibilities for housekeeping with other family members.  In one-person
    households, the plaintiff may have been responsible for both housekeeping
    and outside employment.  </p>

      the household circumstances, an injured plaintiff will cope in one or more
      of the following three ways.  First, the plaintiff may leave some or all
      of the housekeeping undone.  Second, the plaintiff may perform some or
      all of the housekeeping functions, but with increased pain and decreased
      efficiency.  Third, the plaintiff may rely on paid or unpaid third parties
      on a part or full-time basis to perform some or all of the housekeeping. </span><b><i></i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(2)       The Parties’ Arguments about Housekeeping  </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the respondent’s claim was argued on the basis of housekeeping
    performed inefficiently and housekeeping undertaken by third parties.  The
    appellants do not take issue with the amount of the jury award of $5,000
    for housekeeping inefficiency, but argue that it should have been included
    as part of non-pecuniary damages for pain and suffering, and not treated
    as a separate head of damages.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants challenge the $10,400 jury award for past lost housekeeping, arguing
    that any loss was non-pecuniary and that the respondent suffered no compensable
    pecuniary loss since her family members undertook the necessary housekeeping
    without compensation.  The appellants also argue that past housekeeping losses
    are only compensated when the third party undertakes the function full-time
    and beyond the usual parameters of what would normally be undertaken by a
    family member or a friend.  Finally, the appellants argue that an award for
    past housekeeping loss should not be available to the respondent because
    s. 61 of the <i>Family Law Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3 (“
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    FLA”) provides for an exclusive compensatory scheme to compensate family
    members, and the family members in this case made no such claim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    support of this position, the appellants rely on <i>Vykysaly v. Jablowski</i> (1992),
    8 O.R. (3d) 181 (Gen. Div.), where Somers J. denied the plaintiff any award
    for housekeeping losses, noting the availability of compensation under the
    FLA, his finding that housework was not the plaintiff’s “major economic contribution
    to this family”, and his view that domestic tasks should be shared equally. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the appellants challenge the jury’s $44,535 award for future lost housekeeping.  They
    argue that this award was not available in the absence of evidence that the
    respondent would in fact retain housekeepers.  As well, the appellants argue
    that the respondent’s expert economic evidence was inadequate to support
    the award because it addressed statistical averages without considering the
    actual needs of the plaintiff.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent argues that all the housekeeping awards were supported by the
    evidence and were in accord with the reasoning of the Saskatchewan Court
    of Appeal in <i>Fobel v. Dean </i>(1991), 83 D.L.R. (4th) 385, leave to appeal
    to S.C.C. refused, [1992] 1 S.C.R. vii, , which should be adopted by this
    court.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(3)       </span><span lang=EN-US>Categorization of Damages </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    view of the issues raised, it is helpful to be mindful of the basic principles
    that underpin the assessment of personal injury damages.  The bedrock principle
    is that damages serve the purpose of putting the plaintiff in the position
    she or he would have been in but for the injury.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    achieve this result, damages are categorized under separate headings.  This
    categorization provides a logical framework to assist in focusing attention
    on the nature and components of the claim, both for the purposes of the trial
    judge and jury, and also for the purpose of facilitating appellate review:
    see <i>Andrews v. Grand &amp; Toy Alberta Ltd.</i>, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 229,
    at pp. 235-6.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Damages
    are initially categorized as either special or general.  Special damages
    generally compensate a plaintiff for pre-trial pecuniary out-of-pocket or “positive”
    losses.  In contrast, general damages compensate for “negative” losses, which
    can include both pecuniary and non-pecuniary losses.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pecuniary
    damages are generally assessed on the basis of calculable losses for items
    such as the plaintiff’s prospective loss of earnings and profits and costs
    of future care, as well as other expenses.  In contrast, non-pecuniary damages
    cannot be arithmetically calculated because they compensate the plaintiff
    for intangible losses arising from physical and psychological pain and suffering
    as well as from any loss of amenities or expectations of life.  As Dickson
    J., writing for the court in <i>Andrews</i>, observed, at p. 264, the components
    of non-pecuniary damages necessarily “overlap and merge at the edges and
    in practice”, making it appropriate to arrive at<span lang=EN> a composite
    award for all non-pecuniary losses.  </span>Accordingly, rarely will <span
lang=EN>non-pecuniary damages be broken down into their components. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Traditionally,
    the various categories of damages include: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.         special damages (readily calculable
    pecuniary losses to trial)</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2.         general damages</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Absent
    from this categorization is any reference to housekeeping losses.  This is
    so because, historically, there was no recognition that any loss of housekeeping
    was suffered personally by the plaintiff.  Instead of a direct claim by the
    injured plaintiff for lost housekeeping, a claim was made by the injured
    wife’s husband for loss of <i>consortium</i> or <i>servitium</i>.  Claims
    for loss of <i>consortium</i>, based on the antiquated theory that it was
    the husband’s interests that were damaged as a result of the wife’s injuries,
    were abolished by s. 69(3) of the <i>Family Law Reform Act</i>, <i>1978</i>,
    S.O. 1978, c. 2.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    now turn to a review of the seminal English and Canadian decisions that initially
    categorized housekeeping losses for the purpose of the assessment of damages.<i></i></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(4)       Review of Case Law</span><i></i></h4>
  <h3><i>(i)        The English Position:  Daly v. General Steam Navigation Co.
      Ltd.</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge in <i>Daly v. General Steam Navigation Co</i>. <i>Ltd.,</i> [1979]
    1 Lloyd’s Rep. 257 (Q.B. (Adm. Ct.)), recognized, at p. 265, that Mrs. Daly
    was entitled to housekeeping damages because she “is just as much disabled
    from doing her unpaid job as an employed person is disabled from doing his
    paid one”.  Thus, <i>Daly</i> recognized that housekeeping losses are personal
    to the injured party.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Court of Appeal agreed with this principle and addressed the quantification
    of housekeeping damages: [1980] 3 All E.R. 696.  In the Court of Appeal’s
    view, at p. 701, the proper measure of future lost housekeeping is the cost
    of employing replacement domestic assistance.<a href="#_ftn4"
name="_ftnref4" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[4]</span></span></span></a>  The court further observed that the replacement
    cost approach applies whether the plaintiff will actually employ a housekeeper
    or whether she or he opts to struggle with the housekeeping and spend the
    award on otherwise unavailable luxuries.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge awarded Mrs. Daly £8,000 in non-pecuniary damages.  He observed
    that, apart from the limited help she received from members of her family,
    Mrs. Daly had not been able to employ a substitute housekeeper to the extent
    that she needed.  Since her sister-in-law was paid £633 for housework performed
    while Mrs. Daly was in the hospital, the trial judge included this amount
    in his award for special damages.  In the trial judge’s view, the balance
    of Mrs. Daly’s past housekeeping loss should be compensated in a manner similar
    to a claim for past loss of earnings.  Using this approach, and based on
    the number of hours that Mrs. Daly needed a replacement housekeeper each
    week before trial, the trial judge awarded pre-trial pecuniary damages of £2,691.  He
    also awarded damages for future lost housekeeping in the amount of
    £8,736.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the appeal court upheld the special damages for the sister-in-law’s substitute
    housework, it disagreed with the trial court’s award of pecuniary damages
    for past housekeeping inefficiency.  In the appeal court’s view, since Mrs.
    Daly did not hire a substitute housekeeper, she suffered no pecuniary loss.  Indeed,
    Bridge L.J. said that as a matter of
    “practical reality”, Mrs. Daly was “unable to say that she has incurred the
    cost of employing the labour” she needed, apart from the sister-in-law’s
    assistance.&nbsp;  What Mrs. Daly did, he said, was “manage as best she could” with&nbsp;some
    help provided by her husband and daughter.  What Mrs. Daly did, he said,
    was “manage as best she could”.  Consistent with the trial judge’s reasoning,
    he specifically rejected the argument of Mrs. Daly’s counsel that the trial
    judge’s pecuniary award of
    £2,691 was an evaluation of the actual work performed by the husband and
    daughter.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, the court concluded that the only loss Mrs. Daly suffered as
    a result of “managing the best she could” was in the nature of increased
    pain and suffering or the loss of an amenity of life, which was properly
    compensated as part of non-pecuniary rather than pecuniary damages.<a href="#_ftn5" name="_ftnref5" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[5]</span></span></span></a>  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nonetheless,
    Bridge L.J. tested the trial judge’s global award by observing that the trial
    judge could not have been faulted had he, in addition to damages for future
    housekeeping losses, awarded Mrs. Daly non-pecuniary damages of £10,000 (instead
    of the “rather parsimonious” amount of £8,000) and an additional £930 in
    special or pecuniary damages relating to her husband’s lost earnings, which
    were incurred because the husband took time from his part-time employment
    to perform housework.<a href="#_ftn6" name="_ftnref6" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[6]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    since the appeal court was not asked to increase the damages, Bridge L.J.
    upheld the trial award by removing the trial judge’s £2,691 in pecuniary
    damages for past housekeeping losses and adding the same amount to the trial
    judge’s £8,000 non-pecuniary award.  In this way, the total non-pecuniary
    award became £10,691.  However, from the
    £10,691 figure, Bridge L.J. deducted the £930 in special damages relating
    to the husband’s lost earnings.  By doing so, he ensured that Mrs. Daly would
    not receive double recovery for that amount.  In my view, Bridge L.J.’s method
    of calculation was not meant to establish a principled approach to calculating
    housekeeping damages, but rather to explain why he would uphold the global
    award.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, <i>Daly</i> concluded
    that both housework left undone because there was no substitute housekeeper
    and housework performed by the plaintiff inefficiently are properly compensated
    in non-pecuniary damages.  However, housework actually performed by another
    at a cost, such as that performed by the husband and the sister-in-law, is
    compensated as part of special damages.  </p>
  <h3><i>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></i><i>The

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>McCallum

      (4th) 49,</span> the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal<span style='line-height:200%;color:black'> confirmed
      the distinction </span>between a non-pecuniary award for a plaintiff’s
      personal discomfort in performing housekeeping and a pecuniary award for
      a plaintiff seeking compensation for the notional costs of a third person
      who actually performed the role of a substitute homemaker on an unpaid
      basis.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    year later, the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal revisited the quantification
    of housekeeping damages in the seminal decision of <i>Fobel v. Dean</i>.  In
    that case, there was evidence that Mrs. Fobel was able to perform approximately
    30 per cent of her housekeeping responsibilities in the period before trial
    with “diminished efficiency, pain and discomfort.”  The balance of her housekeeping
    tasks remained undone.  The trial judge awarded Mrs. Fobel a total of $60,000
    in non-pecuniary damages, which included damages for past loss of housekeeping.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Writing
    for the majority of the Court of Appeal, Vancise J.A. observed that, in the
    absence of replacement labour, it is wrong to evaluate a plaintiff’s past
    lost housekeeping by reference to replacement value.  In his view, where
    there is no replacement labour, the loss is properly compensated as a component
    of general non-pecuniary damages.  However, in determining the proper amount
    of this component of non-pecuniary damages, Vancise J.A. reasoned, at p.
    401, that replacement cost is a relevant factor.  In addition, to allow for
    proper appellate review, he stipulated that a trial judge ought to set out
    separately the amount of non-pecuniary damages that relate to this loss from
    the other non-pecuniary damages. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, the Court of Appeal allocated $45,000 for Mrs. Fobel’s general
    pain and suffering and loss of amenities, and a separate amount of $15,000
    for her non-pecuniary housekeeping damages.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, Vancise J.A. approached the pecuniary damage claim for future lost
    housekeeping by applying a replacement cost approach using a combination
    of the substitute homemaker and catalogue of services approaches that has
    been widely accepted by Canadian courts.<a href="#_ftn7" name="_ftnref7" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[7]</span></span></span></a>  This combined approach, which is not challenged
    in this case, catalogues the plaintiff’s housekeeping functions and then
    allocates those functions between direct labour (such as cooking and cleaning)
    and household management.  Each category is then quantified based on <span style='color:black'>“the
    community’s fair market salary of each occupation and totalled to arrive
    at a weekly salary.”  </span>Applying this approach, Vancise J.A. awarded
    the plaintiff approximately $80,000 for her pecuniary loss of future housekeeping.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    some variation, <i>Fobel</i> has been considered and applied in numerous
    cases in different provinces.  However, rather than treating replacement
    cost as merely one factor in determining the amount of the non-pecuniary
    loss, as a practical matter many cases appear to rely heavily or exclusively
    on replacement cost: see, for example, <i>Stehelin v. Rock</i>, [1993] Y.J.
    No. 198 (S.C.); <i>Boucher v. Doiron</i> (2000), 230 N.B.R. (2d) 247 (C.A.); <i>Mayes
    v. Ferguson</i> (1992), 102 Sask. R. 250 (Q.B.); <i>Hunter v. Manning</i>,
    [1993] S.J. No. 697 (Q.B.); and <i><span
style='color:black'>Knoblauch v. Biwer Estate</span></i><span style='color:
black'> (1992), 104 Sask. R. 31 (Q.B.).</span>  This result appears to be inconsistent
    with the approach taken in <i>Daly</i> that the loss is non-pecuniary and,
    when there has been no replacement housekeeper, that replacement cost is
    not an appropriate measure of damages.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, the cases following <i>Fobel</i> appear to have developed an unnecessarily
    complex approach to the evaluation of non-pecuniary and pecuniary housekeeping
    losses.  In
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Cairns</i><i> v. Harris</i> (1993), 105 Nfld. &amp;
    P.E.I.R. 43, the trial judge calculated the non-pecuniary damages, as well
    as the future loss award, on the basis of replacement value.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    upholding the trial judge’s award on appeal, Carruthers C.J.P.E.I. considered
    a hypothetical plaintiff who, pre-trial, had undertaken some household tasks
    with difficulty and relied on some substitute help for others: <a name="OLE_LINK2"></a><a name="OLE_LINK1">(1994),
    117 Nfld. &amp; P.E.I.R. 216 </a>(P.E.I.C.A.), at para. 42.  Carruthers C.J.P.E.I.
    expressed the view that, in this situation, a trial judge should first
    “determine the amount of compensation he would have awarded to the victim
    on the basis that she did not employ any substitute performance at all”.  Second,
    the trial judge will “determine the value of the substitute performance” and
    award that amount as special damages.  Finally, the trial judge will
    “reduce the amount [she or he] would have awarded to the victim if there
    had been no substitute performance” by the amount of the special damages.  The
    resulting damages will be classified as non-pecuniary damages. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    such an approach may reach a logical result in the end, in my view, the approach
    is unnecessarily complex, particularly in the context of a jury trial, which
    continues to be a common way of litigating personal injury claims in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    turn to consider whether this complexity is necessary in the light of the
    jury instructions on these issues given in this case.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(5)       The Charge in This Case</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s charge and re-charges to the jury in this case reflected the
    case law I have just reviewed.  As a result, in my view, the instructions
    misled the jury in two ways.  First, the instructions unnecessarily subdivided
    non-pecuniary damages into two categories.  Second, undue complexity and
    confusion was injected into the instructions by requiring the jury to deduct
    a non-pecuniary award from a pecuniary award.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Regarding
    the first issue, the charge appeared to encourage the jury to separate inefficiency
    damages from the balance of the non-pecuniary award for pain and suffering
    and loss of the amenities of life.  In my view, it is generally inappropriate
    to create a separate heading for one particular component of a global award
    for non-pecuniary damages.  Such a compartmentalization is both artificial
    and contrary to the <i>Andrews </i>instruction that non-pecuniary damages
    should be assessed globally due to the overlapping nature of the various
    components.  Moreover, it is unnecessary to divide non-pecuniary losses into
    sub-categories.  Juries across
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    have long demonstrated their ability to incorporate a variety of losses into
    a global award for non-pecuniary damages.  As is evident from the questions
    posed during its deliberations, an instruction to compartmentalize can only
    cause confusion for the jury and, in my view, is not necessary for the purpose
    of appellate review.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Regarding
    the second issue, I cannot agree that the jury should calculate the award
    for past lost housekeeping by first determining the whole of the plaintiff’s
    housekeeping losses using a substitute homemaker approach, and then deducting
    from that the amount of the non-pecuniary award for inefficiency damages.  This
    methodology appears to be based on a variation on the calculation by the
    Court of Appeal in <i>Daly</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    as I have explained, the deduction at the appellate level in that case simply
    remedied the approach of the trial judge in order to take the husband-related
    housework into account.  <i>Daly</i> does not stand for the general principle
    that pecuniary damages intended to compensate the plaintiff for the work
    performed by third parties should be deducted from the plaintiff’s non-pecuniary
    intangible losses for increased pain and suffering or, conversely, that such
    non-pecuniary losses should be deducted from the pecuniary damages intended
    to compensate the plaintiff for the work performed by third parties.  As
    explained below, while pecuniary and non-pecuniary losses are often interdependent,
    each are assessed separately without any arithmetical deduction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    regarding the charge to the jury, the appellants argue that the trial judge
    erred in putting future housekeeping costs to the jury in the absence of
    evidence that the respondent had a firm intention to employ a homemaker in
    the future.  I would not accept this argument.  I agree with the observation
    of Bridge L.J., at p. 701 of<i> Daly</i>, that it is unnecessary for the
    plaintiff to satisfy the court of a firm intention to employ third-party
    help.  Rather, it is for the plaintiff to decide whether she will employ
    a homemaker or whether she will struggle with her housekeeping and spend
    the damage award on luxuries that would otherwise be unavailable.  <span style='color:black'>Similarly,
    in my view a plaintiff is entitled to a pecuniary award for future loss whether
    the replacement labour is full-time or part-time.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(6)       Framework for Housekeeping Losses</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    order to provide guidance for future cases, I now turn to consider the nature
    of the damages that arise in each of the scenarios of housekeeping losses
    outlined above in para. 21.  I approach the scenarios mindful that pecuniary
    and non-pecuniary losses are often interdependent, so that a plaintiff’s
    pecuniary award for a particular loss may have an impact on the non-pecuniary
    award in relation to the same loss.  <b><i></i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the same time, I observe that a plaintiff may not be fully compensated by
    a pecuniary award for past housekeeping losses, even one that provides for
    the complete costs of a notional or substitute homemaker.  Despite such a
    pecuniary award, for complete compensation, the plaintiff may additionally
    require recognition in the non-pecuniary award of her or his loss of self-worth
    resulting from the inability to contribute personally to the well-being of
    the household.  <b><i></i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    also observe that, while I specifically address the non-pecuniary aspects
    of the loss under pre-trial losses for work undone, those observations apply
    to all types of housekeeping losses.</p>
  <h3><i>(i)        Pre-Trial: Work Left Undone</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where
    the injured plaintiff is unable to perform some or all housekeeping tasks,
    and where a third party does not do the work in the injured person’s stead,
    work will be left undone.  In that situation, the injured plaintiff will
    experience two sorts of intangible losses compensable in an award of non-pecuniary
    damages. <span style='color:black'>  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='color:black'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>First,
      the modern law of damages recognizes that work, whether employment outside
      the home or housekeeping inside the home, provides a human being with an
      important sense of purpose and contribution, the loss of which is a loss
      personal to the plaintiff.  This is because a plaintiff’s pre-accident
      housekeeping would have contributed to her or his sense of identity in
      the same way that an income-earning plaintiff would perceive her or his
      earnings to be a valuable contribution to the family’s financial health.  Loss
      of either type of contribution diminishes one’s sense of identity.  Second,
      where work is left undone, the plaintiff will be forced to live with the
      loss of the amenity of an orderly and functioning home.  In both cases,
      because the losses are intangible in nature, they are compensable within
      the award for non-pecuniary damages. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='color:black'>Recognizing
      this, the Saskatchewan Court of Appeal in <i>Fobel</i> held that, in the
      absence of replacement labour, the loss is properly compensated as a component
      of non-pecuniary damages. However, as explained above, while Vancise J.A.
      stated that one relevant factor is the replacement value of the undone
      housekeeping, some post-<i>Fobel</i> courts have relied heavily on replacement
      value or used it as the sole factor in assessing such damages. </span> </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By
    taking this approach, the cases are effectively using a pecuniary measure
    to determine a non-pecuniary loss, which blurs the distinction between the
    two types of losses.  In those cases, the approach likely developed because
    it was perceived to achieve a measure of fair compensation for past housekeeping
    losses.  It was also a convenient measure, since courts were often already
    looking at replacement cost to measure pecuniary losses involving future
    substitute housekeeping.  Nonetheless, the use of an arithmetical yardstick
    does not conform to the traditional distinction between the calculable nature
    of a pecuniary loss and the intangible nature of a non-pecuniary loss. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    the use of replacement value is not appropriate in assessing a non-pecuniary
    award, the corollary question arises whether an injured plaintiff ought to
    be entitled to a separate pecuniary award for the value of work undone, either
    instead of or in addition to the award for non-pecuniary damages.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    current approach denying a separate pecuniary award for housekeeping may
    mean that unpaid work is unjustifiably treated differently than paid work.  In
    the case of paid work, the plaintiff will make a claim for the pre-trial
    income she or he would have earned but for the accident.<a href="#_ftn8"
name="_ftnref8" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[8]</span></span></span></a>  Such a claim is one for a pecuniary loss, or
    special damages, since it is calculable with a reasonable degree of certainty
    based on the available evidence.  As I have observed, in contrast, unpaid
    housekeeping left undone is often recognized only as a non-pecuniary loss
    on the basis that the only loss is the intangible one arising from the loss
    of the amenity of an orderly household and a loss of a sense of contribution. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    an argument can be made to support a pecuniary award on the basis that it
    is consistent and fair to compensate the loss of
    “unpaid” work on the same basis as “paid” employment and that it is unfair
    to relegate “unpaid” undone housekeeping, in this case past lost housekeeping,
    to the homogeneous basket of non-pecuniary damages.<a
href="#_ftn9" name="_ftnref9" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[9]</span></span></span></a>  Non-pecuniary damages are restricted both by
    the cap imposed on them by the Supreme Court of Canada<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[10]</span></span></span></a> and by the <i>Andrews</i> admonition that such
    awards must be modest.  <b><i></i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    can also be argued that a pecuniary award would achieve a measure of recognition
    for the economic value of unpaid housekeeping.  The denial of such an award
    may be seen to unfairly diminish the contribution of those responsible for
    the bulk of housekeeping, still largely women, and to perpetuate inequalities
    that society has worked hard to overcome.<a href="#_ftn11" name="_ftnref11" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[11]</span></span></span></a> <b><i></i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the other hand, treating undone housekeeping on the same basis as lost wages
    arguably does not conform to the traditional view or current Canadian case
    law regarding the nature of a “pecuniary” loss during the pre-trial period:  see <i>MacLean
    v. MacDonald</i> (2002), 201 N.S.R. (2d) 237 (C.A.), and <i>British Transport
    Commission v. Gourley</i>, [1956] A.C. 185 (H.L.).  This is because lost
    wages are clearly a pecuniary loss that is ascertainable at the time of trial.  However,
    an unpaid homemaker does not suffer a loss of wages, but rather the loss
    of the benefit of having done the housekeeping, including the personal intangibles
    such as the sense of purpose and contribution referred to earlier, as well
    as the loss of the amenity of an organized household.  <b><i></i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Some
    may also argue on a related point that awarding pecuniary damages for undone
    pre-trial housekeeping would raise questions about the possible extension
    of compensation for other types of unpaid work on the basis of an imputed
    salary.  As well, it may require the trier of fact to conceptualize a situation
    that did not occur.  If a loss of income is imputed to a plaintiff for unpaid
    housekeeping, the assessment of the non-pecuniary damages would then be based
    on the hypothetical assumption that the homemaker had completed the housekeeping
    or had hired someone to do so, rather than on the homemaker’s evidence of
    her actual pre-trial pain and suffering.  As well, issues of mitigation may
    arise.  <b><i></i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    these important issues, relating to how to put the plaintiff back in the
    same position she or he would have been in but for the accident, must be
    left for another day.  In this case, the respondent’s claim was not based
    on housekeeping undone but on housekeeping the respondent testified that
    she performed inefficiently or was done by her family members.  In the absence
    of a claim by the plaintiff for work undone, it is unnecessary to come to
    a conclusion regarding the factors that ought to be considered in assessing
    non-pecuniary damages and whether undone work can give rise to a separate
    claim for pecuniary damages.  These issues may arise on the facts of a future
    case where the court will have the benefit of a full factual foundation and
    complete legal argument.</p>
  <h3><i>(ii)       Pre-Trial: Work Done by the Plaintiff with Difficulty </i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>Turning
      to the second scenario, a plaintiff may continue to undertake housekeeping,
      but may experience pain or difficulty in doing so, as did the plaintiff
      in this case.  She or he may be required to work more hours post-accident
      to accomplish the same amount of pre-accident housekeeping.  If a plaintiff
      thus works
    “inefficiently”, her or his </span>non-pecuniary award would be increased
    to reflect any increased pain and suffering.  To the extent the plaintiff’s
    inefficiency also results in a less clean and organized household, this is
    the loss of an amenity that the award for non-pecuniary damages would also
    take into account. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>These
      aspects of the non-pecuniary award will be assessed in a manner similar
      to the assessment of non-pecuniary losses for a plaintiff who faces increased
      pain and suffering in performing income-earning tasks.  In determining
      the significance of the components of the loss, the court will consider
      the evidence about the plaintiff’s pre-accident and pre-trial housekeeping,
      the particulars of any increased pain and suffering and diminishment in
      housekeeping, and the impact of any reduction in the standard of housekeeping
      on the plaintiff.  </span></p>
  <h3><i>(iii)     Pre-Trial: Work Done by Third Parties</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    law is well established that where a plaintiff incurs a pre-trial out-of-pocket
    loss by hiring a replacement homemaker, the plaintiff may claim the reasonable
    replacement cost of that homemaker as special damages.<a href="#_ftn12" name="_ftnref12"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

    agreed or was otherwise obliged to compensate a third party for services
    rendered pre-trial, the plaintiff may claim that amount as special damages. </p>

style='line-height:200%;'>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this case, the respondent seeks compensation for the gratuitous work done
    by her family members.  However, the respondent failed to plead or lead sufficient
    evidence to support such a claim.  Neither the family members nor the respondent
    provided any particulars of the time the family members spent assisting the
    respondent as a result of her injuries during the pre-trial period, which
    was seven years.  Rather,  respondent’s counsel presented the case in terms
    of percentage impairments, which blurred the evidence relating to past housekeeping
    inefficiency and the work she was unable to do that was being done by others.<a href="#_ftn13" name="_ftnref13"

'>The respondent also presented economic evidence as to the average number of
      hours of productive household activities someone in the respondent’s situation
      would perform.  The difficulty is that, even assuming the jury accepted
      that the statistics were appropriate for the respondent’s situation, the
      statistical evidence was not linked to the respondent’s evidence regarding
      her degree of incapacity in a way that would have allowed the jury to quantify
      the hours of work performed on her behalf by family members.  While Dr.
      Charette gave evidence that the average would be 3.5 hours per day that
      number included all productive household activities, including all housework,
      home maintenance, gardening and child care.  Although the respondent gave
      evidence as to the percentage of housework and the percentage of gardening
      she could do, her percentages related to sub-components of the 3.5 hour

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    addition to amounts related to loss of earnings, the jury in this case awarded
    the plaintiff $5,000 for past housekeeping inefficiency damages, $10,400
    for past lost housekeeping, and $44,535 for future lost housekeeping for
    at total of $59,935 in housekeeping losses.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    focus of the appeal did not challenge the amounts of the individual housekeeping
    awards but rather the underlying legal principles.  These principles included
    whether inefficiency damages should be a sub-heading of non-pecuniary damages,
    whether the respondent was entitled to an award for work performed by her
    family members and whether damages could be awarded for a future loss in
    the absence of evidence that the respondent firmly intended to hire a housekeeper.  I
    have already dealt with each of these arguments.</p>

lang=EN-US>[82]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    doing so, I have indicated that issue can be taken fairly with the categorization
    of certain aspects of the individual housekeeping awards in this case.  However,
    when viewed globally, and bearing in mind the lack of differentiation between
    inefficiency and third-party damages at trial, the total pecuniary and non-pecuniary
    housekeeping award of $59,935 was supported by the evidence.  That evidence
    included <span
style='color:black'>the extent of the respondent’s pain and suffering in performing
    housekeeping tasks, evidence relating to her high housekeeping standards
    and the impact of her injuries on those standards, evidence regarding her
    loss of ability to do tasks she previously enjoyed, such as gardening, and
    evidence about the impact of her pain on her relationships with others, all
    of which contributed to her lack of well being.</span></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
style='line-height:200%;color:black'>[85]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants’ next ground<b> </b>of appeal rests on their argument that the
    trial judge failed to adequately put their position to the jury.  In particular,
    the appellants argue that the trial judge failed to put the position to the
    jury that the respondent’s presentation was aggravated by factors unrelated
    to the accident, including this litigation, the respondent’s litigation against
    her insurer, the stress of raising two children and moving into a larger
    home, and the respondent’s failure to embark on a course of opioid medication.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[86]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    the appellants’ objection at trial, the trial judge gave two reasons for
    refusing to re-charge the jury.  First, trial counsel had not asked the plaintiff
    about the impact of these factors during her testimony.  Second, the jury
    had heard expert evidence about the impact of the factors on the respondent,
    and the opinion of the appellants’ expert about the respondent’s ability
    to return to full-time work in short order.  In addition, the jury would
    have been alive to the expert evidence about opioid medication.  The trial
    judge referenced the expert opinion in his charge and also instructed the
    jury about trial counsel’s “compromise position” that the respondent could
    take as long as two to three years to return to full-time employment.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[87]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, reading the charge as a whole in the context of the trial, it was
    evident to the jury that the appellants’ and the respondent’s experts took
    different positions regarding the cause, the extent, and the duration of
    the respondent’s injuries.  In the circumstances of this case, the trial
    judge was not obliged to embark on a detailed examination of the underlying
    foundation for each expert opinion.  I would not give effect to this ground
    of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    conclude on this issue by noting that, in the appellants’ factum, counsel
    argues that the trial judge appeared to support the respondent’s position
    in both the “tone and manner of presentation” to the jury.  This ground was
    not pursued in oral argument and I am unable to identify any foundation for
    this submission.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>C.        Unreasonable Jury Verdict</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[89]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the appellants argue, apart from the issue of the amount of the housekeeping
    damages, that the jury’s verdict was unreasonable in view of the evidence
    regarding the respondent’s potential rehabilitation, the beneficial effects
    of opioid medication, and the use of general statistics by the respondent’s
    expert economist. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[90]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, there was ample evidence regarding the respondent’s prognosis
    and treatment, all of which would have been weighed by the jury during deliberations,
    to support the verdict.  In addition, while the expert’s evidence could not
    provide the necessary particulars regarding the time spent by the family
    members, it remained open to the jury to conclude on the basis of that and
    other evidence that the respondent was unable to fulfill a portion of her
    housekeeping responsibilities.  Accordingly, I would not give effect to this
    ground of appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>VI.       RESULT</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[91]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[92]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I

      Damages in Canada</i>, 2d ed. (Toronto: Thomson Canada, 1996) expresses
      the opinion, at p. 522, that lost homemaking, whether past or future, is
      fundamentally pecuniary:  “Lost capacity for homemaking seems fundamentally
      pecuniary, pre-trial as well as post-trial.  The plaintiff was unable to
      carry out tasks the way she did before, and this has an economic value.”  </p>

    for one-time housekeeping projects to maintain the home pending trial, as
    well as any reasonable expenditures for other pecuniary losses, such as the
    cost of order-in or restaurant meals, cleaning services, home repair, house
    maintenance and yard services.  <span style='color:black'>As well, while

'>[13]</span></span></span></a> In discussions between the trial judge and counsel
    regarding the jury’s question about the difference between the two types
    of past homemaking damages, the trial judge refers to the respondent’s statement
    that she could do two-thirds of the housework but not as well.  The trial
    judge says “the one-third is what she gets compensated for” in pecuniary
    damages.  Mr. Rachlin explains that “the evidence I recall her giving, what
    I adduced from her was I was asking her what is the extent she thought her
    capacity to do work had changed.  I understood the answer to encompass both
    [past housekeeping inefficiency damages and past lost housekeeping capacity.]”  There
    was also a blurring between inefficiency and lost housekeeping in the expert
    evidence.  For instance, Dr. Jasey suggested the respondent experienced a
    50% loss of capacity in homemaking on the basis that her endurance was reduced:
    she used to be able to work a full eight hours per day prior to the accident,
    and now she could only work up to four hours.  Likewise, Dr. Merskey estimated
    that she would have a “100% loss on the heavy cleaning” and approximately
    a 50% loss in terms of other housework, since what would have taken her one
    day would have to be spread over many more days.  Dr. Clyne also gave a “ball
    park figure” of more than 50% impairment, which Mr. Rachlin clarified took
    into account what the respondent could not do as well as efficiency issues.</p>
