  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Introduction</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    appellants are teachers who are alleged to have failed to report “forthwith” a
    suspicion of harm to a child, contrary to ss. 72(1), (4) and (5) of the <i>Child
    and Family Services Act, </i>R.S.O. 1990, c. C.11 (the “CFSA”). They were
    charged with this offence more than six months following the occurrence of
    the harm. The charges were quashed as statute-barred pursuant to the six-month
    limitation period set out in s. 76(1) of the <i>Provincial Offences Act, </i>R.S.O.
    1990, c. P.33 (the “POA”).<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a> The sole issue on appeal is whether s. 72(1) creates
    one offence, or a continuing offence. If it creates one offence, the charges
    were laid out of time; if the offence is a continuing offence, then there
    is effectively no time limit on when charges may be laid until a report is
    made.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Facts</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents were the principal and vice-principals of C.W. Jeffries Collegiate
    Institute. In October 2006, a female student at the school was sexually assaulted.
    Information regarding the assault came to the attention of the police on
    June 28, 2007, through the Falconer Inquiry into the shooting death of Jordan
    Manners, another student at the school. The respondents’ alleged failure
    to report their suspicions that the female student was in need of protection
    also came to the attention of the police at that time. The respondents were
    charged with failing to report suspicions that a child was in need of protection,
    contrary to s. 72 of the CFSA, on December 27, 2007.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents brought a motion to quash the informations on the basis that
    they were laid outside the six-month limitation period in s. 76(1) of the
    POA<i>.</i> Justice of the Peace John granted the order. He found that the
    offence was not a continuing offence, but was complete once no report was
    made forthwith and, therefore, the charges were out of time. The Crown applied
    before Croll J. for an order in the nature of <i>certiorari</i> and <i>mandamus</i> that
    the charges were not statute-barred and should be allowed to proceed on the
    basis that the offence is a continuing offence until the report is made.
    Croll J. dismissed the application, agreeing with the Justice of the Peace
    that the offence is not a continuing offence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown appeals the decision of Croll J., and asks this court to find that
    the offence of failing to report forthwith a suspicion that a child is in
    need of protection is a continuing offence and, therefore, because the respondents
    never reported their suspicions, the charges were not out of time.<i></i></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(a)       Statutory Context</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    relevant subsections of s. 72 provide:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>72. (1) Despite the provisions of any other Act,
    if a person, including a person who performs professional or official duties
    with respect to children, has reasonable grounds to suspect one of the following
    [from a list of physical and emotional harms or potential harms to a child
    either done or not prevented by a person with charge of the child – see the
    Appendix for the complete list including pending amendments not yet proclaimed
    into force], the person shall <i>forthwith</i> report the suspicion and the
    information on which it is based to a society:… [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2) A person who has additional reasonable grounds
    to suspect one of the matters set out in subsection (1) shall make a further
    report under subsection (1) even if he or she has made previous reports with
    respect to the same child.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(4) A person referred to in subsection (5) is guilty
    of an offence if,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) he or she contravenes subsection (1) or (2)
    by not reporting a suspicion; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b) the information on which it was based was obtained
    in the course of his or her professional or official duties.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><a name="P2137_182872"></a><a name=s72s5></a>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;Subsection
    (4) applies to every person who performs professional or official duties
    with respect to children including,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b) a teacher, school principal, social worker,
    family counsellor, operator or employee of a day nursery and youth and recreation
    worker…</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the CFSA contains no limitation period for this offence, s. 76(1) of the
    POA applies. That section provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>76.(1) A proceeding shall not be commenced after
    the expiration of any limitation period prescribed by or under any Act for
    the offence or, where no limitation period is prescribed, after six months
    after the date on which the offence was, or is alleged to have been, committed.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(b)       Single versus Continuing Offence</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    issue in this case is whether s. 72(1) of the CFSA creates a single or a
    continuing offence. The proper approach to interpreting the meaning of a
    legislative provision is well-established. The Supreme Court has made it
    clear in a series of cases including <i>Re Rizzo &amp; Rizzo Shoes Ltd., </i>[1998]
    1 S.C.R. 27, at para. 21, <i>Bell Expressvu Ltd. Partnership v. Rex, </i>[2002]
    2 S.C.R. 559, at para. 26, and <i>Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    (Attorney General), </i>[2005] 1 S.C.R. 533, at para. 37<b>, </b>that the
    proper approach to statutory interpretation is to read the words of an Act “in
    their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously
    with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act and the intent of Parliament”:
    see Elmer Driedger, <i>The Construction of Statutes</i>, 2nd ed. (Toronto:
    Butterworths, 1983), at p. 87; Ruth Sullivan, <i>Sullivan on the Construction
    of Statutes, </i>5<sup>th</sup> ed., (Markham:
    <st1:PersonName
w:st="on">
    LexisNexis, 2008), at p. 1. This is consistent with s. 64 (1) of the <i>Legislation
    Act</i>, 2006, S.O., c. 21, Schedule F, which provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>64.(1) An Act shall be interpreted as being remedial
    and shall be given such fair, large and liberal interpretation as best ensures
    the attainment of its objects.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    purposes of the CFSA are set out in s. 1 of the Act. The paramount purpose
    as stated in s. 1(1), “is to promote the best interests, protection and well
    being of children.” Additional purposes, consistent with the paramount purpose,
    are set out in s. 1(2). These purposes provide a principled framework and
    context within which to implement the provisions of the CFSA and to interpret
    whether the failure to report is a single or continuing offence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Consistent
    with the proper approach to statutory interpretation, this court must decide
    whether interpreting the nature of the offence in s. 72(1) as a single or
    a continuing offence will best further the purposes of the CFSA outlined
    above. With particular regard to the primary purpose, the question to be
    answered is which interpretation will best protect children who may be at
    risk of harm by making it more likely teachers and other individuals who
    are subject to the statutory duty in s. 72(1), will report forthwith. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    court had occasion to consider a similar issue in <i>Ontario (Workplace Safety
    and Insurance Board) v. Hamilton Health Sciences Corp. </i>(2000), 51 O.R.
    (3d) 83. In that case, the issue was whether a statutory offence of failure
    to report an accident under the <i>Workplace Safety and Insurance Act, 1997, </i>S.O.
    1997, c.16, Schedule A (the “WSIA”), constituted a single or a continuing
    offence. The section at issue was s. 21(1) of the WSIA which stated: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>An employer shall notify the [Workplace Safety
    and Insurance] Board <i>within three days after learning of an accident</i> to
    a worker employed by him, her or it if the accident necessitates health care
    or results in the worker not being able to earn full wages. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    issue, again for limitation purposes, was whether the words “within three
    days after learning of an accident” meant that the offence was complete if
    the report was not made to the Workplace Safety and Insurance Board (the “Board”)
    within the three days, or whether it continued until a report was made. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown took the position that the essential element of the offence was the
    failure to report. <i>Amicus curiae </i>counsel, who argued the position
    of the employer, submitted that the essential element of the offence was
    the timeliness of a report. These are effectively the positions of the parties
    in this case as well.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Hamilton
      Health Sciences</i>, the object of the WSIA was to promote workplace health
      and safety in a financially responsible and accountable manner including
      the return to work of injured workers and compensation for them. The Board
      could only provide compensation, rehabilitation and vocational training
      if and when it learned of an injury. Rosenberg J.A. concluded that the
      interpretation of the duty to report an accident within three days that
      would best achieve the object of the WSIA was to emphasize the duty to
      report over the timeliness of that report.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Rosenberg
    J.A. interpreted the phrase “within three days after learning of an accident” as
    providing the employer with a three-day grace period before the employer
    had the obligation to report. However, once the obligation took effect, it
    remained in effect until the employer complied with its duty. Otherwise,
    there would be a built-in incentive for the employer not to report until
    the six-month limitation period for a charge to be laid had passed, in the
    hope that the Board would not learn of the injury within that time. There
    were also financial consequences to the employer, unrelated to any charge
    that might be laid, for every workplace injury.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Hamilton
      Health Sciences, </i>as the injury to the employee had already occurred,
      the timing of the report was not critical to ensuring that the purpose
      of the WSIA was carried out. The grace period could have been longer without
      impeding that purpose. What was critical was that a report be made so that
      the Board would know about the injury and take the necessary steps to implement
      compensation and rehabilitation programs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the Crown acknowledges that reporting “forthwith”
    a suspicion of possible harm to a child is critical to the effective operation
    of the CFSA. The legislature has recognized that there is urgency in such
    a situation; it provided no grace period as part of the obligation to report.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown submits, however, that it is necessary to interpret s. 72(1) as creating
    a continuing offence in order to ensure that a report will be made eventually,
    even if it is made late. It argues that to interpret the section as creating
    one offence, failure to report “forthwith”, will mean that once a person
    with an obligation to report a suspicion of a risk of harm to a child has
    failed to report as soon as the person had the information and the suspicion,
    the person will have committed the offence, and will have an incentive to
    remain silent until the limitation period has passed. It argues that if the
    section creates a continuing offence, then the person, such as a teacher,
    with an obligation to report, will be in jeopardy until a report is made,
    and that that ongoing jeopardy will be an incentive to report eventually. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    in making this argument, the Crown acknowledges that under its interpretation,
    the person has committed the offence by the original failure to report forthwith
    and continues to commit the offence until a report is made. Therefore, whenever
    a person makes a late report, the person is effectively admitting the offence
    of failing to report a suspicion forthwith.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Given
    that reality, in my view it is unclear how construing the section as creating
    a continuing offence would encourage reporting. To the contrary, applying
    the Crown’s reasoning, a person who has already committed the offence by
    failing to report forthwith could decide to remain silent forever and hope
    that no one ever finds out, rather than report and be inevitably subject
    to a charge. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge dealt with this submission, in my view, very effectively.
    First, she pointed out that the scheme of the CFSA already contemplates an
    ongoing duty to report in s. 72(2); where new information comes to the attention
    of the person with the duty, that person must report the new information.
    Second, because there is a duty on every teacher as well as other named professionals
    to report, there is always the possibility, if not the likelihood, that someone
    else may learn of information that raises the same suspicion and will report,
    so that every person with a suspicion will know that they cannot rely on
    the information remaining secret. Most importantly, the application judge
    emphasized the integrity and commitment of childcare professionals, stating,
    at para. 24:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[I]n my view, in the case of child care professionals,
    the suggestion that they would not report when they suspected that a child
    was in need of protection out of some sort of self-interest does not ring
    true and does a disservice to the profession. In contrast to an employer
    under the [WSIA, the statute at issue in <i>Hamilton Health Sciences</i>]
    a child care professional is simply a third party observer of the child,
    who has no direct stake in the outcome of reporting (except for the benefits
    that accrue to all members of society when children are properly cared for.)
    With no direct self-interest to counter, the [CFSA] does not require the
    same safeguards that were found to be necessary in the [WSIA]<i>,</i> to
    ensure reporting.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    seems to me that the real problem for the Crown with this type of offence
    is that it is very difficult for the police to obtain information that the
    offence of failing to report forthwith has been committed. The limitation
    period under s. 76(1) of the POA begins to run when the offence is committed,
    not when the police learn of it. By the time the police have information
    that the offence may have been committed, the limitation period may well
    have expired.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    problem arises from the nature of the offence itself and the operation of
    the limitation period. The primary purpose of the statutory duty to report,
    and of the offence of failing to report, is to encourage the reporting of
    information that a child may be in danger of harm from the person with charge
    of that child, which information may only become known by a teacher or a
    healthcare professional in the course of that person’s professional relationship
    with the child. It is because the information is in many cases
    “secret”, that the statutory duty to report a suspicion forthwith was viewed
    as necessary for the protection of the child. However, that same secrecy
    means that unless someone else has the same suspicion, reports as required
    and also knows that another person knew and did not report, or the child
    goes to the authorities, it may be very difficult, and sometimes impossible,
    for the police to learn that the offence of failure to report forthwith has
    occurred. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    this is a problem caused not by the nature of the offence as single or continuing,
    but by the operation of the limitation period which runs from the date of
    the offence, rather than from the date when the authorities learn of the
    offence. The legislature recognized this problem following the <i>Hamilton
    Health Sciences</i> decision. As the application judge noted, the legislature
    amended the WSIA<i> </i>by enacting a two-year limitation period that runs
    not from the date of the offence (the failure to report), but from the date
    when the most recent act or omission came to the attention of the Board:

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    complete the analysis, it is necessary to consider other indicia of the legislature’s
    intent to create either a single or a continuing offence. A continuing offence
    was described by the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>R. v. Bell</i>, [1983]
    2 S.C.R. 471, at p.&nbsp;488, as follows:<i></i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A continuing offence is not simply an offence which
    takes or may take a long time to commit. It may be described as an offence
    where the conjunction of the <i>actus
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    reus</i> and the <i>mens rea, </i>which makes the offence complete, does
    not, as well, terminate the offence. The conjunction of the two essential
    elements for the commission of the offence continues and the accused remains
    in what might be described as a state of criminality while the offence continues.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown also relies on the description of a continuing offence given by the
    Supreme Court of Victoria in <i>R. v. Industrial Appeals Court, Ex parte
    Barelli’s Bakeries Pty Ltd.</i>, [1965] V.R. 615, that was approved by this
    court in <i>Hamilton Health Sciences,</i> at para. 15:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A continuous or continuing offence is a concept
    well known in the criminal law and is often used to describe two different
    kinds of crime. There is the crime which is constituted by conduct which
    goes on from day to day and which constitutes a separate and distinct offence
    each day the conduct continues. There is, on the other hand, the kind of
    conduct, generally of a passive character, which consists in the failure
    to perform a duty imposed by law. Such passive conduct may constitute a crime
    when first indulged in but if the obligation is continuous the breach though
    constituting one crime only continues day by day to be a crime until the
    obligation is performed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown submits that failing to report forthwith a suspicion that a child is
    in need of protection is “the kind of conduct, generally of a passive character,
    which consists in the failure to perform a duty imposed by law.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree that breaching a duty by failing to report information forthwith could
    be legislatively drafted as an initial offence that continues until the report
    is made. However, there is no indication in the wording of s. 72(1) that
    the offence is intended to be interpreted as a continuing offence until a
    report is made. As already discussed, there is the requirement that the report
    be made “forthwith”. There is no language that states that the duty to report
    forthwith continues until the report is made. Nor does the CFSA provide a
    penalty that is incremental until a report is made. In contrast, for example,
    where an offence is committed under s. 206 of the CFSA in respect of the
    provision of residences and residential care, an offender is liable to pay
    a fine for each day that the offence continues. <i></i></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Conclusion</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Applying
    the same test as was applied by this court in <i>Hamilton Health Sciences</i>,
    to the extent there may be any ambiguity in the wording of the offence in
    s. 72(1) of the CFSA, to best achieve the purpose of protection of children,
    should the court place emphasis on the duty to make a report, or on the timeliness
    of that report being made “forthwith”? In my view, the interpretation that
    best ensures that childcare workers understand that their obligation is to
    report any suspicion
    “forthwith” is the interpretation that emphasizes the timeliness of the report.
    I conclude, therefore, that the offence is a single offence, rather than
    a continuing offence.<i></i></p>

    the child is in a residential placement and the parent refuses or is unable
    or unwilling to resume the child's care and custody.</p>
  <p class=paragraph-e>12. The child is less than 12 years old and has killed
    or seriously injured another person or caused serious damage to another person's
