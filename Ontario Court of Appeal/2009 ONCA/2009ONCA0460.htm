  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    August 22, 2006, Ramanan Mylvaganam (the applicant) was arrested on a provisional
    arrest warrant issued under the <i>Extradition Act</i>. He was released from
    custody on October 2, 2006.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    October 7, 2008, over two years after his release from custody, the applicant
    was ordered committed for surrender by a judge of the Superior Court of Justice.
    The extradition partner, the
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      United States of America</st1:country-region>
    , seeks the applicant’s return for prosecution on criminal charges of providing
    material support for a terrorist organization, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil
    Eelam.  The corresponding Canadian offences are those of ss. 83.03 and 83.18
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    applicant was released from custody on October 17, 2008 pending the determination
    of his appeal from the committal order.  The Minister has since signed an
    order for the applicant’s surrender.  The applicant has not sought to review
    the Minister’s surrender decision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    applicant’s appeal from the order of committal was heard on May 14, 2009.  Judgment
    was reserved.  The applicant now seeks his release on stringent terms pending
    release of the court’s judgment.  The extradition partner opposes.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the applicant, Mr. Litkowski begins with a reminder that the applicant has
    been out of custody between apprehension and committal, and from committal
    until his appeal was heard, for nearly two and one-half years. The terms
    of his release have been strict. No breaches are suggested, much less established.
    He has diligently pursued advanced studies at a well-known and highly respected
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario university.  Soon, he will accumulate this third Master’s Degree.  He
    plans to pursue a Ph.D.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Litkowski contends that the prospect that the applicant will now attempt
    or actually flee to
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Sri Lanka</st1:country-region>
    , the country of his birth, is simply beyond imagination.  He has not returned
    there since his arrival in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    seventeen years ago and, in the current state of unrest in that country,
    it would be at the least foolhardy to even contemplate it.  All the more
    so, when family or friends have pledged substantial amounts as sureties to
    guarantee his compliance with the stringent terms of his proposed release.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What
    is more, Mr. Litkowski says, the <i>Record of the Case</i> does not suggest
    that the applicant is himself an active member of the Tamil Tigers, a listed
    terrorist organization.  His involvement in their activities, Mr. Litkowski
    submits, was of brief duration and the assistance actually provided, minimal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the extradition partner, Mr. Kramer acknowledges that he can point to no
    specific evidence that the applicant is a flight risk.  At least nothing
    that surpasses the assumed: the incentive to flee increases in direct proportion
    to the proximity of the date of removal. That said, Mr. Kramer does raise
    some concerns about two replacement sureties, in particular, their ability
    to offer real property security without the concurrence of their spouses.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    principal concern expressed by Mr. Kramer has to do with the public interest.  The
    applicant faces trial on criminal charges involving terrorist activities.
    The organization involved is international in its operations, as the <i>Record
    of the Case</i> amply demonstrates.  And besides, the applicant faces a formidable
    prosecution case in the jurisdiction of the extradition partner, the
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      United States of America</st1:country-region>
    .</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Kramer underscores that these proceedings engage
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    ’s international obligations and involve allegations of terrorist activity.
    The authorities emphasize that extradition proceedings are to be conducted
    efficiently and expeditiously.  They involve not only the administration
    of justice here but also the administration of justice in the jurisdiction
    of our extradition partners.  We have an obligation, Mr. Kramer submits,
    to ensure that nothing we do compromises the ability of our international
    partners to pursue their prosecutorial goals.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    applicant was released from custody prior to the extradition hearing.  Nothing
    untoward occurred. The applicant was released pending the hearing of his
    appeal.  Again, without apparent incident.  He surrendered as he was required
    to do.  He has been at liberty without incident for the better part of two
    and one-half years.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    applicant was committed to await surrender on October 7, 2008.  Since then,
    the Minister of Justice has ordered his surrender. For the better part of
    seven months, the applicant has been at liberty in the knowledge that a judge
    and the Minister have, in combination, ordered his surrender to face charges
    in the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">United States of America</st1:country-region>
    .</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus
    far, the applicant has not demonstrated any tendency to flee, rather remained
    compliant with his release terms and has continued to pursue his post-graduate
    studies.  In effect, the only change in his circumstances has been that his
    appeal from the committal order has been heard by a panel of this court and
    judgment reserved.  The respondent offers no concrete indication of an enhanced
    risk of flight beyond the proximity of a probable affirmation of the committal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    some instances, it may well be that a dormant risk of flight may be awakened
    as the appellate process trudges on towards the inevitable final resolution.
    But such a prospect seems an unlikely consequence here, all things considered,
    including but not limited to: </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>i.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    significant period during which the applicant has been at liberty in similar
    circumstances; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>ii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    applicant’s continued enrolment in and active pursuit of post-graduate university
    studies; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>iii.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    demonstrated ability of his several sureties to manage the applicant’s compliance
    with his release terms; and </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>iv.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    magnitude of the risk to the applicant’s sureties in the event of default.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    public interest assessment reflects the tension between enforceability and
    reviewability in the usual context in which it arises under s. 679(3)(c)
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  Balancing these considerations is neither scientific
    nor precise.  In cases like this, an extradition case in which the merits
    of the claims of error have already been reviewed, there is an added feature
    to the enforceability consideration: the need to fulfill and be seen to fulfill
    our obligations to our extradition partners in an efficient and expeditious
    way. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The “public
    interest” assessment was equally a factor for the judge at first instance,
    as well for the judge of this court who ordered the applicant’s release pending
    the hearing of his appeal.  Neither considered the “public interest”
    sufficient to warrant detention.  I am not persuaded that, in combination,
    the passage of time and argument of the appeal warrant any different conclusion
    where release is sought pending judgment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, I am satisfied that the applicant should be released pending
    judgment on terms substantially similar to those in the order of MacPherson
    J.A. made on October 17, 2008, varied to permit a substitution of sureties,
    provided those to be substituted have the necessary authority to offer their
    properties as security, and including a term requiring surrender prior to
    the release of judgment.</p>
