  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    appellant appeals from his conviction and sentence by Pomerance J. on arson
    and related charges.  The trial judge imposed a sentence of 12 months imprisonment
    and three years probation.  The sole ground of appeal from conviction relates
    to the trial judge’s refusal to make an order appointing counsel and staying
    proceedings until the Attorney General agreed to fund counsel for the appellant
    (a <i>Rowbotham</i> order).  For the following reasons I would allow the
    appeal from conviction and order a new trial.  In the result, it is unnecessary
    to consider the sentence appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The facts of the offence</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      Sometime
    after 3:00 p.m. on September 11, 2004, neighbours noticed that the appellant’s
    home in the Town of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Lakeshore was on fire.  The house was eventually completely involved in flames.  Members
    of the volunteer fire department put their lives in danger in attempting
    to fight the blaze.  The house and its contents were a total loss. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    doors to the house were locked and it was uncontested that the appellant
    had been at the house earlier in the day.  The appellant told police and
    others that when he had been in the house a few hours before the fire, he
    had smelled something burning.  However, he could see no smoke and no sign
    of fire.  He also told the police that he had a problem with a fuse box,
    which kept “tripping out”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      There
    was evidence that the appellant was in dire financial straits and yet he
    had recently taken steps to ensure that his lapsed account at a furniture
    store was returned to good standing, after learning that any insurance claim
    made to cover the loss of the furniture would not be honoured if the account
    was in arrears.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    Crown also adduced expert evidence in an attempt to show that the fire was
    intentionally set.  The effect of that evidence was largely negative, i.e.
    the experts could not identify any non-arson cause of the fire.  The experts
    specifically discounted a defect in the electrical wiring or the fuse boxes
    as the cause of the fire.  It was the opinion of the Fire Marshall that the
    cause of the fire was open flame to combustible material and that it had
    been intentionally set.  He considered but ruled out a smouldering fire (given
    the appellant’s statements that he had smelled smoke earlier in the day).  There
    was no evidence of any accelerant or combustible material but this could
    be the result of the intensity of the fire.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    Crown attempted to call similar fact evidence relating to three prior fires
    involving vehicles owned by the appellant.  The trial judge ruled that the
    evidence could be admitted. I will refer to that evidence below.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    appellant adduced no expert or other evidence and did not testify. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The <i>Rowbotham</i> application</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      At
    some point after the charges were laid the appellant did have counsel.  However,
    by the time of the preliminary inquiry he was unrepresented and he conducted
    the preliminary inquiry himself.  When he appeared at the opening of the
    trial, the appellant at first indicated that he was prepared to proceed without
    counsel.  The trial judge was concerned about whether this was a voluntary
    decision and it soon emerged that while the appellant wished to have counsel,
    he had been denied legal aid.  Crown counsel said she had been concerned
    about the appellant not being represented in view of the large amount of
    disclosure, “let alone the content”. Crown counsel gave a brief opening in
    which she outlined the nature of the evidence to be called: that there would
    be 30 witnesses including expert evidence, five statements made by the appellant
    to persons in authority, and similar fact evidence to show “motive and the <i>modus
    operandi</i>”. There was some brief discussion of procedural issues during
    which the appellant complained about the late delivery of materials relating
    to the Crown’s application to admit similar fact evidence. The trial judge
    then briefly adjourned the trial to consider the fact that the appellant
    was unrepresented. Upon resuming, the trial judge offered to adjourn the
    matter further so that the appellant could again speak to Legal Aid
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario through duty counsel.  As she said, she wanted “to be absolutely
    sure [that nothing fell between the cracks] before we commence a complex
    trial without counsel representing you”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      Later
    that morning a Legal Aid Ontario duty counsel attended at the trial.  She
    explained that the appellant had applied for legal aid, been refused and
    had unsuccessfully appealed the refusal in 2005.  Duty counsel stated that
    the appellant’s financial situation was “pretty much the same”, and he had
    been denied legal aid for financial reasons.  The trial judge interpreted
    duty counsel’s submission as being that “all avenues have been exhausted
    with respect to a Legal Aid certificate”. She then explained to the appellant
    the possibility of the court making a <i>Rowbotham </i>order that could result
    in the appellant having a lawyer paid for by the state.  At the appellant’s
    request, the trial judge embarked on an explanation of a <i>Rowbotham</i> application.  The
    trial judge explained the procedure to be followed on the application, including
    the kind of financial disclosure he must be ready to make.  The trial judge
    adjourned the trial for two days to permit the appellant time to assemble
    documents concerning his financial situation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge decided to hear the <i>Rowbotham </i>application in two stages.  She
    would first hear submissions on whether counsel was necessary to ensure a
    fair trial.  If that issue was resolved in the appellant’s favour, she would
    receive the evidence concerning the appellant’s financial circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the first stage, the appellant very briefly explained why he needed a lawyer.  He
    simply referred to the complexity and number of charges and stated that it
    was
    “well over my head”.  In response, Crown counsel, not Ms. Woollcombe, stated
    that she “would be hard pressed to stand up here and argue that the first
    prong of the test in the <i>Rowbotham</i> application isn’t met in terms
    of both the complexity of the case and the circumstances of the applicant”.  She
    pointed out that she had conceded in her factum that the case was “very complex”;
    there would be three, possibly four expert witnesses and a similar fact application.  She
    told the trial judge that the applicant worked at a stamping plant and appeared
    to recognize that the appellant would have difficulty cross-examining even
    the straightforward witnesses let alone the expert witnesses.  When pressed
    by the trial judge as to whether she was conceding the first branch of the <i>Rowbotham </i>test,
    Crown counsel said this:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Well I am conceding at this point that this is
    a very complex case, if that’s of assistance to Your Honour, that there are
    several different forms of evidence that are going to be called in this case
    which I would concede at this point would be difficult for a lay person.
    Am I ready to say impossible at this point, or that he wouldn’t be, he wouldn’t
    in any way receive a fair trial if he didn’t have counsel? I’m not conceding
    that.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>THE COURT: Okay.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Crown Counsel: But it’s a probabilities test, I’ll
    leave it to Your Honour, but I am conceding that it’s a very complex case.
    And as I said at the beginning, I’d be hard pressed to stand up here and
    argue that without the assistance of counsel the fairness would definitely
    be infringed, if I can leave it at that.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge appeared at this point to interpret the Crown’s position as a
    concession that the first branch of the <i>Rowbotham </i>test had been met
    and therefore she moved on to the second branch.  The appellant then filed
    his financial documents.  The trial judge stated that she would look at the
    material and “decide whether we need to go further” and produce the documents
    to the Crown.  She said she would make a preliminary review and then adjourned
    to review the materials.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    the trial judge returned she ruled that the appellant had not met the first
    branch of the <i>Rowbotham</i> test.  She ruled that the appellant would
    not be deprived of a fair trial if he did not have counsel.  I will more
    fully set out the trial judge’s reasons below.  Suffice it to say, it is
    my view that the trial judge reached that conclusion because she applied
    too stringent a test.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Introduction</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    say at once that save for the problem that the appellant was without counsel
    for a serious and complex case, the trial judge did everything possible to
    assist the unrepresented appellant.  She went out of her way to explain each
    procedural step to the appellant as the trial progressed.  She identified
    potential evidentiary and <i>Charter</i> issues that might favour the appellant.  She
    took care to ensure that the appellant had what ever time he required to
    prepare.  For example, on the first day of evidence, all of the witnesses
    that the Crown expected to call that day had testified by the lunch hour
    break.  Since the appellant was not ready to deal with any further witnesses,
    the trial judge directed Crown counsel not to call further witnesses that
    day.  Instead, the trial judge used the time after the lunch break to give
    the appellant an extended explanation of the procedure that would be followed
    on the voluntariness <i>voir dire </i>that was to take place the following
    day.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>When
    the appellant requested some further information relating to one of the witnesses,
    the trial judge ensured that the police obtained the information for him.  At
    every stage, the trial judge erred on the side of caution in respect of any
    questionable Crown evidence to ensure that the evidence was properly admissible.  At
    the conclusion of the trial, the trial judge gave full and comprehensive
    reasons.  She addressed the arguments put forward by the appellant and any
    other arguments that might have enured to the benefit of the appellant.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    short, the trial judge conducted a model trial for an unrepresented accused.  However,
    the question is whether in the circumstances of this case, there was an appearance
    of unfairness because the appellant was required to proceed without counsel. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The <i>Rowbotham</i> test</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R.
      v. Rowbotham</i> (1988), 41 C.C.C. (3d) 1 at 69, this court held that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[A] trial judge confronted with an <i>exceptional
      case where legal aid has been refused, and who is of the opinion that representation
      of the accused by counsel is essential to a fair trial</i>, may, upon being
      satisfied that the accused lacks the means to employ counsel, stay the
      proceedings against the accused until the necessary funding of counsel
      is provided. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether
    the issue is financial ability or the necessity for counsel, the trial judge
    in considering whether to appoint counsel is not engaged in reviewing the
    decision of the legal aid authorities.  As this court said in <i>R. v. Peterman</i> (2004),
    70 O.R. (3d) 481 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) at para. 22:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[W]hen a court makes a <i>Rowbotham</i> order,
    it is not conducting some kind of judicial review of decisions made by legal
    aid authorities. Rather, it is fulfilling its independent obligation to ensure
    that the accused receives a fair trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    considering whether to appoint counsel the trial judge is required to consider
    the seriousness of the charges, the length and complexity of the proceedings
    and the accused’s ability to participate effectively and defend the case.  Because
    of the pervasiveness of legal aid, it will be the rare and exceptional case
    that the court will find it necessary to appoint counsel.  This does not
    mean that counsel is only required in exceptional cases.  Rather, it is the
    fact that legal aid is available for accused who cannot afford a lawyer that <i>Rowbotham</i> orders
    are exceptional.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Courts
    have considered a number of factors in determining whether appointing counsel
    is essential in view of the complexity and seriousness of the case.  Generally,
    the courts look at the personal abilities of the accused such as their education
    and employment background, their ability to read and their facility with
    the language of the proceedings. The courts will also consider the complexity
    of the evidence; the procedural, evidentiary and substantive law that applies
    to the case; the likelihood of especially complex procedures such as a <i>voir
    dire</i>; the seriousness of the charges; the expected length of the trial;
    and the likelihood of imprisonment:  see <i>R. v. Wood</i> (2001), 191 N.S.R.
    (2d) 201 (C.A.); <i>R. v. Wilson</i> (1997), 163 N.S.R. (2d) 206 (C.A.); <i>R.
    v. Hayes</i> (2002), 253 N.B.R. (2d) 299 (C.A.); <i>R. v. Drury</i> (2001),
    150
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    Man. R. (2d) 64 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ); <i>R. v. Rain</i> (1998), 223 A.R. 359 (
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) and <i>R. v. Chemama</i>, 2008 ONCJ 31.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    considering whether counsel is essential, the court will also take into account
    the prosecution’s duty to make full disclosure and the trial judge’s obligation
    to assist the unrepresented accused: see <i>R. v.
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Wilson</i> and <i>R. v. Keating</i> (1997), 159 N.S.R. (2d) 357&nbsp;(C.A.).</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The test applied by the trial judge</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the trial judge did not apply the correct test.  After noting that
    the threshold for appointing counsel is “very high”, she said the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>As it was put in <i>R. v. Rowbotham</i> (1988),
    41 C.C.C. (3d) 1, p.&nbsp;61:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-subquote><span style='font-size:12.0pt'>In an <i>extreme</i> case,
      that power [the power to appoint counsel for an indigent accused] may exist
      where a trial judge is satisfied that the decision by Legal Aid not to
      grant a counsel certificate is <i>completely perverse</i>, given the accused's
      financial situation, the complexity and length of the trial, and the <i>substantial</i> possibility
      of <i>lengthy</i> imprisonment.  </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[My emphasis]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge then went on to describe a case where counsel should be appointed
    as one posing,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='
line-height:normal;'><u>[U]nique</u> challenges above
    and beyond those that would ordinarily be expected in a criminal trial. Were
    it otherwise, an enormous number of self-represented individuals might well
    be entitled to state funded counsel, thereby causing a serious interference
    with the administration of the state sponsored Legal Aid Plan. [Emphasis
    added.] </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>Ultimately, she was not satisfied that this was “one
    of those unique and extraordinary cases in which the presence of counsel
    is a prerequisite to a fair trial”.  The trial judge concluded as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In light of the stringent test that must be met
    to satisfy the first prong of <i>Rowbotham</i>, the role of the trial judge
    in rendering necessary assistance to Mr. Rushlow, and the extra added duty
    of fairness resting upon Crown counsel, I am not satisfied that the absence
    of legal counsel will have the effect of depriving Mr. Rushlow of a fair
    trial in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the trial judge applied too stringent a test.  This court has never
    said that a <i>Rowbotham</i> order is limited to an extreme case where Legal
    Aid’s decision is completely perverse and there is a substantial possibility
    of lengthy imprisonment.  The passage from <i>Rowbotham</i> quoted by the
    trial judge is from the reasons of the trial judge in that case.  This court
    did not endorse that test.  Nor need the case be one posing “unique challenges”.  The
    authorities hold that the case must be of some complexity, but a requirement
    of unique challenges puts the threshold too high.  It is enough that there
    is a probability of imprisonment and that the case is sufficiently complex
    that counsel is essential to ensure that the accused receives a fair trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    am also concerned that the test adopted by the trial judge may have placed
    undue weight on the impact her order might have on the administration of
    legal aid.  As pointed out above, when considering whether to make an order
    appointing counsel, the trial judge does not sit in review of decisions of
    the legal aid authorities.  It was not the trial judge’s concern how the
    decision to appoint counsel in this case would impact on Legal Aid

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Was the test met in this case?</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the first branch of the <i>Rowbotham </i>test was met in this case.  Crown
    counsel at trial essentially conceded that the case was complex and that
    the appellant did not have the capacity to defend the case without counsel.  The
    central issue in the case was whether the fire had been deliberately set.  The
    Crown intended to call 30 witnesses to prove motive and opportunity, including
    at least three expert witnesses to prove that the fire was not accidental.  As
    I will explain later, while the appellant could handle cross-examination
    of many of the witnesses, he was out of his depth when it came to the expert
    evidence.  Further, the Crown intended to tender similar fact evidence and
    lead evidence of several statements the appellant made to persons in authority.  As
    to the appellant’s personal circumstances, he had no legal training.  It
    was unclear what his level of formal education was and all that was before
    the trial judge was that he worked in a stamping plant.  It was also unclear
    whether the appellant had any prior experience with the justice system, other
    than the preliminary inquiry in this case.  As it turned out, the pre-sentence
    report prepared at the conclusion of the trial indicates that the appellant
    has a Grade 11 education and that he had no prior criminal record.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the case was a serious one.  A conviction for arson in these circumstances
    usually results in a prison term and that was the result in this case.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The financial branch of the test</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge did not address the issue of whether the appellant met the financial
    branch of the test.  The appellant has filed fresh evidence demonstrating
    that he is impecunious.  The material also indicates the attempts the appellant
    made to obtain legal aid and to make arrangements to privately retain counsel
    before trial.  The appellant was refused legal aid and his appeal to the
    area committee was refused.  He theoretically had one further appeal to the
    provincial office. However, as duty counsel pointed out to the trial judge,
    given that his financial position had not changed since his initial application,
    it was unlikely he would qualify for legal aid.  The appellant had offered
    to enter into a contribution agreement with Legal Aid.  The attempts to retain
    counsel privately appear to have foundered on counsel’s need for a retainer
    beyond the appellant’s means.  The appellant had a large number of debts
    and as a result of the fire had lost most of his possessions.  Indeed, it
    was the Crown’s position that the motive for the fire was that the appellant
    was in desperate financial circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for the respondent points out some shortcomings in the fresh evidence.  In
    particular, the appellant seems to have consulted only one counsel after
    the preliminary inquiry.  He also acquired some debts after the fire, so
    that money that might have been used to retain counsel was unavailable.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Perhaps
    the appellant could have made further efforts to privately retain counsel
    and he may have made some poor financial decisions.  However, I accept the
    very fair concession from counsel for the respondent, which is stated in
    these terms in her factum:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This is not a case in which the appellant’s finances
    reveal that he could have retained counsel and made a calculated decision
    not to.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Conclusion</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the appellant has shown that the trial judge erred in law in her
    application of the first branch of the <i>Rowbotham</i> test.  He has also
    shown that on proper application of the test, the assistance of counsel was
    essential to a fair trial.  I am also satisfied that had the trial judge
    reached the second branch of the test, consideration of the financial circumstances
    of the appellant, it is probable that she would have found that the appellant
    lacked the financial resources to retain counsel for the trial.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The test for granting a new trial on appeal </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    appeal, counsel for the appellant and for the Crown presented opposing views
    as to the test this court should apply, if the court found that the trial
    judge had erred in failing to grant the <i>Rowbotham</i> application.  Crown
    counsel submits that the court has the advantage of hindsight.  Thus, if
    we are convinced that the appellant in fact had a fair trial, the appeal
    should be dismissed.  Crown counsel in effect submits that the appellant
    must demonstrate prejudice in the sense that but for the lack of counsel,
    the result would have been different.  Counsel for the appellant submits
    that if the appellant was wrongly deprived of counsel, the appeal must be
    allowed because he has been deprived of a substantive and constitutional
    right.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with Crown counsel that this court cannot ignore that fact that the
    trial has taken place and this court has the benefit of the transcript of
    the proceedings.  See <i>R. v. Widdifield</i> (1995), 25 O.R. (3d) 161 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) at 175-76. However, as I will explain below, I do not agree that the appellant
    must show actual prejudice, that is, that the result might have been different
    had he had counsel, for this court to order a new trial.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is a further complication in considering the test to be applied on appeal.
    There are three potential bases for this appeal. If the appellant’s case
    is considered as a breach of a constitutional right, the remedy on appeal
    may lie with s. 24(1) of the <i>Charter</i>: see <i>R. v. Tran</i>, [1994]
    2 S.C.R. 951, at 1009-1010.  However, I have also found that the trial judge
    erred in law in applying the test for whether counsel should be appointed.  If
    that error of law falls within s. 686(1)(a)(ii) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>,
    the burden falls on the Crown to persuade this court that no miscarriage
    of justice resulted pursuant to s. 686(1)(b)(iii).  Alternatively, it may
    be that the better approach is to determine whether the appellant has shown
    that the lack of counsel resulted in a miscarriage of justice within the
    meaning of s. 686(1)(a)(iii).  That was the approach adopted by the Manitoba
    Court of Appeal in <i>Drury</i> at para. 20:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In the case at hand, which does not concern a prospective
    s. 7 breach, but rather where the trial has already proceeded, the appropriate
    remedy would be to quash the conviction if, in the opinion of the Court,
    the lack of representation of an accused by counsel at trial resulted in
    a miscarriage of justice. <i>A miscarriage of justice within s. 613(1)(a)(iii)
    of the Code occurs where there is an appearance of unfairness in the trial
    of an accused</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, I do not find it necessary to resolve the question of the proper
    approach this court must take.  I am satisfied that there has been a miscarriage
    of justice in this case,  in that the failure to appoint counsel resulted
    in an appearance of unfairness and that the appropriate remedy must be a
    new trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether
    the issue on appeal is viewed from the perspective of an error of law or
    possible miscarriage of justice, the fact that constitutional rights are
    involved must be borne in mind. In <i>Rowbotham</i>, at p. 70,  this court
    described the right recognized in that case in these terms:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>To sum up: where the trial judge finds that representation
    of an accused by counsel is essential to a fair trial, the accused, as previously
    indicated, <i>has a constitutional right to be provided with counsel at the
    expense of the state</i> if he or she lacks the means to employ one. Where
    the trial judge is satisfied that an accused lacks the means to employ counsel,
    and that counsel is necessary to ensure a fair trial for the accused, a stay
    of the proceedings until funded counsel is provided is an appropriate remedy
    under s. 24(1) of the Charter where the prosecution insists on proceeding
    with the trial in breach of the accused's Charter right to a fair trial.
    [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    follows that the approach to be taken on appeal must recognize that the appellant’s
    constitutional right to counsel was infringed.  This court has dealt with
    the constitutional right to counsel in the context of a case where the accused
    had been wrongly deprived of his right to counsel of choice.  In <i>R. v.
    McCallen</i> (1999), 43 O.R. (3d) 56 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) there was no suggestion that the accused had not been competently represented
    by counsel or that his trial was in fact, unfair.  Applying <i>Tran</i>,
    a case where an accused had been deprived of his right to an interpreter
    as guaranteed by s.&nbsp;14 of the <i>Charter</i>, this court held that it
    was not necessary for the accused to demonstrate prejudice to obtain a new
    trial.  Rather, a new trial was required “to protect and vindicate the right
    that has been breached and to ensure the perception of fairness of the proceeding”: <i>McCallen</i>,
    at p. 79.  The court also relied on cases from this court where the trial
    judge had unduly interfered in the trial and the interference seriously impaired
    the appearance of fairness of the trial and cases where the accused had been
    improperly excluded from the trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    said, the court must take a purposive approach to the issue.  The <i>McCallen</i> problem
    involved interference by the trial court with a constitutionally protected
    decision.  That interference itself led to the appearance of unfairness,
    irrespective of the actual conduct of the trial.  Similarly, the cases concerned
    with wrongful exclusion of the accused take into account that more is at
    stake than simply the impact on the accused’s ability to make full answer
    and defence.  It is sufficient that exclusion of the accused from a part
    of the proceedings where their vital interests were involved affects the
    appearance of the fairness of the proceedings.  The same reasoning was applied
    in <i>Tran</i>.  Having been denied his right to an interpreter, the appellant
    was effectively excluded from his trial.  As the court in <i>Tran</i> said
    at p. 97, the right to an interpreter “is one which is intimately related
    to our basic notions of justice, including the appearance of fairness”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    purpose of the right to counsel in the context of a <i>Rowbotham</i> case
    is reflected in the nature of the test itself.  Counsel is appointed because
    their assistance is essential for a fair trial.  In my view, fair trial in
    this context embraces both the concept of the ability to make full answer
    and defence and the appearance of fairness.  In the context of ability to
    make full answer and defence, the court must, however, be wary of speculating
    as to how the case might have been different had counsel been appointed.  As
    Lamer&nbsp;C.J.C. said in <i>Tran </i>at p. 994-995:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>To second-guess the defence's strategy in a
      particular case, or to ponder the utility of proper interpretation, is
      an inherently dangerous exercise. It is impossible to know for sure what
      would have happened</i> if an accused had been provided with full and contemporaneous
      interpretation of the proceeding in question. For example, one can never
      really know what might have been triggered in an accused's mind had he
      or she received the interpretation to which he or she is entitled under
      s. 14 of the <i>Charter</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly,
    pondering the utility of assistance of defence counsel in a complex case
    is an inherently dangerous exercise. The lack of utility in speculating as
    to how counsel might have affected the result can be illustrated in relation
    to the legal rulings made by the trial judge in this case.  Counsel for the
    respondent points out that in this case the appellant does not challenge
    any of the various evidentiary rulings made by the trial judge during the
    trial.  In my view, it is not necessary for the appellant to be able to establish
    that any of the legal rulings by the trial judge were wrong in order to obtain
    a new trial.  If any of the rulings were legally wrong, that could form an
    independent ground of appeal, which on its own could lead to a new trial
    unless the Crown was able to establish that no substantial wrong or miscarriage
    of justice occurred.  But to paraphrase the words of Lamer C.J.C. in <i>Tran</i>,
    one can never really know what would have happened had the appellant had
    counsel to argue any of those rulings.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Take,
    for example, the similar fact ruling.  A trial judge’s decision to admit
    similar fact evidence is entitled to “substantial deference”: <i>R. v. H</i>andy,
    [2002] 2 S.C.R. 908 at para. 153.  That means there is a broad range within
    which the trial judge’s ruling is immune from appellate interference.  That
    also means, however, that counsel’s assistance during the argument at trial
    is crucial.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the appellant had some difficulty articulating his objection to
    the similar fact evidence and attempted to give evidence during his submissions
    about the automobile fires and the claims.  He did not call any evidence
    on the <i>voir dire</i>.  Defence counsel might have sought to call evidence
    on the <i>voir dire</i> or in some way challenge the statement of facts relied
    upon by Crown counsel.  Defence counsel might have been able to persuade
    the trial judge to weigh the probative value and prejudicial effect of that
    evidence differently. Finally, it is difficult to know what, if any, impact
    the admission of the similar fact evidence had on the appellant’s decision
    to testify.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    other area of complexity concerns the expert evidence.  Although Crown counsel
    initially indicated that she intended to call three or possibly four expert
    witnesses, in the end she called two: the Fire Marshall and the Electrical
    Safety Inspector.  During his cross-examination of the two witnesses, the
    appellant was able to identify two discrepancies in their evidence.  The
    Fire Marshall testified that the sub-panel in the area of the fire had four
    fuses and that the Inspector examined all four.  He also testified that he
    removed the sub-panel from the wall on September 12.  The Inspector testified,
    however, that he examined only three fuses and that while he searched for
    the fourth fuse he could not find it.  The Inspector also testified that
    he examined the sub-panel while it was still on the wall, even though his
    examination took place on September 13.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for the respondent points to the appellant’s cross-examination of the experts
    as demonstrating that the appellant effectively cross-examined the experts
    and that assistance of counsel was not essential.  I do not take the same
    view of the effectiveness of the cross-examination or its impact on the issue
    of the need for assistance of counsel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant approached the discrepancies between the Fire Marshal and the Inspector
    as a lay person might.  That approach is captured in his question to the
    Inspector:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Q.        So my next question, which one of you
    two are not telling us the truth?  Somebody here is lying Your Honour …</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    approach was carried forward in the appellant’s brief submissions at the
    conclusion of the trial.  After submitting that there was no way that the
    Inspector could properly examine the electrical panel because of what the
    Fire Marshall had done the day before, the appellant asked the trial judge “to
    exclude all testimony” from the Fire Marshal and the Inspector.  He submitted
    that there were major inconsistencies and the Inspector “lied as to the location
    of the panel and the examination”.  He submitted that both witnesses “both
    had time to know that their reports and statements are not true”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    the appellant was able to point to at least two discrepancies in the evidence
    of the two experts.  Unfortunately, the appellant was unable to make effective
    use of the discrepancies.  Not surprisingly, he saw the issue as essentially
    a matter of fabrication of evidence.  He was unable to leverage the inconsistencies
    into an effective defence or undermine the ultimate opinion of the experts.  Put
    simply, he was unable to show how the discrepancies or inconsistencies mattered.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Not
    surprisingly, the trial judge treated the discrepancies as essentially matters
    of credibility.  She concluded that the two witnesses had “done their best
    to present an honest recollection of the relevant events in their evidence
    before this court”.  She was satisfied that these discrepancies “are not
    such as to warrant the rejection of the experts’
    conclusions”.  She pointed out that the Fire Marshal in particular had expressed
    some uncertainty about the fourth fuse and she repeated that the “inconsistencies
    relied upon by the defence are a natural bi-product of the process of honest
    recollection”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    this record, while it was open to the trial judge to approach the evidence
    in that manner, that simply exposes the problem brought about by the appellant
    not having the assistance of counsel to lay a proper foundation to challenge
    the expert evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    have one last concern with the question of full answer and defence and the
    appearance of fairness.  The appellant did not testify and did not call any
    evidence.  From my review of the transcript, it appears that the appellant’s
    theory was that the fire was a result of an electrical fault or caused by
    something that was done during the renovations he was doing on the second
    floor.  Unfortunately, that position was never really developed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not say that in every case where the trial judge erred in failing to make
    a <i>Rowbotham</i> order there must be a new trial.  There may be cases where
    the case as prosecuted was so different from the case as presented at the
    time of the <i>Rowbotham</i> application that it can be safely said that
    not only did the accused receive a fair trial but the appearance of fairness
    of the trial was not compromised.    For example, if the only basis for appointing
    counsel was that there was a complex evidentiary issue but the trial judge
    had ruled in favour of the defence, it could well be argued that there was
    no damage to the appearance of fairness.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, this case was one where the appellant required counsel to effectively
    defend the case.  It was a very serious matter and resulted in a one-year
    prison sentence.  The lack of assistance of counsel impaired the appearance
    of fairness and possibly the ability to make full answer and defence and
    in that sense resulted in a miscarriage of justice. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>DISPOSITION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I would allow the appeal, set aside the convictions and order a new trial.  If
    the appellant is once again refused legal aid, and he renews his <i>Rowbotham</i> application,
    it will be for the trial judge to determine whether the appellant has met
    the financial branch of the test in light of his current circumstances.</p>
