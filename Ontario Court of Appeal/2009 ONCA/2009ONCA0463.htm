  <h4><span lang=EN-US>A.        INTRODUCTION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    question on this appeal is whether the trial judge erred by using the accused’s
    silence as a basis to find his evidence not credible.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant, Ryan Rohde, lived alone in a small one-bedroom condominium, which
    he owned.  One weekend in April 2006, he went away for a few days.  While
    he was away water leaked into his condominium unit, causing extensive flooding.  The
    superintendent of the building fixed the leak and arranged for a cleaning
    crew to clean up the unit.  During the clean up, the crew discovered an unloaded
    sawed-off shotgun under Mr. Rohde’s bed.  Mr. Rohde was arrested upon his
    return to the condominium.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Rohde was charged with possession of an unlicensed firearm and careless storage
    of a firearm.  He was tried a year later, and pleaded not guilty.  He testified
    that the gun was not his and that he did not know where it had come from.  He
    said that an acquaintance had used his condominium shortly before the leak
    occurred.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found Mr. Rohde guilty and imposed a four-month conditional sentence.  In
    her reasons for conviction, the trial judge rejected Mr. Rohde’s evidence
    as incredible because he did not come forward earlier with his explanation
    that someone else had been in his condominium unit.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Rohde’s main argument on his conviction appeal is that in rejecting his evidence
    the trial judge infringed his constitutional right to silence.  I agree with
    this argument, and for that reason would allow Mr. Rohde’s appeal and order
    a new trial.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>B.        MR. ROHDE’S EXPLANATION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      the year leading up to the trial, Mr. Rohde offered no explanation for
      how the shotgun got under his bed.  At trial, however, he explained that
      John Ahmae, whom he knew from playing in a men’s basketball league at the
      YMCA, had asked to stay at his condominium for a week.  According to Mr.
      Rohde, Mr. Ahmae had just broken up with his girlfriend and was moving
      into a new place.  He was looking for somewhere to stay until his new place
      was ready.  Mr. Rohde allowed Mr. Ahmae to stay at his condominium and
      gave him the keys.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Mr.
      Rohde testified that he tried to telephone Mr. Ahmae but his phone seemed
      to have been turned off and he had no answering machine.  Mr. Rohde said
      he never heard from Mr. Ahmae again.  In Mr. Rohde’s words, “he disappeared
      into thin air.”</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>C.        THE TRIAL JUDGE’S REASONS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      shotgun was unlicensed.  To prove Mr. Rohde guilty of possession of it,
      the Crown had to prove both knowledge and control.  The trial judge correctly
      recognized that the Crown had a strong case on possession – in her words,
      the Crown had “nailed it down four squared.”  The gun was found under Mr.
      Rohde’s bed in a condominium unit that he alone owned and occupied.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However,
      Mr. Rohde provided an exculpatory explanation for the gun.  The trial judge
      had to decide whether Mr. Rohde’s explanation raised a reasonable doubt
      about his guilt.  She held that it did not.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>She
      characterized Mr. Rohde’s explanation as “almost the equivalent of an alibi,
      I was not there and I did not do it and this guy was there.”  She then
      rejected his explanation principally because he never told the police or
      anyone else about it.  No one, therefore, had an opportunity to investigate
      Mr. Rohde’s story.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      following passages from the trial judge’s brief reasons are the basis for
      her rejection of Mr. Rohde’s evidence:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Now, Mr. Rohde comes here today
      and says: “I gave my keys to my friend John, but he is not really a friend.  He
      fixed my car a couple of times.  We played basketball together.  I had
      known him for one and a half to two years.  My only contact was a phone
      number.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Oh, by the way, I did not mention
      anything to the police about this and I asked around about this, but nobody
      I asked around about it is here today.  And when his phone number did not
      work, I asked my friends and just did not take any other steps.”  Those
      steps of his have to be assessed in what a reasonably prudent person in
      this circumstance might do.</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO><span lang=EN-US>And:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>If you loan your home to someone
      you happen to know, and are arrested for a sawed-off shotgun, I find that
      the steps that Mr. Rohde says that he took to attempt to locate this John
      or identify him do not make any rational or reasonable sense to me.  It
      just does not hold together.  It is almost the equivalent of an alibi,
      I was not there and I did not do it and this guy was there.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Usually, in those circumstances,
      if you were going to say it was X, but you cannot locate him, somebody
      must be given the opportunity to investigate that story and for this man
      to come in here a couple of years later while it was a guy named John and
      that is all I know about it, please believe me, it does not have the ring
      of truth or reality to it.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>For those reasons, I do not accept
      his evidence in that regard. </span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>D.        DISCUSSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Rohde submits that the trial judge erred by using his silence – his failure
    to tell his story to the police – as the basis for rejecting his evidence.  As
    I have said, I agree with this submission.  In my view, the trial judge erred
    because she assessed Mr. Rohde’s credibility as if he had put forward an
    alibi defence when he had not done so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    person accused of a crime has a constitutional right to silence under s.
    7 of the <i>Charter</i>.  An accused is entitled to exercise that right when
    subjected to the coercive power of the state.  Thus, the right generally
    comes into effect on an accused’s arrest, charge or detention.  See <i>R.
    v. Hebert</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 151.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    accused’s pre-trial right to silence has important implications at trial.  Ordinarily,
    an accused’s decision to exercise the right to silence should not be used
    at trial as probative of an accused’s guilt or as a basis for rejecting the
    accused’s evidence.  To do so would undermine the right.  As Cory J. said
    in <i>R. v. Chambers</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1293, at p. 1316, “it would be
    a snare and a delusion” to say that the accused has a right to silence, yet
    use that silence to find the accused guilty.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the principle from <i>Chambers</i> has limited exceptions.  One exception
    is the defence of alibi.  If an accused does not adequately disclose an alibi
    defence early enough to allow the police to investigate it before trial,
    then the trier of fact may infer that the accused’s defence is not credible.  See <i>R.
    v. Noble</i>, [1997] 1 S.C.R. 874.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the trial judge seemed to appreciate that Mr. Rohde had not put forward an
    alibi defence – she said it as “almost the equivalent of an alibi” – she
    nonetheless treated Mr. Rohde’s explanation as if it were an alibi.  She
    discounted his explanation – indeed, rejected it entirely – because he had
    not disclosed it to the police so they could investigate it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unquestionably,
    Mr. Rohde’s defence was not alibi.  An alibi defence is a defence that says
    that the accused was elsewhere when the crime took place.  If accepted, or
    if it raises a reasonable doubt, an alibi is determinative of the accused’s
    innocence.  See <i>R. v. Hill</i> (1995), 25 O.R. (3d) 97.  However, that
    Mr. Rohde was elsewhere when the shotgun was found under his bed would not
    exonerate him.  The issue in the case was not alibi but whether Mr. Rohde
    had the required knowledge and control over the shotgun to be in possession
    of it.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    trier of fact is not justified in applying the principles for assessing an
    accused’s credibility where the defence is alibi to a case where the defence
    is not alibi.  By linking her rejection of Mr. Rohde’s evidence to his pre-trial
    silence, the trial judge committed a reversible error.  She violated his
    constitutional right not to say anything.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Recently,
    in <i>R. v. Palmer</i>, 2008 ONCA 797, this court adopted a similar view.  The
    accused, Ms. Palmer, had been charged with possession of cocaine for the
    purpose of trafficking and possession of the proceeds of crime.  At trial,
    she gave an exculpatory explanation for her possession of the cocaine.  In
    rejecting her explanation, the trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>This is not a case of the Court being critical
    of someone not speaking.  That of course is their inalienable right not to
    speak to police, but having chosen to do so, she failed to avail herself
    of the opportunity to offer an explanation which she now advances was so
    simple and obvious to give.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In my view, that failure to do so serves to diminish
    any weight to be given to her explanation now offered and her explanation
    is rejected based on these reasons.  Having rejected her evidence, neither
    am I left in any doubt by it when considered together with the evidence as
    a whole.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    court held, at para. 9, that the trial judge erred by using Ms. Palmer’s
    silence to reject her evidence:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It was open to the trial judge to reject the appellant’s
    explanation given at trial because it was not believable and to use that
    finding in assessing the appellant’s overall credibility.  However, the trial
    judge went further and used the appellant’s silence as a basis for finding
    her incredible.  That he was not entitled to do.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Our
    court set aside Ms. Palmer’s conviction and ordered a new trial.  Similarly,
    in the present case, I would set aside Mr. Rohde’s conviction and order a
    new trial.</p>
