  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant, Wycliffe Humberplex Limited,  appeals from part of an order made
    by Pepall J., dated September 10, 2008, in which she ordered that the respondent,
    Humberplex Developments Inc., is not required to pay to the City of Vaughan
    and the Regional Municipality of York certain development charges due on
    certain lots now owned by the appellant.  Both Wycliffe and Humberplex, respondents
    in the original application, were the moving party and respondent respectively
    in the motion before Pepall J. That motion is the subject of this appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, the appeal is allowed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>Background</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent is the developer of 170 lots in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Kleinberg,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario.  On October 16, 2003, the appellant purchased 88 of the Kleinberg
    lots from the respondent. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    parties recognized that, in order to develop the lots, development charges
    would have to be paid to the City of Vaughan (the
    “City”) and the Regional Municipality of York (the “Municipality”). Pursuant
    to s. 6.1(b) of the Agreement of Purchase and Sale, the parties agreed to
    pay the development charges as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The vendor shall…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b)  <u>Levies</u> - Pay or provide appropriate
    security for payment of levies, all development charges, capital contributions
    and imposts (collectively called the “Levies”) <i>prerequisite to obtaining
    the registration of the Plan of Subdivision</i> (excluding education development
    charges, GO Transit development charges, building permit fees, damage, grading  or
    occupancy deposits or inspection fees relating to construction or occupancy
    which  are all the responsibility of the Purchaser) as required to be paid
    pursuant to the Subdivision Agreement equivalent to the amount of such levies,
    as of the date of acceptance of this Agreement.  The Purchaser shall be responsible
    for the payment of the increase of such levies and/or the whole amount of
    any new or other levy, contribution, impost or development charge, fee or
    assessment, the nature or amount of which was not in existence as of the
    date of execution of this Agreement…[emphasis added].</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    order to register the Plan of Subdivision, the respondent was required to
    enter into a Development Charge Agreement with the Municipality, which it
    did on June 16, 2005.  The Development Charge Agreement provides for the
    payment of Residential Development Charges, classified into two components:
    (1) hard services, which include sanitary, water supply and regional road
    services; and (2) general services, which include police, emergency medical,
    long term care, public health, and public works services, capital growth
    studies, and transit infrastructure.  The Residential Development Charges
    are governed by the <i>Development Charges Act</i>, <i>1997</i>, S.O. 1997,
    c. 27 and By-law No. DC-0005-2003-050.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Subsections
    4(1) and 4(2) of the Development Charge Agreement specify the method of payment
    required for the Residential Development Charges. Subsection 4(1) provides
    that the hard services component of the development charges is due immediately
    upon entering into the agreement.
     Subsection 4(2) provides that the general services component is due upon
    the issuance of a building permit in respect of a lot or block of lots in
    the final Plan of Subdivision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Additionally,
    in order to get final approval of the Plan of Subdivision and to have it
    registered, the respondent was also required to enter into a Subdivision
    Agreement with the City.  The Subdivision Agreement was signed on January
    11, 2006, and requires, <i>inter alia</i>, the payment of certain development
    charges to the City. Schedule “I”
    to the Subdivision Agreement is entitled “…TO BE PAID BY THE OWNER PRIOR
    TO FINAL APPROVAL OF THE PLAN”.  It provides that development charges and
    a special services area charge are payable to the City in accordance with
    the City of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Vaughan Development Charges By-law and s. 21.1.1 of the Subdivision Agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    City of Vaughan Development Charges By-law lists the various types of development
    charges payable to the City. Section 21.1.1 of the Subdivision Agreement
    provides that both the engineering services and special services area components
    of the development charges are payable immediately upon entering into the
    agreement.  The section further provides that the balance of the development
    charges is payable on the date that a building permit is issued.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Upon
    signing both the Development Charge Agreement and the Subdivision Agreement,
    the respondent paid the development charges due immediately to the Municipality
    and the City. The Plan of Subdivision was registered on March 26, 2006.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Between
    March 2006 and June 2008, the respondent paid the outstanding development
    charges in respect of 69 of the appellant’s lots for which building permits
    were issued.  In August 2008, the appellant requested that the respondent
    pay the outstanding development charges on four lots totalling $22,036.00.
    When the respondent refused, the appellant paid the charges without prejudice
    to its position to seek reimbursement from the respondent.  Currently, the
    remaining development charges on 19 lots are at issue (including the four
    lots for which the appellant has paid the charges), totalling $104,671.00. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>Decision of the Motion Judge</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    the motion judge, the parties agreed that the determination of the issue
    turned on the proper interpretation of the phrase
    “prerequisite to obtaining the registration of the Plan of Subdivision” in
    s. 6.1(b) of the Agreement of Purchase and
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Sale.  In interpreting this phrase, the motion judge stated that the language
    must be given meaning.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge reviewed the agreements and noted that both the Development
    Charge Agreement and the Subdivision Agreement distinguished between development
    charges payable as a prerequisite to registration and those payable post-registration.  She
    also reviewed letters submitted as evidence from the City and the Municipality
    which suggested that both were satisfied that all payments prerequisite to
    registration of the Plan of Subdivision had been paid.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    this basis, the motion judge concluded that the respondent was not required
    to pay the development charges in respect of the 19 lots.  The development
    charges previously paid by the respondent in respect of the other 69 lots
    were not at issue as they had been resolved as part of an earlier settlement
    agreement between the parties.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>Positions of the Parties</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the motion judge erred in her interpretation of the
    phrase “prerequisite to obtaining the registration of the Plan of Subdivision” in
    s. 6.1(b) of the Agreement of Purchase and
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Sale.  It argues that this phrase refers to the panoply of obligations assumed
    by the respondent in order to obtain registration of the Plan of Subdivision.  Although
    the Development Charge Agreement and the Subdivision Agreement allowed the
    respondent to defer payment of some of the development charges, the Plan
    of Subdivision would not have been registered if the respondent had not agreed
    to pay those charges in full.  The appellant asserts that the serialization
    of payments does not remove the obligation to make the payment, which always
    existed as a requirement to obtaining registration of the Plan of Subdivision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    the appellant argues that the motion judge misinterpreted the substance of
    the letters from the City and the Municipality. It submits that the letters
    can only be read as confirmation that the payments prerequisite to registration
    of the Plan of the Subdivision that were due immediately had been paid.  The
    other charges prerequisite to registration of the Plan of Subdivision, due
    at a later date, had not been paid by the respondent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent’s position is that s. 6.1(b) of the Agreement of Purchase and
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Sale does not require it to pay all of the development charges.  However,
    the respondent conceded in oral argument that its original obligation to
    the Municipality and the City was to pay the entire amount of the development
    charges. Nevertheless, it submits that s. 6.1(b) of the Agreement of Purchase
    and
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Sale divides the development charges into
    “portions”, and that the payment structures provided for in the Subdivision
    Agreement and the Development Charge Agreement indicate that the respondent’s
    “portion” of the development charges was due immediately upon entering into
    the agreements, as a prerequisite to registration.  Following these two initial
    payments, the Plan of Subdivision was registered and the respondent’s obligation
    under s. 6.1(b) was fulfilled.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    support its position, the respondent relies on provisions in both the Development
    Charge Agreement and the Subdivision Agreement which state that the terms
    of the agreements are to be enforceable against the parties, their successors
    and assigns.  It submits that whatever obligations the respondent had to
    the City and the Municipality run with the land and are binding on the appellant.  Additionally,
    pursuant to s. 7.1(d) of the Agreement of Purchase and
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Sale, the appellant accepted title to the lands subject to the Subdivision
    Agreement and the Development Charge Agreement and agreed to comply with
    those agreements. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent also relies on the letters provided by the City and the Municipality
    to support its contention that both the City and the Municipality consider
    all charges prerequisite to registration of the Plan of Subdivision to have
    been paid.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>Analysis</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge proceeded correctly on the basis of the position taken by the
    parties in argument before her, that is, that the case turned on the interpretation
    to be placed on the phrase “prerequisite to obtaining the registration” in
    s. 6.1(b) of the Agreement of Purchase and
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Sale. In my view, there are two possible meanings to be given to the word “prerequisite”.  On
    the one hand, that word can be taken to mean that the payments must be made
    as a temporal condition precedent to the registration of the Plan of Subdivision.  On
    the other hand, the term “prerequisite” can be taken to mean that the obligation
    to make the payments must be undertaken by the respondent prior to registration
    of the Plan of Subdivision.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    the word “prerequisite” is to be given a temporal meaning, then the motion
    judge’s interpretation was correct and should not be disturbed.  However,
    if the word
    “prerequisite” connotes an obligation to pay, permitting payment both before
    and after the registration of the Plan of Subdivision, then the interpretation
    advanced by the appellant must prevail.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, where there are two possible interpretations that can be given to
    the words in question, the interpretation that is consistent with the language
    of the document when read as a whole ought to prevail. In <i>Ventas, Inc.
    v. Sunrise Senior Living Real Estate Investment Trust </i>(2007), 85 O.R.
    (3d) 254, at para. 24, the Court of Appeal stated the principle as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>…a commercial contract is to be interpreted<span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:black'>,</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a)<span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana;
color:black'> </span>as a whole, in a manner that gives meaning to all of its
    terms and avoids an interpretation that would render one or more of its terms
    ineffective</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Agreement of Purchase and Sale provides in s. 6.1(b) that “[u]nless otherwise
    required under the Subdivision Agreement, the Vendor shall not be required
    to pay for its portion of such levies, capital contributions, development
    charges or imposts except within three (3) business days after it has been
    notified by the Purchaser that the Purchaser has applied for a building permit”.  If
    the temporal meaning of the word “prerequisite” is accepted then this “three
    day clause”, which permits payment after registration but prior to the issuance
    of a building permit, can have no possible meaning. Conversely, if effect
    is to be given to the “three day clause”, then the word “prerequisite” cannot
    be read temporally.  In order to give effect to s. 6.1(b) in its entirety
    without rendering one or more of its terms ineffective, I prefer the interpretation
    advanced by the appellant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> In
    my view, the motion judge erred in principle in her interpretation of the
    words
    “prerequisite to obtaining the registration”.  Read in the context of the
    agreement as a whole, they require the respondent to make the contested payments.  The
    letters in evidence before the motion judge cannot be dispositive of this
    issue.  Accordingly, I would allow the appeal, set aside the order of the
    motion judge, and issue an order declaring that the respondent is obliged
    to make the contested payments.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant will have its costs of this appeal fixed in the amount of $7,500
    inclusive of G.S.T. and disbursements.</p>
