  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was sentenced to 4 months imprisonment and 2 years probation for
    possession of cocaine for the purpose of trafficking. The evidence on the
    sentence hearing established that the appellant was distributing drugs in
    the City of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ottawa purely for commercial gain. He kept his drug supply at home, where
    he lived with his elderly mother, whom he cared for, and where his autistic
    son visited on a regular basis. Upon detection, the appellant admitted the
    offence but claimed that he was assisting a woman who was living at the home
    in an effort to wean her off her drug habit. On searching the house, the
    police found 13.2 grams of cocaine.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge refused to impose a conditional sentence, in part because he
    did not feel that it would provide the deterrent effect need to bring home
    to the appellant and others the gravity and seriousness of his crimes. In
    this regard, he noted that the appellant was a homebody who did not have
    a job or go to school and who essentially spent most of his waking hours
    at home.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    see no error in the trial judge’s approach. He did not foreclose the conditional
    sentencing regime to persons who spend most of their time at home. Instead,
    as indicated, in the particular circumstances of this case, he felt that
    something more was required to satisfy the principles of general and specific
    deterrence. At the same time, the trial judge took into account the mitigating
    circumstances relating to the appellant’s care of his mother and the special
    needs of his son. The sentence that he arrived at was, in our view, balanced
    and measured and we see no basis for interfering with it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor
    do we accept that the time spent by the appellant [11 months] on bail pending
    appeal should be taken into account as a basis for reducing the 4 month custodial
    sentence. There is nothing before us, by way of fresh evidence, to show that
    during that timeframe, the appellant took steps towards his rehabilitation
    or for that matter, that he suffered any hardship, let alone the kind of
    undue hardship, by virtue of the terms of his release, that we might be prepared
    to consider in another case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    while leave to appeal sentence is granted, the appeal is dismissed.</p>
