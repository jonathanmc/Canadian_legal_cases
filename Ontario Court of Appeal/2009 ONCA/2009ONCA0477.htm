style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    appeal concerns the informational component of the right to counsel as described
    in s. 10(b) of the <i>Charter</i>.  The parties have framed the issue in
    this way:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Is a police officer who arrests an individual at
    the roadside on an impaired driving charge required, when advising that person
    of the right to counsel, to tell the detainee that should he or she choose
    to consult counsel, that consultation will occur at the police station and
    not at the roadside?</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    the reasons that follow, I would hold that compliance with s. 10(b) does
    not necessarily require the officer to inform the detainee that should he
    or she choose to contact counsel, that contact will occur when the detainee
    is taken to the police station.</p>
  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>II.        OVERVIEW AND FACTS</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent was convicted on one count of
    “blowing over” and one count of impaired driving.  The latter charge was
    stayed.  On appeal, the summary conviction appeal court allowed the appeal
    and ordered a new trial on both counts.  The Crown seeks leave to appeal
    to this court and, if leave is granted, seeks an order restoring the conviction.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    police officer observed the respondent driving somewhat erratically.  He
    pulled her over and immediately noticed several <i>indicia</i> of impairment.  The
    police officer arrested the respondent and advised her of her right to counsel
    under s. 10(b) of the <i>Charter</i>.  I will return to the exact words he
    used later in these reasons.  The officer testified that the respondent said
    that she did not want to call a lawyer.  The police officer gave the respondent
    a secondary caution advising her of the charge and affording her the opportunity
    to make a statement.  He then made a breath demand.  The officer took the
    respondent to the local OPP detachment.  She was not given any further advice
    about her right to counsel.  Two breathalyzer tests produced readings of
    .160.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent raised only one defence at trial.  She argued that she was not
    given her right to counsel as required by s. 10(b) of the <i>Charter</i> and
    that the evidence of the breathalyzer results should be excluded pursuant
    to s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.  The trial judge rejected this argument
    finding that the officer had complied with s. 10(b) and that the respondent
    had made an informed decision not to consult with counsel.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    summary conviction appeal court judge (the
    “Appeal Judge”) took a different view of the scope of an officer’s obligation
    under s. 10(b) when informing a person detained at the roadside of his or
    her right to counsel.  The Appeal Judge concluded that the officer was required
    to advise the respondent of all legal services or information available to
    her at the police station, and to expressly advise the respondent that contact
    with counsel would be made at the police station and not at the roadside.  The
    Appeal Judge said at para. 20 of his reasons:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The informational component of section 10(b) was
    not met in the case at bar.  The appellant was also asked if she wanted to
    speak to counsel on a non-existing phone at the roadside.  <u>The appellant
    should have been told in no uncertain terms at the roadside that upon arrival
    at the police station a phone and a list of callers would have been made
    available to her if she so chose.</u>  This was not done and the police breached
    her s. 10(b) rights to call counsel before taking the breath test.  [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Appeal Judge’s reference to “a list of callers” was a reference to a list
    of lawyers’ phone numbers that may have been available at the police detachment
    to which the respondent was taken.  The evidence as to the availability of
    this list and its currency was somewhat unclear.  It is unnecessary to go
    into that evidence as counsel for the respondent, correctly in my view, does
    not contend that on this record he can argue that the police officer was
    obliged under s. 10(b) to advise the respondent that a list of lawyers’ telephone
    numbers could be made available to her at the police station.  The only issue
    before this court is whether the Appeal Judge correctly held that the police
    officer was obliged, when informing the respondent of her s. 10(b) rights,
    to tell the respondent that should she choose to speak with a lawyer, that
    consultation would take place at the police station and not at the roadside.</p>
  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>III.       SHOULD LEAVE TO APPEAL BE GRANTED?</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    court’s approach to applications for leave to appeal in summary conviction
    matters is set out in <i>R. v. R. (R.)</i> (2008), 90 O.R. (3d) 641 (C.A.).  The
    question of law raised on this application concerns the nature of the information
    a police officer must provide a detainee to comply with s. 10(b) of the <i>Charter</i> where
    the police officer arrests the detainee at the roadside and proposes to return
    him or her to the police station before providing the detainee with an opportunity
    to speak with counsel.  The legal issue goes to the proper interpretation
    of a constitutional entitlement.  The fact situation in which the issue arises
    is a very common one that will occur in hundreds of cases.  A decision by
    this court on the proper meaning of s. 10(b) in this factual context could
    impact on many other cases.  There are conflicting decisions in the lower
    courts<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for the respondent does not argue that this is an inappropriate case in which
    to grant leave to appeal.  I am satisfied that the resolution of the issue
    raised on this application is important to the administration of justice,
    and that there is sufficient merit in the Crown’s argument to warrant granting
    leave to appeal.  I would do so.</p>
  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>IV.         THE EVIDENCE RELATING TO S. 10(b)
    of the <i>CHARTER</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    arresting officer, Constable Large, testified that after he stopped the respondent,
    he quickly formed the opinion that she was impaired.  He handcuffed her and
    put her in the rear of his vehicle advising her that she was under arrest
    for impaired driving.  He decided not to search the respondent until a female
    officer arrived.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    1:14 a.m., he read the respondent her s. 10(b) rights as set out in his notebook.  The
    officer told her:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I’m arresting you for impaired driving.  <u>It is
      my duty to inform you that you have the right to retain and instruct counsel
      without delay.</u>  You have the right to telephone any lawyer you wish.  You
      also have the right to free advice from a Legal Aid lawyer.  If you are
      charged with an offence you may apply to the Ontario Legal Aid Plan for
      assistance.  1-800-265-0451 is a toll-free number that will put you in
      contact with a Legal Aid duty counsel lawyer <u>for free legal advice right

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Constable
    Large arrived back at the detachment with the respondent at 1:36 a.m., about
    20 minutes after advising her of her s. 10(b) rights.  He explained that
    since the respondent had said she did not want to consult with counsel, there
    was no further discussion about counsel once they arrived back at the station.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    cross-examination, Constable Large testified that he was aware that the respondent
    had a cell phone with her in the car.  He testified, however, that there
    was no cell phone reception at the location where he stopped the respondent.  Had
    she wanted to consult with counsel, he would have made that opportunity available
    to her when they got back to the detachment.  In his mind, making a phone
    available at the detachment would have complied with the requirements of
    s. 10(b).  He did not tell the respondent that any consultation with a lawyer
    would occur back at the police station and not at the roadside.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Constable

    he gave her and that he had to repeat it for her.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The

    to call and that she replied that she would like to call her roommate, Amanda.  The
    following exchange occurred during the respondent’s examination-in-chief:</p>

  <h2 style='line-height:200%'>V.        THE REASONS BELOW</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    his ruling, the trial judge found that Constable Large advised the respondent
    of her right to counsel, that he asked her if she wanted to contact a lawyer,
    and that the respondent told Constable Large that she did not want to consult
    with counsel.  The trial judge concluded that the officer had no obligation
    to further advise the respondent of her right to counsel once they arrived
    at the police station in light of her indication at the roadside that she
    did not wish to speak with a lawyer.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Appeal Judge did not take issue with the trial judge’s findings of fact.  Relying
    on <i>Galbraith</i>, the Appeal Judge held that Constable Large’s offer to
    permit the respondent to contact counsel “right now” was meaningless, if
    not misleading, in that the officer would not have afforded the respondent
    the opportunity to contact counsel until they arrived back at the police
    detachment.  The Appeal Judge found that in order for the respondent to make
    an informed decision as to whether to consult with counsel, it was essential
    that Constable Large tell her that the opportunity to consult with counsel
    would be afforded at the detachment and not at the roadside where she was
    advised of her right to counsel.  The Appeal Judge concluded that the information
    provided to the respondent could have misled her into believing that if she
    wanted to speak with a lawyer, she had to do so at the roadside in the police
    cruiser.</p>

    with a reasonable opportunity to do so and must refrain from further questioning
    the detainee or otherwise eliciting evidence from the detainee until he or
    she has had a reasonable opportunity to consult with counsel:  <i>R. v. Bartle</i>,
    [1994] 3 S.C.R. 173, at pp. 191-92.  This appeal involves the first of the
    requirements outlined above, commonly known as the informational component
    of s. 10(b).  As indicated above, it places the burden on the police to inform
    the detainee of the right to counsel guaranteed to the detainee by s. 10(b).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    informational component of s. 10(b) has two parts.  The first is apparent
    in the language of the section, while the second is a product of the jurisprudence.  Section
    10(b) expressly requires that the detainee be told of his or her right to
    retain and instruct counsel without delay.  In <i>R. v. Brydges</i>, [1990]
    1 S.C.R. 190, at p. 206, the Supreme Court of Canada extended the informational
    component of s. 10(b) to include the requirement that the detainee must be
    informed of the existence and availability of duty counsel and Legal Aid.  In <i>Bartle</i> at
    p. 198, the court explained that <i>Brydges</i> must be read as requiring
    the authorities to inform detainees about the availability of counsel through
    Legal Aid, and the availability of immediate free legal advice to everyone
    through duty counsel services assuming those services exist in the jurisdiction.  In
    reference to the right to access immediate free legal advice, Lamer C.J.C.
    said at p. 198:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I would add here that basic information about how
    to access available services which provide free, preliminary legal advice
    should be included in the standard s. 10(<i>b</i>) caution.  This need consist
    of no more than telling a detainee in plain language that he or she will
    be provided with a phone number should he or she wish to contact a lawyer
    right away.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    requirement that all detainees must be told of the existence and means of
    accessing duty counsel and Legal Aid gives the constitutional right to counsel
    found in s. 10(b) real meaning.  The right would be hollow for those unaware
    of how they might obtain immediate legal assistance if they were given no
    information by the authorities as to how to access legal assistance.  Nor,
    given the dynamics at play in a detention situation, should the onus be on
    the detainee to make inquiries as to how he or she might exercise the constitutional
    right to counsel.  <i>Brydges</i> and <i>Bartle</i> ensure that all detainees
    have sufficient information to make an informed decision as to whether to
    speak with counsel before submitting to police interrogation or testing.</p>

    for the respondent, in his able argument, submits that <i>Bartle</i> offers
    direct support for his contention that in addition to the information summarized
    in the immediately preceding paragraph, the respondent should have been told
    that she would be allowed to contact counsel at the police detachment and
    not at the roadside should she choose to exercise her right to counsel.  Counsel
    for the respondent relies on two passages from the reasons of the Chief Justice
    at pp. 202-203:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><u>In my opinion, the s. 10(<i>b</i>) caution that
      the appellant received, both at the roadside and at the police station,
      failed to convey the necessary sense of immediacy and universal availability
      of legal assistance.  First, when the appellant was arrested at the roadside,
      he was not told of the existence of the 1-800 number for duty counsel and
      that he would be allowed to call a lawyer as soon as he arrived at the
      police station where there were telephones.</u>  Although it was subsequently
      made clear upon arrival at the station that he could call
    “now”, the appellant had, in the intervening period between detention at
    the roadside and arrival at the station, made a self-incriminating statement.…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The 1-800 number, or at least the existence of a
    toll-free telephone number, should have been conveyed to the appellant upon
    his arrest at the roadside even though there were no telephones available.  <u>Indeed,
    the police should have explained to the appellant that, as soon as they reached
    the police station, he would be permitted to use a telephone for the purpose
    of calling a lawyer, including duty counsel which was available to give him
    immediate, free legal advice.</u>  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>These
    passages must be understood in the context of the facts of <i>Bartle</i> and
    the deficiencies in the s. 10(b) caution given by the police officer in that
    case.  In <i>Bartle</i>, the arresting officer at the roadside did not tell
    the detainee of the availability of immediate legal advice through the 24-hour
    toll-free Legal Aid number.  He also did not ask the detainee if he wished
    to call a lawyer “now”.  Nor did the officer use any other language that
    would indicate to the detainee that he could access free legal advice without
    delay.  In fact, the officer explained in his testimony that he did not ask
    the detainee if he wanted to contact a lawyer “now” because there was no
    telephone at the roadside where the officer gave the detainee his rights
    under s. 10(b).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Chief
    Justice Lamer, for the majority, concluded that the combined effect of the
    failure to tell the detainee about the availability of immediate free legal
    advice through the toll-free number and the failure to make it clear to the
    detainee that he would not have to wait a significant period of time to contact
    counsel resulted in a failure “to convey the necessary sense of immediacy
    and universal availability of legal assistance”:  p. 202.  In making his
    point, the Chief Justice noted that the detention occurred in the very early
    morning hours when the detainee, without an appropriate s. 10(b) caution,
    could reasonably think that legal advice would not be available until several
    hours later.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><i>Bartle</i> identifies
    two key components of the informational requirement embedded in s. 10(b).  First,
    the detainee must be told of the immediacy of the availability of legal assistance
    and second, the detainee must be told of the means by which he or she can
    access that legal advice.  <i>Bartle</i> holds that had the officer told
    the detainee that he could contact counsel from the police station, that
    information, combined with further information about the availability of
    immediate legal advice, would have been sufficient to convey to the detainee
    that he had a right to speak with a lawyer “without delay”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><i>Bartle</i> does
    not hold that it would have been misleading for the officer to tell the detainee
    that he could speak with counsel “now” when advising him of the right to
    counsel at the roadside.  Nor does it follow from the analysis in <i>Bartle</i> that
    the officer would have failed to comply with s. 10(b) had he told the detainee
    at the roadside that he could speak with a lawyer “now”.  The use of the
    word “now” conveys the requisite immediacy of the right to speak with a lawyer.  Used
    with the information that the detainee could get immediate free legal assistance
    on the phone, the use of the word
    “now” would also convey the nature of the s. 10(b) right and, in particular,
    the detainee’s right to speak to a lawyer “without delay”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>With
    respect to the contrary view, I do not think that the use of the word “now” in
    the context of the administration of the s. 10(b) caution at the roadside
    implies that the detainee can speak with a lawyer instantly upon the officer’s
    completion of the s. 10(b) caution.  Most police officers are not standing
    with a telephone in their outstretched hand as they complete the s. 10(b)
    caution.  The officer’s statement to a detainee at the roadside that he or
    she may speak with a lawyer “now” would necessarily convey that the right
    to speak with a lawyer was contingent on the availability of a telephone
    that was useable in circumstances that would permit the detainee to speak
    with a lawyer for the purpose of obtaining legal advice.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is important to distinguish between the nature of the rights guaranteed by
    s. 10(b) and the further question of whether the police have properly complied
    with a detainee’s right to consult with counsel in any given case.  The constitutional
    right is the right to speak with a lawyer “without delay”.  All detainees
    are entitled to that right and must be so advised by the police.  The language
    used by the police cannot suggest that the right to speak with a lawyer only
    arises at some point later on in the detention.  If the detainee, having
    been told he or she has a right to speak with a lawyer “without delay”, chooses
    to exercise that right, the police must then afford him or her a reasonable
    opportunity to do so.  Whether the steps taken by the police to make a telephone
    available to a detainee, in circumstances where he or she can speak with
    counsel, comply with the implementational requirements of s. 10(b) turns
    on the facts of the specific case and not on whether the police properly
    informed the detainee of his or her right to speak with counsel without delay.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    cases involving a roadside detention and a breathalyzer demand, all detainees
    must be told that they have the right to speak with a lawyer “without delay”.  They
    must also be told that they can access immediate free legal advice using
    the toll-free number.  Should a detainee choose to speak with counsel “without
    delay”, the police must afford him or her the opportunity to do so.  Depending
    on the circumstances, consultation with counsel “without delay” may require
    a telephone call at the roadside, at the police station where the breathalyzer
    test will be administered, or perhaps in very unusual cases, somewhere else.  It
    will all depend on the facts of the particular case.  Questions of where
    and when consultation with counsel will occur are properly considered as
    part of the implementational phase of the rights guaranteed by s. 10(b).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    are insurmountable practical problems associated with incorporating into
    the s. 10(b) caution the requirement that the officer tell the detained person
    where the communication with counsel will occur should the detained person
    choose to speak with counsel.  Police officers, when advising a detained
    person of his or her right to counsel under s. 10(b), will often not know
    all of the facts that may be relevant to where and when access to counsel
    must be provided to comply with the implementational component of s. 10(b)
    should the detainee elect to consult with counsel.  For example, the arresting
    officer may believe that the consultation with counsel must occur at the
    police station because the arresting officer does not know that the detainee
    has a cell phone that works in the location where the arrest occurs.  In
    that case, an indication to the detainee that any contact with counsel must
    be made at the station might well misinform the detainee as to the nature
    of his or her s. 10(b) rights should the detainee elect to contact counsel.  It
    may be that the implementational requirements of s. 10(b) would require that
    the detainee be allowed to make the call from the roadside.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    practical difficulties that would be created by requiring arresting officers
    to tell detainees where and when they can exercise their s. 10(b) rights
    as part of the informational component of s. 10(b) is not limited to the
    roadside arrest/breathalyzer demand situation.  In most arrest situations,
    the arresting officer will not be in a position to hand the detained person
    a telephone immediately upon completing the s. 10(b) caution.  In these situations,
    there will inevitably be some time gap in time and place between the detained
    person’s assertion of his or her wish to speak with counsel and the availability
    of the means of effecting that communication with counsel.  If the reasoning
    of the Appeal Judge is correct, an arresting officer, unless he or she has
    the phone immediately at hand, will mislead the detainee if the officer tells
    the detainee that he or she may speak with counsel “now”.  On the approach
    of the Appeal Judge, the arresting officer must, in the heat of the arresting
    moment, make an assessment, often a very uninformed one, of where and when
    the detainee would be allowed to speak with counsel should he or she elect
    to do so.  The Appeal Judge would require that this information, often misleading,
    be incorporated into the s. 10(b) caution.  Imposing this kind of requirement
    on an arresting officer is not only impractical, but undermines the need
    to make it clear to all detained persons that they have the right to speak
    with a lawyer “without delay”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    am also not moved by the contention that the use of the word “now” in advising
    a detainee of his or her right to counsel may be misleading to some detainees
    in some situations.  Virtually any word in the English language has some
    ambiguity and is capable of taking on different meanings to different people.  Any
    word or combination of words has the potential to mislead somebody at some
    time.  For example, had the officer used the language required by the Appeal
    Judge, a detainee might well have believed that he or she could contact their
    lawyer at the police station, but only after the breathalyzer was administered.  That
    detainee would have been misled by the language that the Appeal Judge would
    require the police to use.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is fruitless to search for phrasing that does not have any potential to mislead
    anybody in any given situation.  Rather than pursuing the hopeless task of
    finding absolutely unambiguous language, compliance with s. 10(b) must be
    measured by its ability to convey the essential character of the s. 10(b)
    rights to the detainee – the right to immediate access to a lawyer, including
    access through the toll-free number to immediate free legal advice.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    is value in the use of a standardized s. 10(b) caution which complies with
    the informational requirements established in the Supreme Court of Canada
    jurisprudence.  Attempts to graft onto the standardized caution fact-specific
    information as to where and when the detainee can exercise the right to counsel,
    if he or she chooses to do so, is more calculated to create litigation than
    to advance the purposes of the constitutional right protected by s. 10(b).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I,
    of course, do not suggest that the police are never obligated to go beyond
    the information required to comply with the informational component of s.
    10(b).  Questions or comments made by a detainee or other circumstances at
    the time the s. 10(b) caution is given may indicate a misunderstanding by
    the detainee of the nature of the s. 10(b) rights.  In those circumstances,
    the arresting officer will have to provide a further explanation of the rights:  <i>R.
    v. Kennedy</i> (1995), 103 C.C.C. (3d) 161 (Nfld.
    <st1:place w:st="on">

    2 S.C.R. 537, at p. 540; and <i>Leedahl</i> at paras. 13-14.  It is noteworthy
    that <i>Galbraith</i>, the case relied on by the Appeal Judge, and the other
    trial decisions to the same effect (<i>Dean</i> and <i>C.J.S.</i>), were
    cases in which the court found, based on the circumstances in which the s.
    10(b) caution was given and the responses of the detainees, that the detainees
    did not understand the nature of their s. 10(b) rights.  Consequently, the
    results in these cases can be justified without requiring the arresting officer
    to go beyond the informational component of s. 10(b) as set down in <i>Brydges</i> and <i>Bartle</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

    her testimony, the respondent did not suggest that she did not understand
    what she was told about the right to counsel or that she was misled into
    believing that her only choice was to contact counsel from the back of the
    police cruiser at the roadside.  The respondent testified that she did not
    hear the officer say anything about her right to speak with a lawyer and
    that had she been aware of that right, she would have asked to speak with
    a lawyer.  The trial judge rejected her evidence.  He accepted Constable
    Large’s testimony that the respondent was invited to consult with counsel “now” and
    unequivocally declined that opportunity.  The Appeal Judge found that the
    officer’s language misled the respondent into thinking that she could only
    contact counsel immediately from the roadside.  There is nothing in the evidence
    to support this finding which runs contrary to the finding of the trial judge
    and the appellant’s own evidence.  The Appeal Judge was not entitled to substitute
    his factual finding for that of the trial judge.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    the reasons I have tried to explain, there is nothing inherently misleading
    in telling a detainee at the roadside that he or she can speak with a lawyer “now”.  In
    my view, that phraseology conveys the immediacy of the detainee’s entitlement
    to speak with a lawyer.  The further question of what the police must do
    to make good on that offer arises if and when the detainee chooses to exercise
    the right to speak with a lawyer “without delay”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    language used by Constable Large conveyed to the respondent that she could
    speak with a lawyer without delay if she wanted to do so.  Combined with
    the information he gave her concerning how she could access counsel immediately
    through the toll-free number, the respondent was armed with all the information
    she needed to make an informed decision as to whether she wanted to speak
    with a lawyer before submitting to the breathalyzer demand.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

    would add one further comment with respect to Constable Large’s failure to
    re-advise the respondent of her right to counsel when he and the respondent
    arrived at the detachment.  I agree with the holding in <i>Leedahl</i> in
    this regard.  Where a detainee has been properly cautioned at the roadside
    and has indicated that he or she does not wish to speak with a lawyer, failure
    to re-advise the detainee of his or her right to counsel at the police station
    does not necessarily constitute a breach of s. 10(b).  That said, however,
    I think that in cases such as this, it would be a much better practice for
    the police, upon arrival at the detachment, to reiterate the right to counsel.  A
    simple repetition of the right to counsel and an invitation to a detainee
    to speak with counsel “now”, if he or she wishes to do so, would serve two
    purposes.  First, it would reinforce the fundamental importance of the right
    to counsel and the need for all participants in the justice system to recognize
    that fundamental importance.  Second, it would effectively short-circuit
    any claim at trial by a detainee that he or she was misled at the roadside
    by the use of the universal s. 10(b) caution into believing that the right
    to counsel could only be exercised then and there.  Given the right circumstances,
    and absent a reiteration of the right to counsel at the police station, that
    argument could succeed.</p>

    for the respondent argued that if the court accepted the Crown’s position
    on the s. 10(b) issue, the Appeal Judge’s order for a new trial could be
    sustained on another ground.  Counsel argued before the Appeal Judge that
    the interventions of the trial judge were such as to render the appearance
    of the trial unfair and to necessitate a new trial.  The Appeal Judge did
    not address this issue given his finding on the s. 10(b) issue.  Counsel

    the cross-examination of Constable Large, were helpful to an understanding
    of the evidence.  The worst that could be said is that some of the interventions
    were unnecessary.  None suggest any prejudgment, bias against the respondent,

    court was referred to three cases going each way on this issue:  <i>R. v.
    Galbraith</i> (2005), 129 C.R.R. (2d) 169 (S.C.); <i>R. v. Dean</i>, 2008
    ONCJ 702; and <i>R. v. C.J.S.</i>, [2006] O.J. No. 2117 (Ct. J.), favour
    the position taken by the Appeal Judge.  <i>R. v. Sihanath</i>, 2007 ONCJ
    665; <i>R. v. Woldegzi</i> (2006), 39 M.V.R. (5th) 256 (Ont. Ct. J.); and <i>R.
    v. Phonprasith</i>, [2006] O.J. No. 5293 (Ct. J.), favour the position advanced
    by the Crown on this appeal.</p>

      v. Leedahl</i> (2002), 24 M.V.R. (4th) 188 (Sask. C.A.), involves a fact
      situation which is virtually identical to this case.  The issue raised,
      however, turned on whether s. 10(b) of the <i>Charter</i> required that
      a person who had been given his rights to counsel at the roadside and declined
      to exercise those rights must also be advised of his right to counsel upon
      arrival at the police station and prior to the administration of the breathalyzer.  The
      court unanimously held that in the absence of any basis for finding that
      the accused did not understand his rights when advised of them at the roadside,
      there was no obligation to further advise an accused of his right to counsel
      upon arrival at the station.</p>
