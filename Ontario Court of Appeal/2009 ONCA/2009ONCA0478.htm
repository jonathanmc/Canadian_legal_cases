  <h2>I.          OVERVIEW</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant was convicted of criminal negligence causing bodily harm and aggravated
    assault against her husband by having unprotected sexual intercourse with
    him while she knew she had tested positive for the Human Immunodeficiency
    Virus (HIV).  The trial judge sentenced her to two years imprisonment in
    addition to one year of credit for strict pre-trial bail conditions. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    was undisputed at trial that the appellant gave her husband HIV through repeated
    unprotected sex.  Further, there was no dispute that, if she knew she was
    then HIV-positive, her conduct constituted the offences charged.  The sole
    issue at trial was whether the appellant knew she had HIV when repeatedly
    having unprotected sex with her husband.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant claimed that she thought a Canadian immigration medical assessment
    found her HIV-negative, some time after she received an HIV-positive result
    in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Hong Kong.  <span style='line-height:200%'>She testified that she was skeptical
    of the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Hong Kong test because she did not trust the laboratory at which she had
    been tested.  She claimed to trust the negative result of what she believed
    was an HIV test conducted in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    as part of the immigration process.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge disbelieved the appellant and found that she was aware of her
    HIV-positive status during her marriage with the complainant.  He found that
    she would have taken further steps to confirm that she was HIV-negative had
    she actually believed that she had received conflicting results on two tests.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>The
      appellant appeals both her conviction and sentence.</span></p>
  <h2>II.        FACTS</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Most
    of the facts at trial were undisputed, except whether the appellant knew
    she was HIV-positive while regularly having unprotected sex with the complainant,
    and how fluent she was in the English language.  The following, however,
    were either undisputed or uncontradicted. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Around
    1995, the appellant, originally from
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Thailand</st1:country-region>
    , worked in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Hong Kong for a month as a prostitute.  In the same year, she had an HIV
    test at a clinic in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Hong Kong.  She was told she tested positive.  She testified that although
    she doubted the reliability of this result, she stopped having sex after
    receiving it, knowing the communicability of HIV.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Two
    weeks after her HIV-positive test, the appellant entered
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    on a work permit to work at the Zanzibar Tavern in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Toronto as a dancer.  <span style='line-height:200%'>Some time after arriving,
    the appellant had a Canadian immigration medical assessment for her work
    permit renewal.  This examination included the taking of blood samples.  The
    appellant testified that she believed she was being tested for HIV as part
    of this examination.  There is no evidence that the assessment included an
    HIV test, that anyone told her it included an HIV test, or that she asked
    anyone whether it included an HIV test.  She testified that her boss, Wally,
    told her that everything was okay
    as a result of that assessment.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    complainant was a regular customer at the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Zanzibar and met the appellant there in 1996.  They began to date, and after
    one and a half to two months started a sexual relationship.  During this
    period they had intercourse two to three times per week.  They generally
    used condoms, purchased by the complainant.  In the summer of 1997, they
    married and moved in together.  After their wedding, they stopped using condoms
    altogether.  The couple spoke occasionally about sexually transmitted diseases,
    and the appellant told the complainant that she was tested whenever she renewed
    her work permit and that she did not have HIV or any other sexually transmitted
    disease.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant and complainant separated twice, first in 1999 for about a year,
    and again in 2002, for about nine months.  There were conflicts in the marriage;
    however, both testified that they genuinely loved each other and that their
    relationship was close.  The appellant continued to work at the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Zanzibar on renewed work permits until she became a permanent resident of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    on April 30, 2001. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    February 2004, the appellant was admitted to hospital in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto.  She was diagnosed with cryptococcal meningitis, an AIDS-defining
    illness. Only when testing in March 2004 showed she had AIDS did she tell
    the complainant that she had HIV or AIDS.  The complainant subsequently was
    tested for HIV and tested positive. The defence conceded that he received
    HIV from the appellant.</p>
  <h2>III.       ISSUES</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant raises four grounds of appeal against her conviction, which are
    essentially that the trial judge erred in the following ways.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    the appellant submits that the trial judge erred in rejecting the testimony
    of the appellant insofar as he failed to consider the appellants background
    and lack of sophistication in evaluating the credibility of her evidence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    the appellant submits that the trial judge failed to consider the exculpatory
    effect of the fact that she had conscientiously refrained from sexual activity
    after testing HIV-positive in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    Hong Kong, in order to avoid transmitting the disease, and resumed sexual
    activity only after the Canadian medical examination.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third,
    the appellant submits that the trial judge erred in finding that the appellants
    right to a trial within a reasonable time under s. 11(b) of the <i>Canadian
    Charter of Rights and Freedoms </i>was not violated.  She says the charges
    should have been stayed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>  Fourth,
    the appellant submits that the trial judge totally misapprehended her evidence
    in two respects: (i) her belief in connection with the medical tests in Hong
    Kong and
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    ; and (ii) what she told her husband about those tests. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    the appellant also seeks leave to appeal her sentence, asking that it be
    reduced by one day so as to retain her entitlement to appeal a potential
    deportation order. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    did not call on the Crown to respond to the appellants submissions regarding:
    (i) the trial judges failure to consider the appellants background and
    lack of sophistication; (ii) his failure to consider her conduct after she
    tested HIV-positive in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Hong Kong; and (iii) the s. 11(b) <i>Charter</i> issue.  In the end, I conclude
    that the appellants conviction appeal must be dismissed.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>I
      would, however, grant leave to appeal sentence and for the reasons that
      follow, allow the sentence appeal.  I would set aside the sentence of two
      years imprisonment and impose a sentence of two years less one day.</span></p>
  <h2>IV.       ANALYSIS</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    will proceed by first briefly addressing the issues that were not the subject
    of any response from the Crown, and thereafter deal with the remaining grounds
    of appeal, including the appellants assertion that the trial judge engaged
    in circular reasoning, followed by the sentence appeal.</p>
  <h2>(i)        The appellants background and lack of sophistication</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant was thirty-seven years old at the time of trial.  She was born
    in a small village in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Thailand</st1:country-region>
    , left school at age ten or eleven, and contends that she has limited literacy
    in her own language and none in English.  The appellant argues that the trial
    judge misunderstood the defence position regarding her background and lack
    of sophistication.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge erroneously took the view that the
    defence at trial conceded that the appellants background and lack of sophistication
    were irrelevant to whether or not her evidence was credible.  Rather, she
    says her background was very relevant, particularly in determining whether
    she was telling the truth about her reaction to the Canadian test and her
    belief that when her boss told her that her tests came back okay, that
    meant that she was HIV-negative.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    do not read the trial judges reasons in this way.  In my view, he decided
    that in light of all the evidence, the appellants background was not particularly
    relevant to the issue of her credibility.  His view was confirmed by the
    defence argument at trial, which did not explicitly raise the issue of the
    appellants background.  The appellants counsel candidly noted that he could
    not point to any passage in defence counsels trial submissions focusing
    on her background as a factor to be considered in evaluating her credibility,
    but contented himself with saying that the defence had called this evidence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    would reject this argument.  In my view, the trial judge made no error and
    simply attached the weight to the evidence about the appellants background
    that he thought it deserved. </p>
  <h2>(ii)      The appellants conduct after testing HIV-positive</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants argument here is that the trial judge did not consider certain
    circumstantial factors that support her credibility.  I would dismiss this
    ground of appeal.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant offers as a stark example of such circumstantial factors, her uncontradicted
    testimony that she stopped having sex after the positive HIV test in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Hong Kong.  Further, she testified that she only resumed sex once she believed
    that she had tested negative in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  The appellant submits that the trial judge never addressed whether this
    responsible conduct enhanced her credibility on the issue that she believed
    she was HIV-negative after the Canadian medical tests.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

    after the Canadian test.  The defence at trial conceded that this was the
    only issue.  That is, if the trial judge disbelieved the appellant and found

    had to be found guilty of both charges.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

      specific reasons given by the trial judge as to why he disbelieved the
      appellant are as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>After careful consideration of all of the evidence,
    I reject Ms. Iamkhongs testimony that she believed that she was HIV-negative.  Nor
    does that evidence leave me with a reasonable doubt about whether or not
    she believed she was HIV-negative.  I have come to this conclusion based
    on the following considerations:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>1.         The story simply does not correspond
    with common sense.  Given that Ms. Iamkhong understood the gravity of the
    first positive result for HIV, one would expect her to seek out a second
    test as soon as she arrived in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  This seems even clearer when one considers that Ms. Iamkhong seems to
    have had doubts about the reliability of the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    Hong Kong clinic and its testing.  Certainly Ms. Iamkhong should have sought
    a second HIV test once she decided to resume sexual activity.  Not only<i> </i>did
    she<i> </i>not attempt to have any such test while in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    , it appears from both her testimony and the contents of the medical records
    filed as exhibits that Ms. Iamkhong never told any medical personnel about
    a previous positive test until she succumbed to Cryptococcus.  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>2.         I also reject Ms. Iamkhongs assertion
    that she genuinely thought the medical test required by Immigration Canada
    would necessarily determine her HIV status.  There is no evidence that HIV
    testing was even mentioned by anyone 
    certainly [the appellant] made no mention of this.  There is no doubt that
    she understood she had previously tested positive for HIV and that she understood
    the serious consequences of such a diagnosis.  One would expect that if Ms.
    Iamkhong was truly concerned about her HIV status, she would have sought
    to clarify this, even though she attended the medical examination for Immigration
    Canada without an interpreter.  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>3.         Even if Ms. Iamkhong thought the second
    test indicated that she was HIV-negative, given that she understood the gravity
    of the situation, one would expect that she would make some greater effort
    to clarify the conflicting results rather than merely relying on the woefully
    incomplete second-hand account provided by Wally, her employer.  Indeed,
    having received inconsistent results, one positive and one negative, I would
    have expected her to seek further clarification rather than merely relying
    on the most recent test.  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>4.         <span style='color:black'>That Ms. Iamkhong
      never made any effort to clarify her HIV status is supported by the medical
      notes relating to her contacts with other doctors.  While I am aware these
      records are not recorded statements from Ms. Iamkhong, I note there is
      no mention on any of them that she was HIV-positive.  This is particularly
      striking in that she did not even mention the HIV-positive test result
      when she went to see the doctor because of a concern that she had contracted
      a sexually transmitted disease.  In such a circumstance, one would expect
      that Ms. Iamkhong would at least mention she had previously had a positive
      HIV result but was later cleared by the Immigration Canada medical examination.  I
      do not accept, as Mr. Berg suggests, that this failure to mention the positive
      test is because Ms. Iamkhong believed she was not really HIV-positive.  Rather,
      having considered all of the evidence, I find this is because Ms. Iamkhong
      consciously withheld this information from the medical professionals she
      dealt with. </span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='color:black'>5.         </span>I am also troubled by the fact that Ms.
    Iamkhong never told [her husband] about the positive test in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Hong Kong and her belief that she was subsequently cleared by the second
    test.  Mr. Berg did concede that Ms. Iamkhong did, on several occasions,
    discuss issues of condom use, sexually transmitted diseases and HIV status
    with [her husband].  Even if Ms. Iamkhong did not, for whatever reason, want
    to mention the initial positive test in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Hong Kong, one would expect that she would have told [her husband] that the
    Immigration Canada medical examination was proof that she was HIV-negative.  But
    Ms. Iamkhong made no mention of the latter test, the very one that she says
    is the basis for her belief that she posed no risk to [her husband].</p>

    appellant argues that the trial judges five reasons for rejecting her testimony
    demonstrate two significant errors.  First, his reasons are all grounded
    on a basic misapprehension of the appellants evidence.  She contends that
    the trial judges reasons are founded on his expectation about how a person
    would behave if she had received conflicting results in consecutive HIV tests
    and was therefore uncertain about her HIV status.  Because the appellants
    actions were inconsistent with these expectations, he disbelieved her when
    she claimed to believe she was HIV-negative.    </p>

    appellant argues that she did not testify that she was uncertain,<i> </i>or
    in a state of doubt, about her HIV status after the Canadian test.  Rather,
    she testified that she did not trust the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Hong Kong result and she believed the Canadian test had proven her to be
    HIV-negative.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

    appellant submits that the five reasons set out by the trial judge, in effect,
    show that her actions were inconsistent with someone left in doubt about
    her HIV status by conflicting tests.  However, the appellant contends, this
    was not a state of mind she claimed to have held at the relevant time.  The
    trial judge, therefore, wrongly started from the assumption that the appellant
    would have been left in doubt by what she believed was the second HIV test,
    and assessed her conduct accordingly.  Such an approach, she says, fails
    to take account of the appellants situation, and presumes a rejection of
    her testimony that she believed herself to be HIV-negative.   </p>

    second error is said to rest on a major misapprehension of the evidence by
    the trial judge.  Specifically, in the trial judges fifth reason, he relies
    on the fact that the appellant never told her husband about the positive
    test in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Hong Kong, and on the appellants belief that she was subsequently cleared
    by the second test.  The husband, in fact, testified that the appellant did
    tell him she had tested negative on the immigration medical examination in

    to the first ground, the trial judge was clearly aware that the appellants
    position was that she did not believe she was HIV-positive.  Indeed, he prefaces
    his list of five specific reasons for rejecting her testimony with a clear
    reference to this belief:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>After careful consideration of all of the evidence,
    I reject Ms. Iamkhongs testimony that she believed that she was HIV-negative.  Nor

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Further
    on, in reason four, he states:  I do not accept, as Mr. Berg suggests, that
    this failure to mention the positive test is because Ms. Iamkhong believed
    she was not really HIV-positive.  His reasons must, therefore, be read in
    this context.  </p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Once
    again, the trial judges reasons focus almost entirely on whether the appellant
    believed that she was HIV-negative.  The reasons address her state of mind
    after both HIV tests, including the one she assumed Canadian immigration
    officials performed, and the trial judge acknowledged her testimony that
    she thought she was HIV-negative. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span

    trial judge was not foreclosed from considering whether the appellants alleged
    belief was believable simply because she said that she had no doubt from
    the two tests.  I cannot find any basis upon which to conclude that the trial
    judge misapprehended her evidence about her belief.</p>

      question to be decided here is whether the appellant has demonstrated that
      the trial judges misapprehension of the evidence that she told her husband
      about the supposed negative Canada immigration HIV test is a material part
      of the evidence at trial, and whether this error played an essential part
      in the trial judges reasoning process leading to a conviction, such that
      it constituted a miscarriage of justice pursuant to s. 686(1)(a)(iii) of
      the <i>Criminal Code</i>: <i>R. v. Morrissey</i> (1995), 22 O.R. (3d) 514

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Where a trial judge is mistaken as to the substance

    in the reasoning process resulting in a conviction then, in my view, the
    accuseds conviction is not based exclusively on the evidence and is not
    a true verdict.
    If an appellant can demonstrate that the conviction depends on a misappre-hension
    of the evidence then, in my view, it must follow that the appellant has not
    received a fair trial, and was the victim of a miscarriage of justice.  This
    is so even if the evidence, as actually adduced at trial, was capable of
    supporting a conviction.</p>

    as follows, at para. 2:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><i>Morrissey</i>, it should be emphasized, describes
    a stringent standard. The misapprehension of the evidence must go to the
    substance rather than to the detail.  It must be material rather than peripheral
    to the reasoning of the trial judge.  Once those hurdles are surmounted,
    there is the further hurdle (the test is expressed as conjunctive rather
    than disjunctive) that the errors thus identified must play an essential
    part not just in the narrative of the judgment but &quot;in the reasoning
    process resulting in a conviction&quot;.</p>

    counsel offers a different approach to the application of the test in <i>Morrissey</i> to
    this case.   The Crown says that the correct approach is to require the appellant
    to show that the result <i>would</i> have been different had the mistake
    not been made.  The appellant, on the other hand, asserts that all she need
    show is that the result <i>could</i> have been different.</p>

    p. 541: </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:normal;'>
    any error, including one involving a misapprehension of the evidence by the
      trial judge must be assessed by reference to its impact on the fairness

      this court held in <i>R. v. Hamilton</i> (2004), 72 O.R. (3d) 1, at para.
      85:  </span><span style='color:black'>T</span>here is seldom only one

      seems to me to be such a case.  </span>As was the case in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <i>Hamilton</i>, the appellants conviction makes her inadmissible under
    the <i>Immigration and Refugee Protection Act</i>, and could trigger steps
    resulting in her deportation.  If the appellant receives a sentence of more
    than two years and is ordered deported, one of the avenues by which she could
    challenge that deportation would be lost by virtue of the length of the sentence
    imposed:  <i>Immigration and Refugee Protection Act</i>, s. 64(2).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

color:black'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    risk of deportation is a factor that can be considered in deciding the appropriate
    sentencing responses and tailoring the sentence to best fit the crime and
    the offender:
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    <i>Hamilton</i>, at para. 156<i>.</i>  I believe, as was the case in <i>Hamilton</i>,
    that the trial judge, in deciding that a sentence at or near two years was
    the appropriate sentence, would have been entitled to look at the deportation
    consequences for the appellant of imposing a sentence of two years less a
    day as opposed to a sentence of two years.  And, as in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <i>Hamilton</i>, had he done so, this would have been an example of the human
    face of the sentencing process:
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <i>Hamilton</i>, at para. 158. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    sentence of two years less a day after credit for strict bail conditions
    would be equally fit, but would entitle the appellant to seek to remain in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    , subject to appropriate conditions.  Insofar as the impact of the sentence
    on the appellant is concerned, this is a serious consideration.
     </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;
color:black'>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    appears that the future prospects of the appellant can be assisted or improved
    by imposing a sentence of two years less a day, rather than two years.  In
    such a situation, it is entirely in keeping with the principles and objectives
    of sentencing to impose the shorter sentence:
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    <i>Hamilton</i>, at para. 158.   And, as Doherty J.A. also noted in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <i>Hamilton</i> at para. 158, [w]hile the assistance afforded to someone
    like [the appellant] by the imposition of a sentence of two years less a
    day rather than two years may be relatively small, there is no countervailing
    negative impact on broader societal interests occasioned by the imposition
    of that sentence.  </p>

      these reasons, I would grant leave to appeal sentence and I would allow
      the sentence appeal.  I would set aside the sentence of two years imprisonment
      imposed at trial and substitute a sentence of two years less one day.</span></p>

    I would grant the appellant leave to appeal the sentence imposed at trial;
    I would allow that appeal and set aside the two year sentence and substitute
