  <h3>I.          OVERVIEW </h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defendant at trial, Aviva Insurance Company of
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    (“Aviva”), appeals from the judgment of the trial judge dated October 28,
    2008, following the delivery of reasons for judgment dated June 21, 2007.  Following
    a four-day trial, the trial judge concluded that the respondent, who was
    injured in an automobile accident on March 27, 2001, was completely unable
    to engage in any employment for which he was
    “reasonably suited by education, training or experience” under s. 5(2)(b)
    of the <i>Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule –
    Accidents on or after November 1</i>, <i>1996</i>, O. Reg. 403/96 (the “Schedule”)
    of the <i>Insurance Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. I.8.  Accordingly, the trial
    judge held that the respondent was entitled to receive a continuing income
    replacement benefit under s. 4 of the Schedule.  The appellant appeals the
    trial judge’s finding that the appellant satisfied the test under s. 5(2)(b)
    of the Schedule for entitlement to a continuing income replacement benefit
    under s. 4 of the Schedule.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would allow the appeal because the trial judge applied the wrong test in
    concluding that the respondent was completely unable to engage in any employment
    for which he was “reasonably suited by education, training or experience” under
    s. 5(2)(b) of the Schedule and therefore entitled to a continuing income
    replacement benefit under s. 4 of the Schedule.  On the findings made by
    the trial judge, the application of the correct test leads to the conclusion
    that the respondent is not entitled to a continuing income replacement benefit.</p>
  <h3>II.        RELEVANT BACKGROUND AND FACTS</h3>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The respondent’s accident and claims for an income replacement
      benefit</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant insured the respondent under a standard
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario policy of automobile insurance.  The respondent was injured on his
    way to work in an automobile accident on March 27, 2001.  At the time of
    the accident, the respondent was 29 years old and was employed as a general
    labourer.  His employment position required some heavy lifting, the ability
    to drive a vehicle, and the ability to receive instructions and to communicate
    with the employer’s representatives and others.  In the year before his accident,
    the respondent earned approximately $25,000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    the accident, the respondent was unable to pick up heavy objects and was
    therefore unable to perform his job.  He underwent an assessment at a
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Disability
    <st1:PlaceName

    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Center (the “First DAC Assessment”), which concluded that he was unable to
    meet all of the physical demands of his pre-accident employment.  He applied
    for and received from the appellant an income replacement benefit in the
    amount of $400 per week under s. 4 of the Schedule since he was suffering “a
    substantial inability to perform the essential tasks of [his] employment”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    4(1) of the Schedule provides for an employee’s entitlement to an income
    replacement benefit:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='text-align:justify;'>4(1) The insurer shall pay an insured
    person who sustains an impairment as a result of an accident an income replacement
    benefit if the insured person meets any of the following qualifications:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='text-align:justify;'>1. The insured person was
    employed at the time of the accident and, as a result of and within 104 weeks
    after the accident, <i>suffers a substantial inability to perform the essential
    tasks of that employment</i>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    5(2)(b), however, limits an insured’s entitlement to an income replacement
    benefit under the s. 4 test to 104 weeks.  After 104 weeks, the insured must
    satisfy the stricter standard under s. 5(2)(b).  Sections 5(1) and 5(2)(b)
    confirm this stricter standard:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>5(1) Subject to subsection (2), an income replacement
    benefit is payable during the period that the insured person suffers a substantial
    inability to perform the essential tasks of the employment in respect of
    which he or she qualifies for the benefit under section 4.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2) The insurer is not required to pay an income
    replacement benefit,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b) for any period longer than 104 weeks of disability,
    unless, as a result of the accident, the insured person is <i>suffering a
    complete inability to engage in any employment for which he or she is reasonably
    suited by education, training or experience</i>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    March 27, 2003, after 104 weeks of paying the respondent an income replacement
    benefit, the appellant took the position that the respondent did not meet
    the stricter s. 5(2)(b) standard and terminated his income replacement benefit.  The
    respondent disagreed with the appellant’s decision and agreed to undergo
    a second assessment at a
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Disability
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Assessment
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Center (the “Post-104 DAC”).  The Post-104 DAC concluded, in effect, that
    the respondent did not suffer a complete inability to engage in any employment
    for which he was reasonably suited by education, training, or experience.  Consequently,
    on July 24, 2003, the appellant confirmed its decision to terminate the respondent’s
    income replacement benefit effective August 11, 2003. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>The commencement of the action</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    mediation permitted by s. 280(1) of the <i>Insurance Act</i><a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a> through the Financial Services Commission of Ontario
    (the “FSCO”) was unsuccessful, the respondent chose to commence an action
    rather than referring the issues in dispute to an arbitrator. That choice
    was available to him under s.  281 of the <i>Insurance Act</i>.  In his brief
    Statement of Claim dated January 14, 2004, the respondent stated that: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[H]e was completely unable to engage in any occupation
    within his education, training and experience.  The Plaintiff did not complete
    Grade 11 in high school.  His entire working experience before the accident
    was in heavy to very heavy labour occupations.  His back and shoulder injuries
    completely prevent him from returning to his occupation at the time of the
    accident or any similar occupation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sole issue raised by the respondent in his Statement of Claim was his entitlement
    to an income replacement benefit in the amount of $400 from August 11, 2003
    to the date of trial.  In his reasons for judgment, the trial judge stated
    that both parties had framed the issue as follows: “Is Wade Burtch completely
    unable to perform the duties of any occupation for which he is suitable by
    virtue of education, experience and training?”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Extensive
    medical and vocational rehabilitation evidence was filed at trial.  The trial
    judge noted that the committee that administered the First DAC Assessment
    had the opinions of two orthopaedic surgeons who had examined the respondent
    and had observed surveillance videos of him.  These surgeons concluded that
    there was no objective evidence of musculoskeletal factors that would preclude
    the respondent from returning to his pre-injury employment.  The committee
    was nonetheless satisfied that the respondent suffered a substantial inability
    to perform the essential tasks of his employment because of the psychometric
    findings, which suggested “a cognitive impairment which may, in turn, be
    related to clinical depression and/or subtle brain injury”.  The videotaped
    evidence did not affect the psychometric findings.  The committee concluded
    that the respondent satisfied the s. 5(1) standard for entitlement to an
    initial income replacement benefit for the first 104 days of disability.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Post-104 DAC considered medical evidence, a vocational assessment, and the
    report of an occupational therapist.  The Post-104 DAC committee indicated
    that the accident did not impair the respondent’s memory, and that his cognitive
    impairment with respect to arithmetic pre-existed the accident.  Further,
    the respondent did not exhibit the signs of post-traumatic stress disorder.  The
    report concluded that, with adequate physical conditioning the respondent
    might be capable of returning to a job involving light to medium physical
    exertion provided that his shoulder was not elevated and he did not engage
    in repetitive tasks. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    its report, the Post-104 DAC committee made the following three recommendations:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
    of Mr. Burtch’s intellectual limitation and poor academics, he should be
    provided with adequate vocational assistance to secure alternate employment.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
    Mr. Burtch has not engaged in any job for the last two years, he is physically
    de-conditioned. Therefore, he should be provided with an active physical-conditioning
    program.  In the words of Dr. Faris, “if he were to engage in assertive muscle
    heating and stretching, strengthening routine, along with aerobic conditioning,
    he could well return to this capacity (i.e. his previous employment) in a
    period of three to six months.”</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Burtch is convinced in the belief that the accident has resulted in neurocognitive
    deficits though objective evidence does not support his contention.  A brief
    period of counselling will hopefully reassure him to allay his concerns. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    the Post-104 DAC report, R.J. Skirda and Associates was contracted to provide
    vocational counselling support to the respondent in order to assist him in
    the process of re-integrating into competitive employment.  Melissa Skirda,
    B.A. (Hons.), RRP Vocational Counsellor, authored their report dated December
    9, 2003.  She had access to the Post-104 DAC assessment report and considered
    some of the vocations it identified as potential employment alternatives
    for the respondent.  She concluded that the respondent’s “greatest potential
    for future employment” was in the field of long haul truck driving.  In order
    to qualify for such employment, however, the respondent needed to complete
    a truck-driving training course at a cost of about $4,250 and to obtain an
    i94 waiver card to enable him to cross the border.  The respondent testified
    that he was prepared to give long haul trucking a try. </p>
  <h3>III.       THE TRIAL JUDGE’S FINDINGS, ANALYSIS, AND REASONS</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    a comprehensive review of the evidence and a number of reported decisions
    of arbitrators of the Ontario Insurance Commission and the FSCO<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a>, the trial judge posed the questions he had to
    answer as follows:  “[D]oes the plaintiff exhibit residual effects from injuries
    suffered in the accident, and, is there any job for the plaintiff, not a
    notional job but an actual job for which the plaintiff qualifies, paying
    similar remuneration as the plaintiff's past employment, without the need
    for substantial retraining?”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    answering these questions, the trial judge adopted a number of key principles
    from the decisions of the arbitrators.  First, a suitable alternative occupation
    must be reasonably comparable to the insured’s former job both in status
    and reward.  Second, a job cannot be considered a suitable alternative if
    a substantial amount of upgrading is required.  Finally, while the primary
    focus in determining whether a job is a suitable alternative is on the insured’s
    functional limitations, job market considerations are also relevant.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that the respondent suffered impairment, and that his impairment
    was a result of the car accident.  The respondent’s restriction to light
    to medium exertion was a physical restriction, particularly given his employment
    experience and training.  He suffered from headaches after the accident.  Finally,
    his personality had changed significantly for the worse since the accident;
    he experienced frustration, a lack of impulse control, short-term memory
    problems, forgetfulness, and an inability to multi-task.  The trial judge
    found that these personality traits limited the respondent’s employment possibilities.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    made these findings, the trial judge then turned to the main issue at trial,
    namely, whether the respondent was completely unable to perform the duties
    of any occupation for which he was suitable by virtue of education, experience,
    and training within the meaning of s. 5(2)(b) of the Schedule, and therefore
    entitled to a continuing income replacement benefit under s. 4.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge noted that while the respondent did not identify prior to trial
    an alternate job for which he was reasonably suited but which his impairment
    prevented him from performing, he did testify that he was willing to try
    long haul trucking.  According to the rehabilitation and vocational counsellors,
    this was the only job for which the respondent qualified.  It was the only
    job generated by the computer search which “made sense” in the respondent’s
    situation.  The trial judge also indicated that remuneration for long haul
    trucking was comparable to the respondent’s former employment and that the
    respondent did not need a substantial amount of upgrading. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite
    the apparent availability of long haul trucking as suitable alternate employment
    for the respondent, the trial judge remarked that “there were a number of
    issues that had to be addressed”.  For example, the respondent lacked the
    financial resources to pay for the long haul trucking training program.  Also,
    the respondent did not qualify at the time for the i94 waiver to permit cross-border
    trucking, although the trial judge noted that there were opportunities in
    trucking within
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    that the respondent might have been able to exploit.  With respect to long
    haul trucking the trial judge commented: “Here was the obvious partnership
    in rehabilitation for these parties but neither pursued it, either at the
    time of the Post-104 DAC assessment or at the time of trial.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge then observed that the plaintiff had not qualified for long haul
    trucking at the time of his Post-104 DAC assessment or by trial, and might
    never qualify.  He then quoted from <i>Neumeyer v. Wawanesa Mutual Insurance
    Company</i> (2005), 29 C.C.L.I. (4th) 21 (Ont. Sup.
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ct.), at para. 29, in concluding that the respondent satisfied the test for
    continued disability in s. 5(2)(b) of the Schedule:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]hat on the balance of probabilities the evidence
    demonstrates that there were no realistic opportunities for full-time employment
    for the plaintiff given the expectations of a reasonable employer.  The plaintiff,
    in essence, was completely unable to engage in gainful employment for which
    she was reasonably suited by education, training or experience in the real
    world as of the date of trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge then concluded that the respondent was entitled to a continuing
    income replacement benefit under s. 4 of the Schedule.   </p>
  <h3>IV.       ANALYSIS</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge carefully reviewed all of the evidence and made his findings.  His
    findings of fact are not questioned on appeal.  I need mention the evidence
    only to the extent necessary to explain his findings.  Moreover, the trial
    judge quite properly considered the decisions of the arbitrators from the
    FSCO and its predecessor.  As he aptly remarked, although these decisions
    are not binding upon the court, they are helpful in understanding how these
    specialized commissions have interpreted and applied the Schedule.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Despite
    his able discussion of the proper principles, the trial judge ultimately
    applied the wrong test for determining whether the appellant satisfied the
    s.&nbsp;5(2)(b) standard for entitlement to a continuing income replacement
    benefit under s. 4.  In the end, the trial judge found that the respondent
    was entitled to the benefit because he “was not qualified either at the assessment
    or by trial, and might never qualify”, for long haul trucking. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    proper test, which the trial judge recognized earlier in his reasons, is
    whether, “as a result of the accident, the insured person is suffering a
    complete inability to engage in any employment for which he or she is reasonably
    suited by education, training or experience”.  It is not necessary that the
    insured person be formally qualified and able to begin work immediately in
    order for a particular employment to be considered a reasonably suitable
    alternative.  A job for which the insured is not already qualified may be
    a suitable alternative if substantial upgrading or retraining is not required.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge earlier found as a fact that the respondent did not require substantial
    upgrading or retraining to engage in long haul trucking. He also found that
    job opportunities were available in the field; it paid similar remuneration
    as the respondent’s past employment; and, while an i94 waiver was required
    to permit cross-border trucking, the trial judge observed that there were
    trucking jobs within
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  Most importantly, the medical and vocational evidence indicated that the
    respondent could perform the duties of the job.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    findings lead inexorably to the conclusion that long haul trucking was an
    employment alternative for which the respondent was reasonably suited by
    education, training or experience.  Nonetheless, in what was undoubtedly
    an effort to devise what he perceived to be an equitable result, the trial
    judge took into account that the respondent was not qualified for long haul
    trucking because he could not afford the training course and the parties
    had not pursued the obvious and necessary rehabilitation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge misapprehended the respective roles
    of the insurer and the insured in the context of an accident benefits claim.  It
    points out that ss. 55 and 56 of the Schedule place an obligation on an insured
    “to participate in such rehabilitation as is reasonable, available and necessary
    to” engage in alternative employment for which the insured is reasonably
    suited, and “to make reasonable efforts to…obtain employment for which he
    or she was is reasonably suited”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    find it unnecessary to deal with this argument.  This case was not about
    the respondent’s entitlement to a rehabilitation benefit under s. 15 of the
    Schedule, which encompasses measures to reintegrate an insured person into
    the labour market, including the cost of vocational training.  Nor was it
    about his obligation to participate in such training.  It was also not about
    which party failed to pursue the rehabilitation opportunities. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    sole issue in this case, as raised by the respondent’s statement of claim
    was whether he suffered a complete inability to engage in any employment
    for which he was reasonably suited by education, training, or experience.  His
    position at trial was that no reasonably suitable employment alternative
    existed.  This had been his position even after the report prepared by Melissa
    Skirda identified long haul trucking as a suitable employment alternative.  He
    neither pleaded nor raised at trial the issue of his entitlement to a rehabilitation
    benefit.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the findings of the trial judge, long haul trucking was clearly a suitable
    alternative for the respondent, even though he lacked the formal qualifications
    for it both at the time of assessment and at trial.  The trial judge’s findings
    simply do not support his conclusion that the respondent is suffering from
    a complete inability to engage in any employment for which he is reasonably
    suited by education, training, or experience under s. 5(2)(b) of the Schedule.  Therefore,
    the respondent is not entitled to a continuing income replacement benefit
    under s. 4.   </p>
  <h3>V.        DISPOSITION</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would allow the appeal, set aside the judgment of the trial judge, and dismiss
    the action of the respondent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    costs of the appeal are fixed in the amount of $7,500.00 inclusive of GST
    and disbursements, in accordance with the agreement of counsel.  The costs
    of trial are remitted to be fixed by the trial judge.</p>
