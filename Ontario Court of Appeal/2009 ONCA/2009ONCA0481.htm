  <h4><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND AND FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Eastern
    Power Limited had created and lab-tested a technology for the transformation
    of municipal solid waste (“MSW”) into recyclable products.  If successful,
    the technology would enable municipalities to divert more MSW from landfill
    sites into recyclable processes.  It was therefore an attractive possibility.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Eastern
    was looking for a municipal “partner” willing to help demonstrate the new
    technology and with a site where it could build a demonstration plant in
    order to take the technology to the next step and show that it was workable
    and economically viable.  Eastern found an interested party in the City of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Guelph, which had a Wet-Dry Facility that could accommodate Eastern’s proposed
    plant.  Eastern made a formal Proposal to the City and, after a period of
    negotiation, persuaded
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Guelph to enter into an agreement with Eastern’s wholly-owned subsidiary,
    Super Blue Box Recycling Corp. (“Subbor”).  Subbor holds the patents for
    the technology in question, but otherwise has no assets.  It was a theme
    of Eastern’s pitch in the negotiations that
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Guelph would not incur any costs or liabilities in connection with the proposed
    project.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    agreement between
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Guelph and Subbor is dated November 6, 1998 (“the Agreement”).  It had two
    aspects: (a) a lease granting Subbor a leasehold interest to the site on
    which the demonstration facility was to be built, and (b) a portion setting
    out the respective rights and obligations of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Guelph and Subbor with respect to the demonstration project.  In addition,
    the Agreement included the Eastern Proposal referred to above as a schedule
    and provided that was
    “incorporated into and form[ed] part of [the] Agreement.”  Eastern was not
    a party to the Agreement.  However, the Eastern Proposal contained an undertaking
    that “Eastern Power will indemnify the City of
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Guelph against liability that may arise as a result of the pilot demonstration
    project.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Agreement was for a period of three years, subject to an automatic extension
    for a further three years in the event that the project facility accepted
    MSW during the first three years of the term.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  This provision is at the core of the lawsuit
    and the appeal because the central dispute between the parties is whether
    the automatic three-year extension was triggered on January 28, 2000 leading
    to a termination date of January 28, 2003, as the City asserts, or on October
    30, 2001 or some later date, as Subbor and Eastern assert.  The trial judge
    found in favour of the City on this issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Article
    4(1) of the Agreement states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The term of this lease shall be for three (3) years
    from the date of execution of the Agreement and Lease by both parties.  Should
    the Demonstration Plant accept MSW Feedstock within the first three (3) years
    of this lease, the lease shall then be automatically extended for a further
    three (3) years from the date such MSW Feedstock is accepted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“Demonstration
    Plant” and “MSW Feedstock” are both defined in the Agreement:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>“Demonstration Plant” shall mean any and all equipment
    required for a facility to demonstrate the SUBBOR Technology and any associated
    structures including material handling, digestion, biogas collection and
    energy conversion equipment, Utilities Interfaces and other related equipment
    as deemed appropriate and supplied by the Company to demonstrate their SUBBOR
    Technology.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>“MSW Feedstock” shall mean any municipal solid
    waste material supplied to the Demonstration Plant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“Company” is
    also defined:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>“Company” shall mean Super Blue Box Recycling Corp.
    an Ontario Company and a wholly owned subsidiary of Eastern Power Limited.  “Company” shall
    also mean and include any successor of the Company or any permitted assignee
    of the Company.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    development of the project led to a number of disputes between the parties.  The
    nature of these disputes is not material to the appeal.  Suffice it to say,
    they led to the City taking the position that the Agreement had an early
    termination date – January 28, 2003 – and seeking a court declaration to
    that effect.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants took a different view.  They argued for a later termination date
    (October 30, 2004 or later).  They also asserted that the City had itself
    breached the Agreement in various ways including its early termination, which
    allegedly deprived the appellants of the reasonable period of time they required
    to develop the project for demonstration purposes.  The appellants counterpunched
    for $30 million in damages.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>MacKenzie
    J. found in favour of the City on all issues.  He declared that the Agreement
    expired effective January 28, 2003 and required Subbor to discharge any outstanding
    obligations under the Agreement, to surrender the premises, remove the Demonstration
    Plant, and restore the site to its original condition.  He dismissed Subbor’s
    counterclaim and ordered Eastern to pay the City’s costs of the proceedings
    (including any costs Subbor was obliged to pay but did not) and to “indemnify
    the City for any liabilities arising out of Subbor’s demonstration project,
    including any damages recoverable by Subbor against the City.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Subbor
    and Eastern appeal, attacking the trial judge’s interpretation of Article
    4(1) of the Agreement and various of his alternative findings with respect
    to damages.  They also contest his finding that Eastern was liable to indemnify
    the City.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the appeal, we did not call on the respondent with respect to the contractual
    interpretation ground of appeal, which is dismissed for the brief reasons
    that follow.  It is therefore unnecessary to deal with the grounds of appeal
    relating to damages.  We heard argument with respect to the indemnity issue,
    but on reflection we would dismiss that ground of appeal as well for the
    reasons that follow.</p>
  <h3>ANALYSIS</h3>
  <h3>Liability: The Contractual Interpretation Issue</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    City argues that the second three-year term of the Agreement began on January
    28, 2000 because on that date the Subbor facility first accepted approximately
    30 tonnes of MSW.  The appellants do not dispute that MSW in those amounts
    was received at that time.  They submit, however – based on the definition
    of “Demonstration Plant” in the Agreement and the state of evolution of the
    project at that time – that the project facility had not then evolved to
    the point where it had reached the status of a “Demonstration Plant”
    and, accordingly, that it could not have “accepted” MSW as contemplated by
    Article 4(1) as of January 28, 2000.  The reception of waste at that time
    was merely for purposes of commissioning or testing the “Front End” of the
    plant.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants contend, in effect, that the facility must have been substantially
    completed for demonstration purposes – if not for full production – before
    the automatic extension provisions of Article 4(1) could be triggered.  The
    correct interpretation of the Agreement and of Article 4(1), they say, requires
    the court to give meaning to all of the words in the definition of “Demonstration
    Plant”.  The triggering event under Article 4(1) – delivery and acceptance
    of MSW – could only be engaged, then, when “any and all equipment required … to
    demonstrate the SUBBOR Technology”
    was in place and “deemed appropriate … by [Subbor] to demonstrate their SUBBOR
    Technology.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge did not accept the appellant’s submissions.  He found that the
    language of the Agreement unambiguously gave effect to the intention of the
    parties, which was not to limit “acceptance” of MSW to delivery for the purpose
    of operating the Demonstration Plant as a unitary whole or to create an entirely
    subjective criterion – open only to Subbor – to establish the triggering
    event.  No commercial absurdity flowed from this conclusion.  He also rejected
    the appellants’ factual contention that the January 28 2000 delivery and
    acceptance occurred at a time when Subbor was commissioning only the “Front
    End”
    of the Demonstration Plant.  The trial judge found that this contention was
    completely at odds with representations being made by Subbor around the same
    time about the state of development of the project not only to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Guelph but to other municipalities, to various trade journals, and to its
    funding agency.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree.  It seems to us that the parties intended to engage the automatic
    extension provision once the project facility was able to accept MSW for
    processing.  Subbor would then have three years to complete the development
    and testing of the plant and to demonstrate the efficacy and commercial viability
    of its new technology.  Then, as provided in Article 4(2), if Subbor
    “has deemed the Demonstration Plant a success” and “the City has realized
    auditable and independently verifiable cost savings or other financial benefits
    over $250,000 based on criteria established solely by the City”, the parties
    could extend for a further ten years “as negotiated”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    would add that, in our view, the appellants’ rigid application of the definition
    of “Demonstration Plant” to the triggering of the extension provision, and
    the requirement to apply that same meaning to the term
    “Demonstration Plant” throughout the Agreement, would themselves lead to
    commercial absurdities in a number of instances.  Two examples of this are
    the provisions related to insurance and ownership of technology.  If the
    appellants’ argument were to prevail, Subbor would have no obligation to
    insure the facility, nor would it have any ownership interest in any newly
    discovered technology, prior to the project being at least in full demonstration
    mode.  This makes no sense.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the trial judge’s interpretation of the Agreement was correct and
    in accordance with the applicable principles of contractual interpretation:
    see <i>Consolidated Bathurst Export Ltd. v. Mutual Boiler and Machinery Insurance
    Co.</i>, [1980] 1 S.C.R. 888; <i>BG Checo International Ltd. v. British Columbia
    Hydro and Power Authority</i>, [1993] 1 S.C.R. 12; <i>Ventas, Inc. v. Sunrise
    Senior Living Real Estate Investment Trust</i> (2007), 85 O.R. (3d) 254 (C.A.). </p>
  <h3>The Indemnity Issue</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge gave effect to the City’s third party claim against Eastern for
    indemnity.  Although Eastern was not a party to the Agreement, the claim
    was based on Eastern’s Proposal as incorporated into the Agreement.  The
    City also emphasized the provisions in the Agreement that make it clear that
    the intention of the parties to the Agreement was that the City would incur
    no costs or liabilities arising out of the project.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the trial judge noted, Eastern resisted the claim on the grounds:</p>
  <p style='line-height:
200%;'>a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that
    it was not a party to the Agreement;</p>
  <p style='line-height:
200%;'>b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that
    the enabling resolution of the City of
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    Guelph made no mention of Eastern when authorizing the City to sign a contract
    between
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Guelph and Subbor;</p>
  <p style='line-height:
200%;'>c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that
    in the course of negotiations there had been discussions that Eastern would
    not be a guarantor of Subbor’s duties and obligations under the Agreement;
    and</p>
  <p style='line-height:
200%;'>d)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>that
    a party cannot be indemnified against the consequences of its own negligence
    unless the indemnity obligation is imposed in the clearest of terms.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since
    the trial judge found no negligence on the part of the City, the latter submission
    is not relevant to the appeal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge concluded at paras. 285-286:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In this case, [Eastern] is involved in the indemnity
    undertaking through its involvement in a larger transaction and the contractual
    undertaking of [Eastern] is one of indemnity and not guarantee.  Here, the “larger
    transaction” is the demonstration project for the technology in respect of
    which Subbor, as a fully owned subsidiary of [Eastern], was the delivery
    mechanism or vehicle for the technology.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In the result, I conclude that the City has the
    remedy of indemnification from [Eastern] with respect to any liabilities

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view this result is sustainable on the particular facts of this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Eastern
    was the entity promoting and carrying out the waste processing project, albeit
    that it was doing the latter through its wholly-owned subsidiary, Subbor.  The
    Proposal called for an agreement between <i>it</i> and the City, and undertook
    to indemnify the City “against liability that may arise as a result of the
    pilot demonstration project.”  When Gregory Vogt – Eastern’s and Subbor’s
    representative – spoke to City Council just four days before the Agreement
    was executed, he assured Council that “we [i.e., Eastern/Subbor] will be
    providing all of the funding, <i>all the costs, all the risks and liabilities
    that go with</i> [the demonstration project] (emphasis added)”.  He went
    on to say:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Let’s talk about the costs to
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Guelph.  … We’re not expecting any operational costs or support, <i>no liabilities,
    and no other costs whatsoever</i>.  This is something that’s an initiative
    that we together with Industry
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    have developed and fully anticipate to pay all costs for. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the face of these assurances, the Eastern Proposal was made a schedule to
    the Agreement and was specifically stated in Article 2 to be
    “incorporated into” and to “[form] part of this Agreement.”  While Eastern
    itself was not made a party to the Agreement – for reasons not anywhere explained – the
    Agreement specifically underscores, both in the recitals and in the definition
    of the “Company”, that Subbor is a wholly owned subsidiary of Eastern.  The
    recitals also reflect that the City’s original resolution authorized the
    development of “a draft agreement between the City and Eastern Power Ltd.
    for Council’s consideration” and that the agreement was subsequently prepared
    by Subbor.  That the final Council resolution authorizing the agreement with
    Subbor makes no specific mention of Eastern is inconsequential in our opinion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor
    is the fact that the parties negotiated to omit a guarantee by Eastern dispositive.  The
    omission of a guarantee and the existence of an indemnity are not incompatible.  The
    City does not say it is entitled to a guarantee of Subbor’s performance under
    the Agreement.  It says it is entitled to be indemnified for any costs and
    liabilities it may incur in connection with the demonstration project on
    the basis of Eastern’s separate undertaking to do so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s view that Eastern was “involved in the indemnity undertaking
    through its involvement in a larger transaction” is therefore well-founded
    in the factual matrix underlying the Agreement.  Eastern effectively asked
    the City to accept its proposal (including the indemnity found therein) and
    to enter into an agreement with its wholly-owned subsidiary to put it into
    effect.  In exchange, it held out that it would give substance to the Proposal
    and that the City would be indemnified and held harmless against all costs
    and liabilities associated with or arising out of the demonstration project.  The
    City accepted this proposal by entering into the Agreement with Subbor.  This
    was sufficient offer, acceptance, and consideration to make the undertaking
    to indemnify enforceable in the circumstances.</p>
