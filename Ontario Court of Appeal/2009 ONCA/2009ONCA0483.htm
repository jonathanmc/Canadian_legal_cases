    Ontario, must a justice of the peace receive an information if neither the

    jurisdiction to which the justice has been appointed?  That question lies
    at the heart of this appeal.  Its answer depends on the meaning of “territorial

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>OVERVIEW </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Jacqueline
    Ellis (“Ms. Ellis” or “the appellant”), a private citizen, appeared at the
    Justice of the Peace Office at
    <st1:PlaceName
w:st="on">
    Old
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    City Hall in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto on May 17, 2006.  She wanted to lay a charge and swear an information
    in relation to events said to have taken place in or around
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Hanover,
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario.  Neither Ms. Ellis nor the “accused” are residents of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Toronto.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    administrative purposes, the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">
    province of
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Ontario is divided into eight regions.  Metropolitan
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto is in the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto region.  The alleged offences are said to have occurred in the Central
    West region.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justice
    of the Peace Lau is assigned to the administrative region of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto.  She refused to receive the information on the basis that the matter
    had no connection to the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Toronto region.  She advised Ms. Ellis to attend before a justice of the
    peace in the region in which
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Hanover is located.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Ellis then appeared before Ewaschuk J. of the Superior Court of Justice seeking
    an order compelling Justice of the Peace Lau to receive her information.  She
    subpoenaed a police officer from
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Hanover to attend the proceedings.  Ewaschuk J. refused to issue the order
    on the basis that the matter had no connection to the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto region. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Ellis now appeals to this court.  She continues to seek an order which would
    enable her to lay the information in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown opposes the appeal.  It acknowledges that a justice of the peace must
    receive an information provided that it is valid on its face and within the
    “territorial jurisdiction” of the justice.  However, it contends that “territorial
    jurisdiction” is a reference to the administrative regions in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario and not the entire
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    province of
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Ontario.  Consequently, it argues, as neither the appellant nor the person
    named in the information are residents of the City of Toronto and the alleged
    incidents of criminal conduct occurred in and around Hanover, Ontario, there
    is no connection to Toronto and the justice correctly declined to receive
    the information.       </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE ISSUE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    jurisdiction of a justice of the peace to receive an information flows from
    s. 504 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  Section 504 makes it mandatory that
    a justice of the peace receive an information, provided that there is a connection
    between the person whom it is alleged has committed an indictable offence
    and the “territorial jurisdiction” of the justice.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As “territorial
    jurisdiction” is not defined in the <i>Criminal Code</i>, this appeal depends
    on the meaning to be given to those words.  Specifically, it must be decided
    whether “territorial jurisdiction”
    refers to the administrative regions created by the <i>Courts of Justice
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, or whether it refers to the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    province of
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Ontario.  If “territorial jurisdiction” is interpreted as referring to administrative
    regions, Justice of the Peace Lau was entitled to refuse to receive the information.  If,
    however, it refers to the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    province of
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Ontario, the justice was obliged to receive the information.    </p>

    the breadth of this definition is worthy of note.  </p>

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            <i>The Appellant</i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

'>[1]</span></span></span></a> in the <i>Criminal Code </i>refers to the province
    of Ontario.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Feige</i>,
    the court considered the meaning of “territorial jurisdiction” in s. 470
    of the <i>Criminal Code</i> for the purpose of determining whether a provincial
    court judge had jurisdiction to hear a particular matter.  Ferguson J. concluded
    that “territorial jurisdiction” refers to the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">
    province of
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Ontario because provincial judges have jurisdiction throughout the province.  He
    rejected the notion that “territorial jurisdiction” refers to the region
    to which a provincial court judge has been assigned for administrative purposes.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Hackett</i>,
    Aitken J. concluded that “territorial jurisdiction” meant the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">
    province of
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Ontario for the purposes of s. 504 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>.  The alleged
    offences in <i>Hackett </i>occurred in the East Region but the information
    was sworn before a justice of the peace in the
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Toronto region.  The information contained one charge alleged to have occurred
    in the Toronto Region; however, that charge was withdrawn.  The applicant
    was ordered to proceed to a preliminary inquiry.  On arraignment, the defence
    moved to quash the information and stay the proceedings on the basis that
    the justice had been without jurisdiction to receive the information.  The
    motion to quash was dismissed on the ground that “territorial jurisdiction” in
    s. 504 meant the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">
    province of
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Ontario.  The defence brought an application in the nature of <i>certiorari </i>to
    quash the order.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Aitken
    J. dismissed the application.  She observed that the <i>Courts of Justice
    Act </i>created regions for administrative, not jurisdictional, purposes.  Section
    504, on the other hand, “refers to the concept of jurisdiction, not the concept
    of courts administration”: <i>Hackett</i> at para. 15.  Consequently, Aitken
    J. held that the justice was entitled to receive the information even though
    the offences were alleged to have occurred outside the region and the alleged
    offender neither resided nor was found in the region.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Ponnuthurai</i>,

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto.  The charge was laid in

    court judge sitting in

    Toronto.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    798 of the <i>Criminal Code </i>states that a summary conviction court has
    jurisdiction over proceedings “in the territorial division over which the
    person who constitutes that court has jurisdiction.”  The accused argued

    J. rejected that argument.  She relied heavily on the reasoning in <i>Hackett</i>.  In
    addition, she reviewed the legislative history of the <i>Courts of Justice

    Ontario is to be viewed as a single jurisdictional unit – amendments dividing
    Ontario into judicial regions and changing the name of the court were administrative
    only and did not affect the territorial jurisdiction of Ontario Court of

    division” in s. 798 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, when considered in conjunction
    with the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, is the entire

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Gentles</i>,
    a private investigator was retained to investigate the death of Mr. Gentles.  He

    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto alleging that Mr. Gentles was killed by named prison guards while
    incarcerated at the Kingston Penitentiary.  Immediately after the information

     The justice of the peace consulted </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>with the Senior Regional Justice of the Peace, who in
    turn consulted with the Coordinator of Justices of the Peace for
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario.  It was determined that the pre-inquiry should be held in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Kingston, where the offences were alleged to have occurred. After receiving
    submissions on the jurisdictional issue, the Senior Regional Justice concluded
    that s. 507 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> allowed for any justice, not just
    the receiving justice, to conduct the pre-inquiry under s. 507.  Further,
    in his role as coordinator, the Coordinator of Justices of the Peace was
    entitled to direct that the pre-inquiry should be held by a justice in the
    Eastern Region.  The informant sought <i>mandamus</i> and <i>certiorari</i> in
    aid.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moldaver
    J. dismissed the application.  He held that it was “perfectly proper for
    the s. 507 hearing to be conducted by a justice other than the s. 504 receiving
    justice, with or without the consent of the informant”: <i>Gentles</i> at
    para. 30.  First, as a matter of authority, it had long been established
    that the justice conducting the s. 507 hearing need not be the same as the
    s. 504 justice.  While ss. 504 and 507 were related, and while the same justice
    would usually carry out both functions in practice, the <i>Criminal Code</i> did
    not proscribe the carrying out of the two distinct functions by different
    justices.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    accepting the applicant’s submission – that unless the informant consented
    to having different justices perform the ss. 504 and 507 hearings, they would
    have to be performed by one justice – would wreak havoc on the administration
    of justice.  It would mean that any informant would be able to “pick and
    choose the location of the s. 507 hearing, irrespective of any and all concerns
    regarding the proper and efficient administration of justice”: <i>Gentles </i>at
    para. 22.  Moldaver J. cited the
    “scarcity of judicial resources and tremendous backlogs which exist in some
    jurisdictions”, as well as the “time honoured principle that generally, criminal
    matters should be dealt with in the locale where the alleged offence is said
    to have committed”: <i>Gentles </i>at paras. 15, 22.  At para. 24, he noted
    that, “the legislature has seen fit, for the most part, to place in the hands
    of the judiciary the tools necessary to ensure the most efficient and effective
    use of judicial personnel and resources.”  It was not for informants or accused
    persons “to drive the administration of justice as they see fit”.  Rather,
    it was “the responsibility of the judiciary… to determine the allocation
    of judicial work and the assignment of individual judicial officers to individual
    cases”: <i>Gentles</i> at paras. 24-25. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    accepting the applicant’s submission would lead to forum shopping.  At para.
    19, Moldaver J. stated that “any proposition which would countenance the
    right of a party to select the presiding judicial officer must not only be
    discouraged; it must be soundly and unequivocally rejected.”  Moldaver J.
    drew a distinction between hearings under ss. 504 and 507.  At paras. 17-18,
    he stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[I]t must be remembered that whereas the functions
    of a justice under s. 504 are largely administrative, the s. 507 determination
    is judicial in nature. <i>Pursuant to s. 504 of the Code, an informant is
    entitled to lay an information before any justice in the province and such
    information must be received if the preconditions of that provision have
    been met.</i> All counsel agreed with this principle. (R. v. Whitmore (1988),
    41 C.C.C. (3d) 555 (Ont. H.C.); affirmed at (1990), 51 C.C.C. (3d) 294 (Ont.

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='color:black'>Thereafter, the functions
      of the justice cease to be administrative. The important next step involves
      a pre-inquiry under s. 507 of the Code to determine whether or not process
      should issue. That involves a judicial determination on the part of a justice.
      In other words, the decision to issue or refuse process must be exercised
      judicially. (R. v. Whitmore, supra; Buchbinder and The Queen (1985), 20

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    statutory interpretation argument is based on the fact that “territorial

    they must mean different things because if Parliament had intended the same

    J. rejected this argument, saying that to equate
    “territorial jurisdiction” with “province” in s. 504 would render the references
    to “territorial jurisdiction” redundant.  At para. 24 he stated:    </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>If territorial jurisdiction in s. 504 means
      the Province of Ontario because justices of the peace have province-wide
      jurisdiction, then a justice, in a case that may be tried in Ontario, can

      residing or believed to be residing anywhere in Ontario</i>.  Assuming

      any part of

    has to apply for a change of venue would never need to but could determine

    second reason given by the Crown in support of its position is that criminal
    trials should be held in the locality in which the alleged crime took place.  Garrow

    each judge had jurisdiction to sit throughout the province, references to
    “territorial jurisdiction” in the <i>Criminal Code</i> were no longer relevant.  He
    saw s. 14 of the <i>Provincial Courts Act</i>, R.S.O. 1970, c. 369 as significant
    because it preserved the territorial jurisdiction of the county and district
    courts.</span>  </p>

lang=EN>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    policy reason on which the Crown relies is the efficient use of public resources.  It
    contends that to permit an information to be laid in any region of the province,
    without restriction, would result in an inefficient use of public resources
    because on reception, a judge or designated justice in the region where the
    information is laid must hear and consider the allegations of the informant.</p>

    case for doing so is made out”, pursuant to s. 507.1(2), a warrant or, more
    likely, a summons, shall then be issued to compel the accused to attend before
    the justice and answer the charge.  Pursuant to s. 509(2), a summons must
    be personally served on the accused.  The Crown contends that if s. 504 is
    interpreted to mean the entire
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    province of
    <st1:PlaceName

    Ontario, police in the jurisdiction where the information is laid will either
    have to travel to the region where the accused is resident or coordinate
    with local police to have the summons served on the accused through the local
    sheriff’s office.  Further, if proceedings are eventually commenced, the
    accused, the complainant, the witnesses and any investigating officers would
    have to travel to the region where the information was laid.  The Crown argues
    that this would be inefficient since the Attorney General or the accused
    would, in all likelihood, apply for a change of venue to return the matter
    back to the region where the information ought to have been laid in the first
    place.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, “territorial jurisdiction” in s. 504 of the <i>Criminal Code </i>refers
    to the entire

    Ontario.  The fact that the <i>Courts of Justice Act </i>divides
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario into regions for administrative purposes does not alter the jurisdiction
    conferred on justices by s. 504 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. <i> </i>As Aitken
    J. stated in <i>Hackett </i>at para. 15, “[t]he regions created under the
    Courts of Justice Act<i> </i>are created for administrative purposes related
    to the administration of justice in the province; they are not created for
    jurisdictional purposes.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Contrary
    to the Crown’s submission, interpreting
    “territorial jurisdiction” in s. 504 as the entire
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">
    province of
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Ontario does not offend the principles of statutory interpretation.  The<i> Criminal
    Code </i>is federal legislation, governing all of the provinces and territories.  Adopting
    one interpretation for one province does not dictate such a result elsewhere
    in the country.  In other parts of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    , where legislative schemes governing the systems of court may be different, “territorial
    jurisdiction” may well have a different meaning.  In my view, the phrase “territorial
    jurisdiction” in s. 504, like the definition of
    “territorial division” in s. 2 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, provides the
    flexibility necessary to accommodate provincial and territorial differences:
    see <i>Hackett </i>at para. 10. Accordingly, interpreting “territorial jurisdiction” in
    s. 504 to mean the province of Ontario does not necessarily render that phrase
    redundant simply because the word “province” is used elsewhere in that section.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    the reference in s. 504 to “territorial jurisdiction” in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario may be explained on an historical basis.  Historically, in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario, justices were appointed to a particular county or docket.  At that
    time, their jurisdiction may have been limited to the territory to which
    they had been appointed.  However, the enactment of the <i>Courts of Justice
    Act, 1984</i>, S.O. 1984, c. 11 “brought about significant changes in court
    structure” and “altered the approach to territorial divisions within the
    province”: see <i>Ponnuthurai </i>at p. 443.  Separate provincial courts
    of each county and district were amalgamated into province-wide courts.  After
    a detailed review of the legislative history of the Act and the subsequent
    amendments, Pringle J. stated at p. 445 of <i>Ponnuthurai</i>::</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>When the language of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i> was
    amended to indicate that the division of the province into regions was for
    administrative as opposed to jurisdictional purposes, it is logical to infer
    that regions no longer had jurisdictional significance, but rather only administrative
    [significance]. <i>The effect of the legislation was thus to create different
    administrative regions within a single jurisdictional unit. </i>[Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    notion of a single jurisdictional unit is further reflected in s. 17(1) of
    the <i>Justices of the Peace Act</i> which, as has been mentioned, states
    that justices of the peace have jurisdiction throughout the province.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the Crown that there are good administrative reasons to have cases
    that arise in a particular region tried in that region.  However, I do not
    accept that interpreting “territorial jurisdiction” as the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">
    province of
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Ontario for the purposes of s. 504 of the <i>Criminal Code </i> offends this
    principle.  The fact that an information is received in a particular region
    does not mean that any resulting criminal trial must take place in that region.  Indeed,
    as <i>Gentles </i>makes clear, it does not necessarily mean that a pre-inquiry
    must proceed in that region.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Gentles</i>,
    Moldaver J. explained that while an informant is entitled to lay an information
    under s. 504 before any justice in the province, in the ordinary case, a
    hearing under s. 507 (and, presumably s. 507.1) should be conducted where
    the offence was alleged to have been committed.  At several points in his
    reasons, he reiterated the “time honoured principle that generally, criminal
    matters should be dealt with in the locale where the alleged offence is said
    to have been committed”: <i>Gentles</i> at paras. 22.  However, Moldaver
    J. recognized that there may be “rare cases where requiring the s. 507 hearing
    to proceed in a certain region would effectively deny the informant his or
    her right to pursue a legitimate complaint”: <i>Gentles </i>at para. 28.  In
    these cases, “<span class=verdana>clearly, there should be some mechanism
    in place whereby an informant can make his or her views known and considered
    before the matter is directed to another locale”: <i>Gentles</i> at para.
    32.</span> At paras. 28-29, Moldaver J. offered the following illustrative
    examples:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Take for example the case of an informant who is
    bed-ridden and physically unable to travel to an outlying region; or the
    case of a prisoner now residing at Beaver Creek, who wishes to lay charges
    against inmates or prison guards at Millhaven but who, for reasons of safety,
    fears returning to a prison in Kingston; or the case of a single parent who
    is unable to arrange for child care which would be necessitated by his or
    her absence from home for any significant period of time.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>These are but a few examples of the kinds of
      situations which could arise and for which, flexibility must exist.</i> [Emphasis
      added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>Moldaver J. attributed this flexibility to the broad
    grant of jurisdiction in s. 17(1) of the <i>Justices of the Peace Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    follows from the above that I do not find the Crown’s argument that a broad
    interpretation of “territorial jurisdiction” in s. 504 would lead to an inefficient
    use of public resources to be particularly persuasive.  Interpreting “territorial
    jurisdiction” in s. 504 so as to allow an informant to swear an information
    before any justice in the province does not necessarily entail any inconvenience
    or expense for either the parties or the witnesses to a criminal proceeding.  As
    in <i>Gentles</i> itself, a pre-inquiry may be directed to proceed in a region
    other than the informant’s choosing out of a concern for the orderly administration
    of justice or the principle that criminal matters should be dealt with where
    they occurred. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    a broad interpretation of “territorial jurisdiction” in s. 504 ensures both
    flexibility and efficiency in those rare situations described by Moldaver
    J. where there is a legitimate reason for the pre-inquiry to be held in a
    location other than where the alleged offence was committed.  In such circumstances,
    both the s. 504 hearing and the pre-inquiry may proceed before a single justice
    in a different region, consistent with common practice.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    the Crown’s concerns regarding the efficient use of public resources should
    not be overstated.  To some extent, the Crown’s argument for restricting
    the definition of “territorial jurisdiction” rests on statements made in <i>O’Gorman </i>and <i>Simons</i>.  With
    respect, those cases are neither binding nor particularly relevant at this
    point in history.  They were decided well before the amalgamation of the
    provincial courts in 1984.  Moreover, as a result of advances in communication
    and travel, the concerns which underlay those decisions are not as pressing
    as they once were.  As Aitken J. explained in <i>Hackett</i> at para. 15:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=verdana>The realities of the times
      when the principles in the O'Gorman and Simons cases were enunciated were
      very different from our current realities. With communications being virtually
      instantaneous throughout the province, with travel being commonplace, and
      with the time required for travel from one locale to another in the province
      having been drastically reduced over the last century, some of the policy
      concerns for having a restricted definition of &quot;territorial jurisdiction&quot; under
      s. 504 of the Criminal Code are not as pressing.</span> </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    to the extent that the Crown’s opposition to a broad interpretation of “territorial
    jurisdiction” in s. 504 is based on a concern about forum shopping, I would
    simply add this.   Section 504 is administrative in nature – as long as the
    preconditions are met, the justice must receive the information.  Any concerns
    about forum shopping can surely be addressed at a later stage in the process:
    see <i>Gentles</i> at paras. 21, 33.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I would allow the appeal, set aside the decision below and issue an order
    requiring the justice to receive the information.  </p>

lang=EN-US> Section 507 sets out the procedure to be followed for issuing process
      where an information is laid in a public prosecution.  Section 507.1 sets
      out the procedure to be followed for private prosecutions.  In a public
      prosecution under s. 507, the justice receiving the information shall hear
      and consider, <i>ex parte</i>, the allegations of the informant and, if
      the justice considers it desirable or necessary, the evidence of witnesses.  In
      a private prosecution under s. 507.1, the receiving justice shall refer
      the information to a provincial court judge or a designated justice, to
      consider whether to compel the appearance of the accused.  The judge or
      designated justice must consider the allegations of the informant and the
      witnesses, as well as give the Attorney General a copy of the information,
      notice and an opportunity to attend the hearing and present evidence.  Under
      both processes, if “a case for doing so is made out”, the justice or the
      judge, as the case may be, shall issue either a summons or a warrant for
      the arrest of the accused to compel him or her to attend before a justice
      to answer the charge.</span></p>
