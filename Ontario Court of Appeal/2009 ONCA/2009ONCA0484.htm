  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Law Society of Upper Canada (the “Law Society”) and Matthew Igbinosun (“Igbinosun”),
    a lawyer found guilty of professional misconduct, bring separate appeals
    from the decision of the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court dated July 18, 2008.  That court set aside the order of
    the Law Society Appeal Panel (“Appeal Panel”), which had upheld a finding
    of professional misconduct and an order of disbarment against Igbinosun imposed
    by the Law Society Hearing Panel (“Hearing Panel”) on September 20, 2006.  The
    <st1:Street w:st="on">

    justice in two respects. First, during the liability phase, the Hearing Panel
    refused to grant Igbinosun a brief adjournment in order for him to be represented
    by counsel.  Second, after the liability phase had concluded, it failed to
    give Igbinosun adequate notice that it was proceeding with the penalty phase.  The
    Law Society appeals from these holdings.</span></p>

    this decision.  </span></p>

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Igbinosun
      was called to the Ontario Bar in February 1998.  In July 1999, the mother
      of a young person that Igbinosun was representing in a criminal matter
      made a complaint of sexual assault against him that resulted in criminal
      charges being laid. In July 2001, Igbinosun was charged with two further
      counts of sexual assault in relation to two different complainants. One
      of these complainants had a lien on her condominium unit, and met with
      Igbinosun to look into having the lien removed.  The other complainant
      was the property manager of a condominium corporation that Igbinosun was
      representing.    </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      addition, the three complainants each filed complaints regarding Igbinosun
      with the Law Society in 2001. On February 13, 2002, the Proceedings Authorization
      Committee (“PAC”) of the Law Society authorized an investigation into the
      complaints.  However, on May 22, 2002, the investigation was deferred by
      the PAC, pending the outcome of the criminal charges.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
      December 12, 2003, the criminal charges against Igbinosun were stayed for
      unreasonable delay under s. 11(b) of the <i>Charter</i>.  As a result,
      shortly after February 2, 2004, the PAC authorized the closing of the Law
      Society’s monitoring file on Igbinosun.  However, in March 2004, the Law
      Society learned that the three complainants still wished the Law Society
      investigation to continue, and that they each planned to bring a civil
      action against Igbinosun.  The Law Society proceeded to assign a new investigator
      to the three complaints.  On October 15, 2004, the investigator notified
      Igbinosun that the investigations into the three complaints were proceeding.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
      February 23, 2005, the PAC authorized the Notice of Application against
      Igbinosun.  Igbinosun was notified of this on March 15, 2005, and served
      with the Notice on April 1, 2005.  At some point after this, Igbinosun
      contacted Anil Kapoor, a lawyer who agreed to represent Igbinosun in the
      disciplinary proceedings, once full and complete disclosure was obtained.  Igbinosun
      first appeared before the Hearings Management Tribunal (“HMT”) on April
      25, 2005, at which time he was granted an adjournment to May 9, 2005.  Due
      to miscommunication, Igbinosun did not attend on that date, and the HMT
      set the hearing for the week of August 22, 2005.  </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
      May 24, 2005, the hearing date was vacated on consent.  On June 20, 2005,
      before the HMT, the hearing was re-set for October 24, 2005, and was ordered
      to proceed peremptorily.  Kapoor sought an adjournment of this date before
      the HMT on August 29, 2005, but this request was refused.  Another adjournment
      was sought on September 12, 2005, and this request was also refused.  These
      adjournments had been sought because Kapoor was already committed to acting
      in a murder trial on October 24, 2005, and thus would be unable to attend
      the hearing if it were not rescheduled.  Due to the HMT’s refusal to adjourn
      the hearing date, Kapoor was unable to act for Igbinosun, and ceased to
      do so.  </span></p>

      October 12, 2005, Igbinosun retained John J. Lawlor to represent him.  At
      the October 24, 2005 hearing date, Lawlor successfully had the hearing
      adjourned until February 27, 2006, again to proceed peremptorily.  As a
      condition of this adjournment, Igbinosun agreed to waive the period between
      June 22, 2005 and February 27, 2006 in his planned application to stay
      the proceedings for delay.  Igbinosun’s motion to stay the disciplinary
      proceedings for delay was heard on February 24 and 27, 2006.  The majority
      of the panel, W. Paul Dray and Holly Harris, dismissed it, while the Chair
      of the Panel, Ross W. Murray, Q.C., dissented. Lawlor then sought to adjourn
      the proceedings.  This request was refused, and the hearing commenced on
      February 28, 2006.  Written reasons for dismissing the application for
      a stay were released on April 27, 2006.</span></p>

      initial phase of the hearing before the Hearing Panel took place from February
      28, 2006 to March 3, 2006.  During this time, the Law Society completed
      its case.  Lawlor then indicated that he intended to call evidence.  However,
      due to other commitments, the Hearing Panel was unable to hear defence
      evidence at that time.  As a result, the hearing was adjourned without
      a fixed date for continuation being set.<a

      in a letter dated May 23, 2006, Lawlor informed Igbinosun that he intended
      to bring a motion to remove himself as counsel of record.  Lawlor’s stated
      reasons for doing this were his perception that Igbinosun had lost confidence
      in him, as well as Igbinosun’s refusal to provide Lawlor with statements
      documenting what Igbinosun and other defence witnesses intended to say
      at the hearing.  On June 5, 2006, Lawlor contacted the Tribunals Office
      of the Law Society to indicate his intention to remove himself from the
      record.  In an e-mail dated June 7, 2006, Lawlor informed Igbinosun that
      he (Igbinosun) and any new counsel that he may have retained must participate
      in the June 19 conference call.  On that same day, Igbinosun responded
      to Lawlor, stating that he was not available on June 19 and that he was
      under the belief that Lawlor would represent him on the call.  In a letter
      dated June 7, 2006, Lawlor responded to Igbinosun, and told him that he
      would be present for the conference call, but that Igbinosun was also required
      to take part.  </span></p>

      June 19, Igbinosun did not participate in the conference call.  Lawlor
      did participate in the conference call and indicated that he would be seeking
      to remove himself from the record but that Igbinosun had asked him to represent
      him on the call.  During a discussion about when members of the panel and
      counsel were available to continue with the hearing, September 18 was suggested.
      Lawlor indicated that he was available on that date. The hearing was scheduled
      to continue on September 18, 2006, peremptorily. </span></p>

      July 21, 2006, Lawlor’s motion to be removed as counsel of record was dealt
      with by way of teleconference by the Hearing Panel.  Igbinosun joined the
      call late and tried to persuade the panel to revisit its decision to allow
      Lawlor to be removed from the record but was unsuccessful in doing so.
      Igbinosun tried to have the Panel adjourn the September 18 hearing date
      but was told to bring a motion. The first available date for the motion
      was September 14, 2006. On that date his request for a four month adjournment
      was refused.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span

      the day of the hearing, September 18, 2006, Miguna made several requests
      for adjournments.  First, he asked for the hearing to be rescheduled to
      either October 9, 2006 or November 1, 2006.  After this was denied, Miguna
      requested an adjournment of 48 hours (until the morning of Wednesday, September
      20, 2006). This request was also denied.  Finally, Miguna stated that he
      was willing to proceed immediately, but that he would need a recess at
      2:00 pm in order to attend a previously scheduled pre-trial.  While Miguna
      stated that he could continue the hearing the following day, Miguna had
      earlier informed the court that he had a motion in

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At
      the hearing of the appeal, Igbinosun argued that in a number of instances
      he had been wrongly denied adjournment requests by the Hearing Panel and
      the HMT, most particularly on September 18, 2006, and that, as a result,
      he had been denied natural justice.  The extracts below are taken from
      the Appeal Panel’s decision on this issue:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[54] The appellant’s own conduct
      did contribute to the denial of some of the adjournment requests.  There
      were repeated requests for adjournments by the appellant and reluctance
      to provide his availability to his counsel in meaningful blocks of time
      to assist in the scheduling of matters.  His communications to his counsel
      regarding his availability were more often characterized by a rejection
      of the specific date with no alternative provided.  <i>The denial of an
      adjournment in those circumstances did not amount to a denial of natural
      justice…</i></span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[60] The Hearing Panel was faced
      with a party that it viewed as having requested multiple adjournments.  It
      felt pressed to bring the matter to a conclusion, given the original filing
      of the Notice of Application in February of 2005.  However, on this specific
      date [Sept 18], the appellant demonstrated a clear intention to proceed.  His
      counsel was flexible and attempted to find various ways to accommodate
      the exigencies of the schedule.  The appellant was prepared to go ahead
      but did not wish to do so in the absence of counsel… </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[79]
    …The Appeal Panel finds that the denials of adjournments identified by the
    appellant, <i>save for the instance of September 18, 2006</i>, do not demonstrate
    a breach of natural justice.  The fact that the dates were peremptory on
    the appellant reflected the entitlement of the Hearing Panel to control its
    own processes…</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[90]
    …In this case, the appellant alleged a number of procedural matters that
    compromised his capacity to be heard.  In actuality, the Appeal Panel found
    that he was largely the author of his own misfortune and that<i> the initial
    hearing was indeed fair in all aspects.</i>  [Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>In
      its reasons, under the subheading “Denial of Adjournment Requests”, the
      Appeal Panel stated that it had “chosen to focus on the September 18, 2006,
      request and [would] discuss the cumulative impact of the denial of the
      other adjournment requests in a separate section on the right to counsel” (para.
      49).
     After reviewing some of the factors in the jurisprudence pertaining to the
    granting or refusal of an adjournment, the Appeal Panel cited the reasons
    of the Hearing Panel for refusing the September 18, 2006 adjournment (para.
    53).  In para. 54 of its reasons, the Appeal Panel went on to hold that Igbinosun’s
    conduct had contributed to the denial of some adjournments and that he had
    not been denied natural justice, but it did not specifically reference the
    adjournment request of September 18.  The Appeal Panel concluded this portion
    of its reasons by saying that matters such as scheduling involved the exercise
    of discretion.  It stated that the test to be applied was whether the Hearing
    Panel, in exercising its discretion, had taken into account legally impermissible
    considerations or otherwise acted arbitrarily.  However, in this part of
    its reasons, the Appeal Panel did not come to a conclusion as to whether
    the Hearing Panel had failed to consider a relevant consideration or analyze
    whether, in refusing the September 18, 2006 adjournment, the Hearing Panel
    erred in principle and denied Igbinosun natural justice.  </span></p>

      the heading “Right to Counsel”, by necessary implication, the Appeal Panel
      concluded that the refusal of an adjournment on September 18, 2006 was
      a denial of natural justice.  As quoted above, the Appeal Panel excepted
      the adjournment on September 18 from its conclusion, in para. 79 of its
      reasons, that there had been no denial of natural justice to Ignobisun.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>In
      its concluding paragraph, however, the Appeal Panel made no exception to
      its conclusion that the procedural matters raised by Igbinosun did not
      amount to a denial of natural justice,  and engaged in no further meaningful
      analysis of the issue. The Appeal Panel did not explain the reason for
      not excepting the September 18 adjournment from its final conclusion.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Reading
      the reasons as a whole, the Appeal Panel came to contradictory conclusions
      and failed to provide any reasons for its ultimate decision dismissing

      request for a brief adjournment on September 18 was refused. </span></p>

      the issue of procedural fairness in relation to the September 18 adjournment
      Molloy J., on behalf of the Court, found the reasons of the Appeal Panel
      to be
    “perplexing” (para. 52).  She held that
    “[n]owhere in its decision does the Appeal Panel ever analyze whether the
    refusal of an adjournment on September 18, 2006 constituted a breach of natural
    justice or set out its conclusion in that regard.”  While I read the Appeal
    Panel’s reasons as indicating that it came to a conclusion on this issue,
    I would agree with Molloy J. that the Appeal Panel did not give reasons for
    why it initially concluded that the refusal of an adjournment on September
    18 constituted a breach of natural justice. The path to the Appeal Panel’s
    later conclusion, that Igbinosun was not denied natural justice when Miguna’s
    request for a brief adjournment on September 18, 2006, is not visible, even
    taking into account the expanded record.  Appellate review is consequently
    not permitted.   </span></p>

    in deciding whether to grant or refuse an adjournment can be derived from
    these cases.  Factors which may support the denial of an adjournment may
    include a lack of compliance with prior court orders, previous adjournments
    that have been granted to the applicant, previous peremptory hearing dates,
    the desirability of having the matter decided and a finding that the applicant
    is seeking to manipulate the system by orchestrating delay.  Factors which
    may favour the granting of an adjournment include the fact that the consequences
    of the hearing are serious, that the applicant would be prejudiced if the
    request were not granted, and a finding that the applicant was honestly seeking
    to exercise his right to counsel, and had been represented in the proceedings
    up until the time of the adjournment request.  In weighing these factors,
    the timeliness of the request, the applicant’s reasons for being unable to
    proceed on the scheduled date and the length of the requested adjournment
    should also be considered. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Recall
      that the Hearing Panel’s reasons for refusing the adjournment, which are
      cited in the Appeal Panel’s reasons, were: a) the request for an adjournment
      had already been refused four days earlier; b) the matter had been marked
      peremptory; c) there was no certainty about when Miguna would be able to
      continue; and d) the matter had been awaiting resolution for a long time.  These
      reasons do not reflect a consideration of all the factors the circumstances
      of this case required and, particularly, the substantive factors related
      to the prejudice Igbinosun would experience if the request were denied.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Law Society submits that the issue of prejudice was taken into account by
    the Hearing Panel.  The only prejudice that the Hearing Panel considered
    was the prejudice to the public interest in the efficient administration
    of its proceedings, i.e. that the matter had been awaiting resolution for
    a long time.  The Hearing Panel did not consider the prejudice to Igbinosun
    of forcing him on without counsel nor weigh that prejudice against the public
    interest in having the matter proceed on September 18. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the Law Society argues that the expanded record before the Appeal Panel refutes
    the claim of prejudice to Igbinosun by being forced on without counsel, the
    Appeal Panel did not say this.  <span lang=EN-US>The Law Society submits
    that, in regard to the expanded record, the Divisonal Court failed to consider
    the impact of Igbinosun’s misrepresentation to the Hearing Panel concerning
    when he knew Lawlor was seeking to get off the record. However, the transcript
    indicates that Igbinosun’s misrepresentation occurred after the Hearing Panel
    had refused to grant him an adjournment on September 18, 2006 and in the
    context of telling the Panel that he would seek judicial review of their
    decision.  While it was clearly wrong for Igbinosun to try to mislead the
    Hearing Panel, his misrepresentation has no bearing on whether, at the time
    that the Hearing Panel refused his request for an adjournment, he was denied
    natural justice. </span></p>

      should have been more flexible about adjourning it.  She stated:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[63] The September 18, 2006 hearing date was set
    without Mr. Igbinosun’s input, at a time when the Hearing Panel knew Mr.
    Lawlor intended to get off the record.  I accept there is some fault attributable
    to Mr. Igbinosun for not participating in the teleconference and/or providing
    dates when he would be available to continue with the hearing.  However,
    at this point, Mr. Lawlor was still on the record and Mr. Igbinosun had not
    consented to his removal.  He clearly had not yet retained other counsel
    to represent him.  He had been represented by counsel throughout the process
    before the Society and in the criminal proceedings against him.  The Hearing
    Panel ought to have recognized that Mr. Igbinosun would be faced with the
    difficult task over the summer months of finding and retaining a lawyer who
    was prepared to step into a hearing already half-completed with a fixed and <i>peremptory </i>continuation
    date of September 18. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[64]  When Mr. Igbinosun did have an opportunity
    to address <i>the issue</i> [of the peremptory date of September 18] with
    the panel on the occasion of Mr. Lawlor’s removal from the record in July,
    2006, and stated that he could not be ready to proceed for the September
    hearing date, he was advised he would have to bring a motion.  The first
    date available to the Panel for that motion was only four days prior to the
    date set for the hearing.  Again, this was not of Mr. Igbinosun’s doing.  He
    brought his motion at the earliest opportunity.  The motion was denied. [Emphasis

      a lawyer willing to represent him.  His lawyer had two brief prior commitments,
      but was prepared to work around those and to proceed immediately, with
      short recesses to accommodate his previously scheduled court appearances.  As
      the Appeal Panel found, on September 18, Mr. Igbinosun “demonstrated a

    of a finding of misconduct was a loss of Igbinosun’s livelihood.  The desirability
    of having the matter determined on its merits was great.  Igbinosun had clearly
    expressed his desire to be represented by counsel and exercised that right
    in all the other proceedings.  The Law Society’s case had been presented.  Igbinosun
    was expected to testify and he wanted counsel to assist him and to protect
    him from inappropriate cross-examination.  As Molloy J. noted, there was
    no discernible prejudice to the Law Society or its witnesses in granting
    a brief adjournment.  The Hearing Panel gave no indication that it would
    not have been able to accommodate Igbinosun’s request to continue the hearing
    on September 20 or possibly earlier.  The Hearing Panel was required to balance

      record that <i>the elapsed time between the end of the finding of misconduct
      with notification to the appellant and the onset of the penalty phase was
      less than half a working day.</i>  The Society noted that the rapid progression
      led to its not meeting the notice requirements for provision of the victim
      impact statements or the bill of costs to the appellant.  <i>As noted below
      in the discussion of the right to be heard in the penalty phase</i>, <i>there
      was a clear breach of the principles of natural justice. </i>See <i>Sussman

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[77] The duty of fairness has
      recently been expanded by the Ontario Court of Appeal to consider the implications

    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario (Superintendent of Financial Services), </i>[2005] O.J. No. 4806

    Divisional Court’s decision, holding that an individual should be provided
    with the opportunity to present evidence and make submissions on penalty
    particularly when the implication is the possibility of the revocation of
    a licence.  The error in law was based upon a failure to: (a) give the appellant
    an opportunity to make submissions as to penalty; (b) consider alternatives
    that could have been imposed and (c) review or consider the penalties imposed
    in similar cases.  The Court of Appeal ordered that the penalty assessment
    proceed before a differently constituted tribunal who was to base its determinations
    on the findings already made by the Tribunal.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[78] The appellant in this case
      was provided with notice of the Hearing Panel’s intention to proceed to

      September 18, 2006.  <i>This two-day notice</i> was in contrast to the <i>Sussman </i>context
      where no notice was provided.  Finally, consideration must be given to
      the fact that the date was set peremptory on the appellant meaning that
      he should have been prepared to lead all components of his case, including

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>It was not reasonable to conclude

      stated that he would be seeking judicial review of its decision to refuse
      the brief adjournment requested by his counsel. </span></p>

lang=EN-US>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
      the issue whether the Hearing Panel had acted fairly in relation to the
      penalty phase of the hearing, Molloy J. cited the jurisprudence holding
      that a tribunal’s duty to act fairly will vary depending on the circumstances,
      and that where an individual’s livelihood is at stake a higher standard
      of justice is required (para. 66).  In her opinion, it was not reasonable
      for the Hearing Panel to proceed immediately to the penalty phase.  Although
      the hearing date was peremptory on both the Law Society and Igbinosun,
      counsel for the Law Society did not expect the penalty phase to occur immediately.  Without
      the Hearing Panel’s waiver of the 10-day notice requirement for receipt
      of victim impact statements, the earliest the Society could have proceeded
      was September 29.  Molloy J. noted that there was no urgency requiring
      the penalty phase to proceed so quickly.  The evidence at a penalty hearing
      is different from the evidence at a misconduct hearing and typically takes
      time to prepare.  The potentially serious consequences of the hearing to
      Igbinosun and lack of any prejudice to the Law Society warranted following
      the normal time lines.   In her view, at para. 51:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Mr. Igbinosun was denied any meaningful
      opportunity to be heard on the penalty to be imposed against him.  This
      was a very serious matter, with potentially dire consequences for Mr. Igbinosun.  There
      was no demonstrated prejudice to the Society if the penalty phase were
      to proceed at its normal pace with full notice to Mr. Igbinosun and a meaningful
      opportunity to prepare, present evidence and make submissions. Proceeding
      with the imposition of penalty in this manner was a clear breach of natural
      justice and the penalty imposed cannot stand.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the comments of Molloy J.  While the Law Society’s rules do say
    that the time frame can be abridged in the interests of justice, I do not

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Sections
    6 and 7 of the <i>SPPA</i> read, in part, as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>6(1)     The parties to a proceeding shall be given
    reasonable notice of the hearing by the tribunal.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3)       A notice of an oral hearing shall include,</p>

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>7(1)     Where notice of an oral hearing has been
    given to a party to a proceeding in accordance with this Act and the party

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Igbinosun
    had notice of a proceeding to deal with complaints of misconduct.  The notice
    did not say what jeopardy Igbinosun would face in the event of a finding
    of misconduct.  Nor did the notice say that in the event of a finding of
    guilt, the Law Society would proceed against him with respect to the penalty
    as well.  It was not reasonable for Igbinosun to expect that the penalty
    phase of the hearing would begin immediately after the liability phase.  As
    noted by Molloy J., even counsel for the Law Society was surprised that the
    penalty phase began so quickly.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>  Natural
    justice requires that reasonable notice of a proceeding be given to all parties
    to that proceeding.  This is not an onerous requirement.  As Molloy J. held,
    while the Law Society did give Igbinosun some notice of the penalty phase
    of the hearing, that notice was not reasonable.  This unreasonableness is
    further indicated by the fact that the Hearing Panel had to dispense with
    the Law Society’s own notice requirements regarding the disclosure of victim
    impact statements in order to hold the penalty hearing when it did.  </p>

    Divisional Court did not err in concluding that Igbinosun was entitled to
    reasonable notice and that he did not receive reasonable notice of the penalty
    phase of the hearing.  As indicated in s. 6(3) of the <i>SPPA</i>, notice
    of a hearing must include both the <i>purpose</i> of the hearing and a statement
    that a failure to attend the hearing may result in the hearing proceeding
    in the party’s absence.  The notice supplied to Igbinosun did not disclose
    that part of the purpose of the hearing was to determine Igbinosun’s punishment
    should he be found guilty.  The Hearing Panel erred in proceeding to the
    penalty phase as it did, as Igbinosun had not received proper notice of this
    aspect of the hearing, and thus could not have abandoned his right to participate

    Society Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. L.8, in the event that the rules of practice
    and procedure adopted by the Law Society conflict with the provisions of
    the <i>SPPA</i>, the rules adopted by the Law Society are to prevail.  Thus,

      in prejudice of a type that would warrant a stay of proceedings.  It held
      that any prejudice which Igbinosun suffered was offset by the public interest
      in having these serious matters addressed.  After making these findings,
      the Appeal Panel dismissed the appeal. </span></p>

      Panel’s refusal to grant a stay of proceedings on the ground of delay.  As
      noted by Molloy J., on Igbinosun’s appeal to the Appeal Panel, he did not
      allege any errors of law in the Hearing Panel’s decision denying the stay
      of proceedings because of delay.  He instead raised the issue of the refusal
      to stay the proceedings in the context of allegations of bias on the part
      of the Hearing Panel.  The Appeal Panel, at para. 80, found this to be
      an unacceptable collateral attack, but went on to address the merits of
      the issue anyway.  Molloy J. saw “considerable merit” in the Law Society’s
      argument that Igbinosun should not be permitted to raise the delay issue
      on appeal, since the right of appeal is only from decisions of the Appeal
      Panel (para. 71).  However, she observed that the Appeal Panel had
    “proceeded to consider the issue of delay on its merits” (para.72).  Molloy
    J. stated: “[i]t seems to me that since the Appeal Panel purported to rule
    on the issue of delay, even though it was not required to do so, it is open

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[76]     Even if I were to take the further step
    of considering the Hearing Panel’s Reasons on this point, in light of the
    Appeal Panel’s failure to do so, I would come to the same conclusion.  This
    was a close case, as is amply demonstrated by the compelling reasons of the
    Hearing Panel Chair in dissent.  However, I see no error in the reasoning
    of the majority of the Hearing Panel.  It considered the correct principles,
    weighed the relevant factors and exercised its discretion in favour of a
    determination of the complaints on their merits rather than dismissing for
    delay.  A rational case can be made for the opposite conclusion, again as
    is demonstrated by the dissenting Reasons.  However, it is not the function
    of this Court to choose which of the two sets of reasons it prefers.  The
    decision of the majority of the Hearing Panel was one of a reasonable range
    of options open to the Panel and, as such, is entitled to deference….</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[77]     …The Hearing Panel was not bound by the
    decision of the trial judge staying the criminal charges, nor was there any
    error by the Hearing Panel in failing to place any weight on the factual
    findings of the trial judge in that context.  The Hearing Panel was required
    to make its own findings of fact with respect to the issue of delay, based
    on the evidence before it and in the context of its own statutory obligations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, Molloy J. remitted the prosecution of the complaints to a new
    hearing panel to hear afresh.  She ruled that if Igbinosun chooses to pursue
    another stay application on the basis of delay, “the Hearing Panel is bound
    by the findings of the initial Hearing Panel with respect to the effects
    of the delay up to, but not after, February 27, 2006” (para. 81).</p>

    <st1:address

    Divisional Court on the issue of delay only, would have ordered a stay.  He
    referred to the reasons of Nadeau J. for staying the charges in the criminal
    proceedings against Igbinosun under s. 11(b) of the <i>Charter</i>,<i> </i>and
    his finding of prejudice, both inferred and actual, to the accused from the
    delay. Pitt J. went on to state, at paras. 91-92:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>[91]     This is a unique case in
      that there does not appear to be any case in which a related charge has
      been brought before an administrative Tribunal so long after a Superior
      Court stayed the criminal charge for delay having made a finding of significant
      prejudice. The granting of a stay in these circumstances would not represent
      the sort of ‘far reaching’
    modification of the common law that Cory J. referred to in <i>Hill</i>. </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>[92]     There is some evidence that
      the Law Society had a change of heart about closing the files shortly after
      the dismissal of the criminal charges, only after a lawyer representing
      the complainants in a civil matter contacted the Law Society about the
      civil proceedings.&nbsp;
    Contact with counsel in the civil litigation clearly seemed to have mitigated
    the Society’s well-documented concern about the legal implications of such
    long delay.</span></p>
  <p class=ParaNO>Pitt J. concluded: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[95]     I believe and I find that the Tribunal’s
    exercise of discretion in denying the stay on the grounds of delay was unreasonable.  I

    new hearing panel is bound by the previous panel’s findings on the effects
    of the delay for the period from 1999 to February 27, 2006, the date the
    hearing commenced.  Molloy J. was correct to find that the Appeal Panel should
    have reviewed the decision of the Hearing Panel on this matter, rather than
    engage in its own analysis.  Further, there is no reason to interfere with
    her conclusion on the merits, namely, that the Hearing Panel’s refusal to
    stay proceedings was correct. Accordingly, the only issue of any concern
    is the propriety of ordering a new hearing on liability and penalty, but
    binding the new hearing panel from addressing the effects of the delay in
    the proceedings from 1999 to February 27, 2006.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    134(1)(c) of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43, provides
    that in deciding an appeal, a court may “make any other order or decision
    that is considered just.”  As noted by the Appeal Panel, at para. 80, Igbinosun
    did not actually appeal from the Hearing Panel’s refusal to grant a stay
    of proceedings.  Instead, he attacked this ruling collaterally by claiming
    that the Hearing Panel was biased, and refused to grant the stay for this
    reason.  At the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court, Igbinosun appealed on the delay issue itself, and did not
    appeal from the Appeal Panel’s finding that there was no reasonable apprehension
    of bias in the Hearing Panel’s conduct or reasons. Indeed, the breaches of
    natural justice requiring a new hearing in this matter all occurred <i>after</i> the
    Hearing Panel’s refusal to grant a stay. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since
    Igbinosun never properly appealed the Hearing Panel’s finding on the delay
    issue to the Appeal Panel, there is no injustice in refusing to allow him
    to re-argue the matter in a new hearing.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> I
    would note that the order of Molloy J. does not preclude Igbinosun from bringing
    a new motion to stay proceedings on the basis of undue delay. Over three
    years have passed since the Hearing Panel refused to stay the proceedings
    against him.  Igbinosun may wish to argue that this <i>subsequent</i> delay,
    when considered in the context of the overall time frame, has resulted in
    prejudice to him sufficient to warrant a stay.  The effect of the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court’s order is simply to preclude Igbinosun from re-arguing
    that, at the time of the Hearing Panel’s ruling on the issue, a stay was
    warranted.  Of course, my observations on this matter should not be taken
    as expressing any position on the potential merits of any future stay application

lang=EN-US>On March 6, 2006, Igbinosun e-mailed Lawlor and asked him to advise
      the Hearing Panel that he (Lawlor) was not available to continue with the
      hearing until after June 30, 2006.  Lawlor responded that he could not
      tell the Hearing Panel this, because there were times in March, April and
      May when he was in fact available.  While the Law Society claims that this
      email demonstrates that Igbinosun was asking Lawlor to lie to the panel,
      the evidence does not safely permit such a conclusion.  Given that Lawlor
      has unavailable from April 22 – May 8, 2006, the entire month of June and
      a number of other individual dates, Igbinosun may have believed that Lawlor’s
      schedule precluded him from taking part in the hearing until July.  In
      any event, Lawlor’s availabilities prior to June ended up being moot.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>The reasons given by the Chair of the Panel were: 1) Igbinosun had
      three months notice of the date to which the hearing had been adjourned
      and the fact that he would be required to retain counsel or to represent
      himself; 2) he gave no evidence of taking any steps to retain new counsel;
      3) he had no realistic plan to retain counsel; 4) the history of delay
      and requests for adjournments; 5) a history of counsel getting off the
      record; and 6) he put forward no date to continue the hearing. </span></p>
