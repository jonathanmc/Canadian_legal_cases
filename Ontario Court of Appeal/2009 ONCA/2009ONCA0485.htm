    a three-day trial, the trial judge found the appellant guilty of sexual interference
    of a seven-year old girl. He was sentenced to 17 months in custody followed
    by 24 months of probation. The appellant appeals both his conviction and
    sentence. For the following reasons, I would dismiss both appeals.</p>

Year="2003" w:st="on">
    August 24, 2003, the complainant, a seven-year old girl, visited the house
    next door where the appellant lived. The appellant lived in the house along
    with his brother and sister-in-law, their 18-month old baby daughter and
    the sister-in-laws mother (the grandmother). The complainant and possibly
    some other neighbourhood children were at the house to play with the infant.
    The complainant had been there many times before.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant said that when the grandmother took the infant upstairs to change
    her diaper, she was alone with the appellant in the kitchen, where he pulled
    down her pants and underwear and while on his knees, he licked her privates. The
    complainant then pulled up her pants, told the appellant her mother was calling
    her, and went home. The trial judge found that the complainant told her mother
    of the incident at the first instance at which they were alone together.
    Her father immediately took her to the police station where she gave a statement.
    After her interview, at approximately
    <st1:time
Hour="22" Minute="0" w:st="on">
    10:00 p.m., the police seized her underwear, pants and t-shirt and eventually
    sent them to the Centre of Forensic Sciences. The complainant also went to
    Sick Childrens Hospital where a nurse took two external genital swabs and
    one buccal swab from the complainant for DNA testing. According to the report
    of the Centre of Forensic Sciences, those swabs were delivered by the police
    to the Centre for testing on
    <st1:date

    on the evening of
    <st1:date Month="8" Day="23"
Year="2003" w:st="on">
    August 23, 2003. When he knocked on the door, the appellants brother answered,
    and the appellant then came to the door. The officer and the appellant spoke
    on the driveway. The officer testified that after he arrested the appellant
    for sexual assault, read him his right to counsel and cautioned him, the
    appellant stated: My brother may know a lawyer. He also said he understood
    the caution and the advice about a legal aid lawyer. He then uttered the
    statements: I will talk to you, It was a joke<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>, and I shouldnt have kissed her. The appellant
    denied that he made these statements and testified that he did not know English
    and consequently did not understand what the officer had said to him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the station the appellant voluntarily gave a buccal swab of his saliva for
    DNA testing. Constable Rehan acted as an interpreter during the appellants
    interview at the police station, though he does not appear to have used the
    appellants first choice of language. Constable North testified that he was
    quite sure the appellant understood what was said to him in English at the
    police station, but admitted that the appellant appeared more comfortable
    speaking with the aid of the interpreter. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    a <i>voir dire</i>, the trial judge ruled that the appellant made the statements
    reported by Constable North, and that they were voluntary.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant testified. She was ten years old at the time of the trial. She
    had viewed her videotaped statement before testifying. The appellant testified
    at the trial as did his brother and the grandmother. The appellant denied
    the allegations. He said that he was never alone with the complainant. This
    was corroborated by the grandmother. Both witnesses testified through an
    interpreter.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown tendered into evidence, on consent, the report from the Centre of Forensic
    Sciences on the DNA testing. No witness testified regarding the report, except
    for Constable Blashuk, who interviewed the complainant at the police station
    on the night of the assault. In cross-examination, she answered that she
    was familiar with the report. Nor did any witness testify regarding the taking
    of the samples. The report concluded that only the complainants DNA was
    found on the external genitalia swabs. No DNA of any other person was found.
    Therefore, no comparison could be made with the DNA sample provided by the
    appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge viewed credibility as the central issue. She rejected the appellants
    evidence that he did not make the statements to the officer on arrest, that
    he did not speak English and did not understand the officer, that he was
    never alone with the complainant and that he did not do what the complainant
    alleged. Having accepted the evidence of Constable North and having found
    that the appellant made the statements as reported by the officer, the trial
    judge concluded that those statements were evidence of a guilty mind, implied
    sexual impropriety on the appellants part, and formed a significant factor
    in deciding the guilt of the appellant. She found that the statements were
    evidence that the appellant had committed a sexual act. She also rejected
    as untrue the corroborative evidence of the grandmother.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    defence relied at trial on the fact that only the complainants DNA was found
    on the external genital swabs that were taken that night. On that point the
    trial judge stated (para. 83):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Given the nature of the alleged assault, that is,
    kissing or licking the complainants privates for a brief time, common
    sense tells me that, many hours later, it is unlikely that there would be
    any foreign DNA left on the outer labia.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    concluded that the defence had not raised a reasonable doubt, the trial judge
    went on to consider whether the Crown had proved the charges beyond a reasonable
    doubt. She accepted the complainants evidence as reasonable and did not
    find any significant inconsistencies in her evidence. She concluded that
    the complainants testimony was accurate and truthful. In doing so, she also
    took into account that the seven-year old complainant had no motive to fabricate
    allegations of sexual impropriety against the appellant. The trial judge
    concluded that the Crown had proven the charges of sexual assault and sexual
    interference beyond a reasonable doubt. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ISSUES RAISED ON THE CONVICTION APPEAL </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant raises two issues on his appeal from conviction:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.Did the trial judge apply a disproportionate
    standard of scrutiny to the defence evidence, given by the grandmother and
    the appellant, as compared to the evidence of the complainant?</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2. Did the trial judge err by taking judicial notice
    of the properties of DNA?</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(a) The Defence Evidence</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge unreasonably rejected the evidence
    of the grandmother, who supported the appellant on the key point that he
    was not alone with the complainant. The grandmother also agreed with the
    appellant that there were other children there, in contrast to the complainant
    who said there were no other children. The presence of other children would
    have made it more difficult to commit the offence as alleged.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge rejected the grandmothers evidence. She found her evasive on
    how many children were in the home at the time and how many of them were
    girls. The trial judge identified this concern as a small point, but observed
    that admitting facts that are not significant is a hallmark of telling the
    truth. The trial judge found incredible the grandmothers testimony that
    over a two hour period while she was sitting in the living room there was
    no time when she could not see the appellant, except when he was in his room
    or in the shower. The trial judge also viewed negatively the answers to two
    single questions posed by the Crown: (1) the grandmother said she did not
    know about the appellants level of English comprehension; and (2) the grandmother
    agreed with the suggestion that she came to court to help the appellant. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>One
    could take a different view of these factors than did the trial judge. Without
    being there to observe the witness, one could view the answers given to single
    questions through an interpreter as less significant than the trial judge
    believed they were. However, unless the trial judge has misapprehended the
    evidence, the weight she decides to put on it is subject to deference when
    considered on appeal: <i>R. v. R.E.M., </i>2008 SCC 51, at paras. 54-57. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant also objects to the trial judges characterization of the appellants
    statements to the police officer. The trial judge viewed these statements
    as indicative of a guilty mind. The appellant submits that the statement, I
    shouldnt have kissed her, which at most indicates that he had kissed the
    complainant on some portion of her body, is not sufficiently precise when
    judged in relation to the very specific charges against him to be indicative
    of a guilty mind for sexual assault and sexual interference.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not accept this submission, for several reasons. First, in making the
    statement, I shouldnt have kissed her, to the police officer, the appellant
    could have been referring to kissing the complainants private parts. Second,
    the trial judge reasonably viewed that statement as undermining the appellants
    credibility, as his evidence at trial was that he had not touched the complainant
    at all, except to pat her on the head. Third, the trial judge appears to
    have taken the statements I shouldnt have kissed her and
    It was a joke, as attempts by the appellant to minimize the inappropriate
    acts he had engaged in with the complainant. This was a reasonable interpretation
    of the statements.  Fourth, as the trial judge said, the statements could
    be taken as an admission by the appellant that he had committed an inappropriate
    act. In her view, they indicated that the appellant knew he had done something
    wrong. The trial judge was entitled to draw the inferences she did from
    the appellants statements on the basis of the evidence before her, including
    the circumstances in which they were made. As highlighted by the trial judge,
    the statements were spontaneous and spoken immediately upon the appellants
    arrest. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that in contrast to her approach to the defence evidence,
    the trial judge failed to reconcile significant inconsistencies in the evidence
    of complainant. I do not agree. Most of the inconsistencies were insignificant.
    Furthermore, the trial judge was alive to the dynamics of the situation before
    her. She observed that while defence counsel was sensitive to the complainants
    young age, his questions were convoluted and could be confusing to a child.
    The trial judge carefully assessed the complainants evidence, found it reasonable
    and concluded that her story of the events made sense. Again, the trial judges
    view of the credibility of the complainant is entitled to the deference of
    this court.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(b) The DNA Evidence</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second issue raised on the appeal is the trial judges treatment of the DNA
    issue. The Crown had tendered on consent the report of the Centre of Forensic
    Sciences indicating that there was no DNA from the external genital swab
    taken from the complainant except her own. The defence wanted the trial judge
    to conclude that because the appellants DNA was not found by the genital
    swab, either the complainants story was not true or at least there was a
    reasonable doubt. Instead the trial judge applied common sense to conclude
    that many hours later, it is unlikely that there would be any foreign DNA
    left on the outer labia.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the appellant that the trial judge erred by drawing any conclusions
    regarding the ability of DNA to persist on skin. This is not a matter of
    common sense. Specialized scientific expertise is required to understand
    DNA and its characteristics: see <i>R. v. Terceira </i>(1998), 38 O.R. (3d)
    175 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), upheld in brief reasons by the Supreme Court of Canada in [1999] 3 S.C.R.
    866; <i>R. v. Paul </i>(2002), 62 O.R. (3d) 617 (
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ); and <i>R. v. Legere </i>(1994), 156 N.B.R. (2d) 321 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ). Courts in Canada require expert evidence to explain DNA and the significance
    of its presence or absence in respect of particular locations: see <i>R.
    v. Simon </i>2008 ONCA 578 for the use of expert evidence on DNA testing
    of saliva samples taken from vaginal swabs; and <i>R. v. Acorn, </i>2008
    CanLII 8615 (ON S.C.) and <i>R. v. Salehi, </i>2009 CanLII 2034 (ON S.C.)
    for the use of expert evidence in determining for how long sperm remains
    in the vaginal cavity for the purpose of DNA testing. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    issue of drawing conclusions based on common sense or judicial notice where
    expert evidence was required was recently addressed by this court. In <i>R
    .v. Perkins</i> <span
class=canliicitation>(2007), 223 C.C.C. (3d) 289,</span> Doherty J.A. restated
    the test from two Supreme Court of Canada cases, <i>R. v. Spence, </i><span class=canliicitation>[2005]
    3 S.C.R. 458,</span> at para. 53, and <i>R. v. Find, </i><span
class=canliicitation>[2001] 1 S.C.R. 863,</span> at para 48, for when judicial
    notice of an adjudicative fact may be taken. Judicial notice may be taken:
    (1) if the fact is so notorious and generally accepted as not to be the subject
    of debate among reasonable persons; or (2) if the fact is capable of immediate
    or accurate demonstration by resort to readily accessible sources of undisputed
    accuracy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>How
    long DNA deposited from saliva remains on the body is not a fact that is
    either notorious or capable of immediate demonstration. Expert evidence on
    DNA would have been required for the trial judge to draw the conclusion that
    she did. No such evidence was adduced. The trial judge erred in her conclusion
    in this regard.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    in this case, the error cannot be said to have affected the verdict. Although
    put into evidence by the Crown, the DNA analysis was relied on by the defence.
    The trial judge rejected the argument that the absence of the appellants
    DNA on the genital swabs taken from the complainant raised a reasonable doubt
    regarding his guilt. She did not, however, use her conclusion as part of
    the proof that the appellant committed the offence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    question therefore is, was the evidence, without any expert explanation,
    capable of raising a reasonable doubt? Technically, any evidence or lack
    of evidence may cause a trier of fact to have a reasonable doubt about the
    guilt of an accused. However, in this case, where no expert evidence was
    led to assist the court to understand whether one would expect to find DNA
    from saliva after several hours, it would have been mere speculation for
    the court to draw any conclusion based on the bare findings in the report
    that was filed. This evidence should not have been filed at the trial without
    expert explanation to assist the court with the use that could be made of
    it: see <i>R. v. Mohan</i>, [1994] 2 S.C.R. 9, at p. 23-24.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, therefore, this is an appropriate case to apply the curative proviso
    in s.&nbsp;686 (1) (b) (iii) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>. The proviso allows
    a conviction to be upheld even if the trial judge has erred, as long as the
    error has not resulted in a substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice.
    In its recent decision in <i>R. v. Van, </i>the Supreme Court discussed the
    criteria for the application of the proviso, at para. 34:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Crown bears the burden of showing the appellate
    court that the provision is applicable, and satisfying the court that the
    conviction should stand notwithstanding the error. To do so, it must establish
    that the error of law falls into one of two categories. First, that it is
    an error so harmless or minor that it could not have had any impact on the
    verdict. In the second category are serious errors that would otherwise justify
    a new trial or an acquittal, but for the fact that the evidence against the
    accused was so overwhelming that any other verdict would have been impossible
    to obtain: <i>R. v. Khan, </i>[2001] 3 S.C.R. 823, <i>R. v. Trochym, </i>[2007]
    1 S.C.R. 239.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    case falls into the first category. The case turned on credibility findings.
    The trial judge completely rejected the defence evidence as untrue and accepted
    the complainants evidence of what occurred. Had there been expert evidence
    suggesting that if the appellant had committed the offence, his DNA should
    have been found on an external genital swab from the complainant, that would
    have been very significant evidence in favour of the defence. However, there
    was no expert evidence at all on the point, making the findings in the DNA
    report either neutral or of no evidentiary value. Nor did the defence seek
    to tender any such expert evidence on appeal. On the state of the evidence
    presented to the court, the trial judges error could not reasonably have
    had an impact on the verdict. It did not cause any substantial wrong or miscarriage
    of justice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would therefore dismiss the appeal against conviction.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ISSUES RAISED ON THE SENTENCE APPEAL</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was sentenced to a reformatory term of 17 months followed by two
    years probation. The Crown had asked for a sentence in the range of 15-24
    months, while the defence sought a conditional sentence of less than six
    months. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge erred in principle by characterizing
    the circumstances in this case as a breach of trust. The trial judge considered
    this issue in detail in the context of the sentence submissions and her reasons.
    She acknowledged that the appellant was merely the next door neighbour of
    the complainant, that because the complainant had been at his house many
    times, they were not strangers, but that they did not have a relationship.
    The complainant referred to the appellant as uncle
    as a generic term.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the other hand, the complainant was a seven-year old girl visiting at the
    appellants house. He testified that he gave her and the other children popsicles.
    The trial judge noted that the appellant was a man the complainant should
    have been able to trust, and concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The niceties of the extent of the relationship
    of trust in my view [do] not have to be resolved. The Crown agreed it may
    be on the low-end of a relationship of trust, but there is still some relationship
    of trust there and I so find.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the trial judge was entitled to analyze the relationship, to conclude
    that it was at the low-end of a trust relationship, and to use that as an
    aggravating factor on sentence. The sentence imposed was within the range
    for this offence, even for a first offender. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would grant leave to appeal sentence, but dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>DISPOSITION</span></h4>

    leave to appeal sentence but dismiss the sentence appeal. </p>
