    Mongrain, the appellant, and Mark King, the respondent, have two children:
    Faith Erin King and Liam Thomas King.  Faith was born on February 27, 2006,
    and Liam was born on August 6, 2007.  Faith is currently three years old
    and Liam is not yet two.</p>

    five months after Faith was born, Ms. Mongrain moved to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Barrie to live with Mr. King in a home owned by him.  They separated on January
    26, 2008, but reconciled and resumed cohabitation in March or early April,
    2008.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    July 11, 2008, Ms. Mongrain left the home and took the children with her.  According
    to Ms. Mongrain, she fled to a women’s shelter because of continued violence
    at the respondent’s hands and his drinking.  According to both parties, she
    very quickly moved to
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Quebec where her family of origin has lived for many years.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    August 1, 2008, Mr. King started an application in the Superior Court of
    Justice.  He sought blood testing to determine Liam’s paternity, custody
    of Liam if he was the father, custody of Faith in any event, and child support.  By
    the time of the application, Ms. Mongrain had already moved to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Quebec.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    August 18, 2008, Ms. Mongrain started custody and access proceedings in the
    Quebec Superior Court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    King brought a summary judgment motion.  On September 25, 2008, Boswell J.
    issued an interim order requiring Ms. Mongrain to immediately return the
    children to the
    <st1:PlaceType

    27, 2008.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    October 15, 2008, in recognition of
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario’s jurisdiction over the children, the Quebec Superior Court upheld
    the order of Boswell J., dated September 25, 2008.  As a result, Ms. Mongrain
    was required to return the children to the Count of Simcoe and give Mr. King
    access to them.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
    of Ms. Mongrain’s ongoing breach of the court orders, on November 27, 2008,
    Boswell J. ordered that Mr. King would have interim custody of the children.  He
    gave Ms. Mongrain ten days in which to file responding materials to the summary
    judgment motion, “failing which [Mr. King] may proceed in default with a
    motion for uncontested trial.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Mongrain filed her responding materials within time.  However, she did not
    give the children to Mr. King.  In her responding materials, she states that
    after moving to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Quebec, she went to a police station and gave video statements of the assaults
    committed by Mr. King against her that she could remember most specifically.  In
    her affidavit, Ms. Mongrain describes several incidents of physical and verbal
    abuse.  She recalls having her head repeatedly driven into the headboard
    of the bed.  She also says that Mr. King once held a sledge hammer and told
    her that he would either hit her or the car in which she had intended to
    drive and pick up a friend.  Ms. Mongrain also says that after she spoke
    with another man while she was on a day-long boat excursion with Mr. King,
    Mr. King told her that if he ever caught her with another man he would kill
    the other man in front of her and then kill her.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    a result of the allegations, Mr. King was charged with a number of offences.  In
    the materials filed by Mr. King with the court on these proceedings, he states
    that he has retained counsel to defend the following criminal charges:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Assault – July 1, 2005, to July 31, 2005</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Assault – July 7, 2006</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Assault – April 1, 2007 to April 30, 2007</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Assault – March 20, 2007 to June 21, 2007</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Assault – September 1, 2007 to September 30, 2007</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Assault – December 1 to December 31, 2007</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Assault – June 29, 2008</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Assault with a weapon – October 15, 2007</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Utter threat. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    King describes the “majority of the charges” as
    “historical in nature”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Mongrain also deposed that: Mr. King has a drinking problem; she has cared
    for the children throughout their lives; and, in July 2008 when she left
    the home she shared with Mr. King, she had not worked for two years and no
    longer had a license to work as a nurse in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario.  She had no money and understood that she had no right to live in
    the home because she was not on title and was not married to Mr. King.  It
    was in that context that she left the women’s shelter and returned to
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Quebec.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Mongrain further deposed that during the parties’
    first separation, the Children’s Aid Society (“CAS”) had been involved.  At
    that time, CAS told her that she was not to let Mr. King have the children
    until an agreement had been reached and that the agreement was to include
    CAS as a party.  Access by Mr. King to the children during the separation
    had been resolved by means of a voluntary services agreement with the CAS.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    December 18, 2008, Ms. Mongrain was ordered to immediately deliver the children
    into Mr. King’s custody, failing which her answer would be struck and Mr.
    King could proceed to secure a final judgment by way of uncontested trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Still
    Ms. Mongrain did not comply and deliver the children.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    January 8, 2009, Ms. Mongrain attended court with two lawyers – her lawyer
    at the time, and Mr. Winnitoy, whom she wished to retain.  Mr. Winnitoy sought
    an adjournment to enable Ms. Mongrain to file further materials and undertook
    that if the adjournment was granted, he would go on record.  The adjournment
    request was refused since the motion judge had no confidence that Ms. Mongrain
    would comply with the prior orders.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two
    orders were made that day.  In the first order, on consent, counsel for Ms.
    Mongrain was removed from the record.  The first order also required Ms.
    Mongrain to deliver the children to Mr. King by 7:00 p.m. that day (the “first
    order”).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second order of January 8, 2009, is the subject matter of this appeal (the “Order”).  It
    struck Ms. Mongrain’s pleadings and made a final order giving sole custody
    of the children to Mr. King.  It gave Ms. Mongrain supervised access, or
    access as arranged in writing by the parties or their counsel, or as subsequently
    ordered by the court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    same day – January 8, 2009 – Ms. Mongrain delivered the children to Mr. King,
    as required by the terms of the first order.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Mongrain has been in flagrant disregard of court orders.  Her counsel candidly
    admits that she is wrong in this and does not attempt to excuse her refusal
    to comply with the court orders.  However, he argues that the motion judge
    erred in making a final custody and access order because it was done without
    considering the best interests of the children.  He also submits that the
    motion judge erred in striking Ms. Mongrain’s pleadings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree that the motion judge erred in making a final custody and access order.  Even
    if the appellant’s conduct justified an order striking her pleading, the
    respondent’s material did not provide a basis on which the motion judge,
    acting in accordance with the relevant statutory provisions, could determine
    that a final custody order in favour of the respondent was in the best interests
    of the children.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    24(1) of the <i>Children’s Law Reform Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.12 (the “Act”),
    makes it mandatory that custody and access be determined on the basis of
    the best interests of the child and in accordance with the criteria set out
    in ss. 23(2), (3) and (4).  Those subsections provide as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='color:windowtext'>(2)</span> The court shall consider all the child’s
    needs and circumstances, including,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) the love, affection and emotional ties between
    the child and,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i) each person entitled to or claiming custody
    of or access to the child,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii) other members of the child’s family who reside
    with the child, and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iii) persons involved in the child’s care and
    upbringing;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b) the child’s views and preferences, if they
    can reasonably be ascertained;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(c) the length of time the child has lived in a
    stable home environment;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(d) the ability and willingness of each person
    applying for custody of the child to provide the child with guidance and
    education, the necessaries of life and any special needs of the child;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(e) any plans proposed for the child’s care and
    upbringing;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(f) the permanence and stability of the family
    unit with which it is proposed that the child will live;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(g) the ability of each person applying for custody
    of or access to the child to act as a parent; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(h) the relationship by blood or through an adoption
    order between the child and each person who is a party to the application. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='color:windowtext'>(3)</span> A person’s past conduct shall be considered
    only,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a) in accordance with subsection (4);
    or</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b) if the court is satisfied that the conduct
    is otherwise relevant to the person’s ability to act as a parent. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='color:windowtext'>(4)</span> In assessing a person’s ability to act
    as a parent, the court shall consider whether the person has at any time
    committed violence or abuse against,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote> (a) his or her spouse;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b) a parent of the child to whom the application
    relates;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(c) a member of the person’s household;
    or</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(d) any child. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    his reasons, the motion judge said that he had considered the materials,
    including Ms. Mongrain’s responding material (even though it would be struck),
    and concluded that it would be just and appropriate to make a final order.  He
    then made the orders described above.  He said nothing else about custody
    or access.  No reference was made to the best interests of the children or
    to any of the s. 24 factors.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    King’s motion materials are completely bereft of information addressing the
    requirements in s. 24(2) of the Act.  His affidavits disclose the dates on
    which the parties cohabited, the criminal charges he faces in respect of
    the alleged acts of violence against Ms. Mongrain, some procedural aspects
    of this matter and some financial information about the parties.  He is a
    self-employed welder and has been self-employed since June 2002; Ms. Mongrain

    Barrie.  Mr. King has a close, loving relationship with the children.  Since
    separation in July 2008, he has been denied all contact with the children.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    my review of the criteria in s. 24(2) of the Act, at most, that information
    partially addresses the matters in clause s. 24(2)(a).  There is no information
    in Mr. King’s materials in relation to the balance of the criteria in s.
    24(2).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    Ms. Mongrain’s responding materials are considered, in accordance with s.
    24(3) and (4) the court was obliged to consider the alleged violence against
    her by Mr. King and whether that conduct was relevant to Mr. King’s parenting
    ability.  Ms. Mongrain’s materials also show that she has been the primary
    caregiver for these children since birth.  There is nothing to suggest that
    Ms. Mongrain is an unfit parent.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge had the power to strike the appellant’s pleadings due to her
    repeated refusals to obey court orders: see rule 14(23) of the <i>Family
    Law Rules</i>, O. Reg. 114/99.  I have every sympathy for the court which
    had given Ms. Mongrain a number of opportunities to participate, to be heard,
    and to assist in the proper resolution of this matter.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the same time, however, courts should use the utmost caution in striking
    pleadings where children’s interests are involved and it is generally preferable
    to avoid using that sanction: see, for example, <i>Haunert-Faga v. Faga </i>(2005),
    203 O.A.C. 388 (C.A.).  The reason for that admonition is simple – in order
    to make custody and access decisions in the best interests of the child,
    the court needs the participation of both parties.  Thus, while this court
    upheld the first instance decision to strike the pleadings of the husband
    in <i>Faga</i>, two things must be noted.  First, the pleadings were largely
    about financial matters, although there were limited parts on custody and
    access.  Second, and very significantly, as the court noted at para. 7 of
    its reasons, the Office of the Children’s Lawyer would represent the children’s
    interests in the proceedings.  Accordingly, the court was assured that the
    information necessary to make custody and access decisions in the children’s
    best interests would be before it.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Appellate
    courts are to give considerable deference to the decisions of trial judges
    on custody and access.  An appellate court is not to overturn a custody order
    in the absence of a material error, a serious misapprehension of the evidence
    or an error in law.  Deference is owed because trial judges, having heard
    the parties testify, are in the most advantageous position to determine the
    best interests of the child.  See <i>Van de Perre v. Edwards</i>, [2001]
    2 S.C.R. 1014 at paras. 11-12.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
    when a custody order is made on the basis of written and documentary evidence,
    deference is owed although the threshold for appellate intervention may not
    be as high because of the absence of oral testimony: <i>Snetzko v. Snetzko </i>(1996),
    23 R.F.L. (4th) 448 (Ont. Ct. J. (Gen. Div.)): <i>Bryant v. Hayes</i> (1997),
    151 Nfld. &amp; P.E.I.R. 261 (Nfld. C.A.), at para. 12.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    rationale for deference does not exist in the present case, as there was
    no trial and, if Ms. Mongrain’s evidence is struck, there is almost a complete
    absence of written evidence.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    any event, in my view, it is a material error to make a final custody order
    in the absence of evidence on virtually all of the factors listed in s. 24
    of the <i>Act.  </i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is not a situation in which an appellate court is attempting to substitute
    its view of the evidence or a different weighing of the factors –
    an appellate court is not entitled to overturn a custody order on that basis: <i>Coyle
    v. Danylkiw, </i>[2006] O.J. No. 2061 (C.A.).  If Ms. Mongrain’s pleadings
    are excluded from consideration, there was insufficient evidence before the
    motion judge on which to determine the issue of final custody of the children.  If
    Ms. Mongrain’s pleadings are included, the motion judge failed to weigh the
    s. 24 factors called into play by her evidence.  These are very young children
    who have spent all but the last few months in the full-time care of their
    mother.  Should Ms. Mongrain’s affidavit evidence prove true, it offers a
    reasonable basis for concern about her safety and that of the children.  There
    is no evidence that the children ever lived alone with Mr. King prior to
    Ms. Mongrain delivering them to him in January.  There are ongoing criminal
    proceedings relating to alleged acts of violence by Mr. King against Ms.
    Mongrain.  While an appellate court should not interfere in the weighing
    of relevant factors by a trial judge, intervention is required when the relevant
    factors have not been addressed, there is a paucity of evidence on those
    factors and that which does exist raises matters of serious concern for the
    children’s best interests.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    was some suggestion that the Order should be permitted to stand and Ms. Mongrain
    could bring a variation application should circumstances change.  Since I
    have concluded that the motion judge erred in striking Ms. Mongrain’s pleadings
    and awarding final custody to Mr. King, strictly speaking I need not address
    this issue.  However, it is worth noting that there would be a number of
    procedural and substantive disadvantages in proceeding in this fashion, rather
    than having the matter adjudicated on its merits.  If the matter returns
    to the family court in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Barrie and proceeds in the normal fashion, a first case conference will be
    held.  At that time, in addition to other things, a timetable will be set,
    the parties will be given parenting information, onsite mediation will be
    offered through the courts and steps will be taken to ensure that the requisite
    information to determine the best interests of the children will be before
    the court.  As the matters of custody and access will not have been finally
    determined, there is every incentive for both parties to co-operate fully
    in that process.  Mr. King would suffer no prejudice because the children
    now reside with him and the interim custody order of November 27, 2008, remains
    in effect. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> If,
    on the other hand, the Order stands and Ms. Mongrain must proceed by way
    of a variation application, the parties (and the children) would lose the
    benefit of the process established by the <i>Family Law Rules</i>.  Ms. Mongrain
    would bear the burden of proof of establishing a material change in circumstances
    as a threshold issue.  The court hearing the variation application would
    be required to assume that the Order is correct and could consider only the
    change in circumstances, if any, since the Order was issued: <i>Gordon v.
    Goertz</i>, [1996] 2 S.C.R. 27, at para. 11.  While there would never have
    been an adjudication on the merits on the matter of custody, the doctrine
    of <i>res judicata </i>may prevent Ms. Mongrain from re-litigating the matters
    dealt with in the Order.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>DISPOSITION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I would allow the appeal, set aside the Order, reinstate the appellant’s
    pleadings and order that the matter be remitted to the Family Court of the
    Superior Court of Justice at
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Barrie, on an expedited basis, for a determination of the issues of custody
    and access.  I would make no order as to costs of the appeal.</p>
