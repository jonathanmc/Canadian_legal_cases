  <h4><span lang=EN-US>A.        OVERVIEW</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    appeal raises the question whether a defendant in a negligence action can
    maintain a third party claim for contribution and indemnity against alleged
    joint tortfeasors, if the plaintiff has limited her claim to those damages
    attributable to the defendant’s degree of fault.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    plaintiff, Kathryn Taylor, began a class action in which she alleges that
    she suffered injuries as a result of the surgical implantation of a device
    in her jaw.  She claims that Health Canada’s negligent regulation of these
    devices caused her injuries.  She has sued only the Attorney General of
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    , which represents the Minister of Health and Health
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  After several amendments to her statement of claim, she now seeks from
    Health
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    only “those damages that are attributable to its proportionate degree of
    fault.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Attorney General, however, brought a third party claim against the dental
    surgeon (Dr. Dobrovolosky) who performed the implant surgery on Ms. Taylor
    and against the hospital (University Health Network) where the surgery took
    place.  The Attorney General alleges that these third parties may be liable
    for part or all of Ms. Taylor’s injuries.  He seeks contribution from them
    for their proportionate degrees of fault.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    third parties brought a motion under rule 21.01(1)(b) of the <i>Rules of
    Civil Procedure</i> to dismiss the third party claim on the ground that it
    discloses no reasonable cause of action.  Cullity J. granted the motion.  He
    held that in view of the amendment to the statement of claim “the exposure
    of the Crown is limited to damages for which it would have no right to contribution
    from any person who may have caused or contributed to the damages suffered
    by the plaintiff and any of the class members.”  The third party claim was
    thus “untenable.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Attorney General appeals on three grounds: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.         The plaintiff’s injuries are indivisible.  If
    the Attorney General cannot bring a third party claim, Health
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    may unfairly be held liable for the negligent acts of the doctor and the
    hospital.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2.         A court cannot apportion fault under
    the <i>Negligence Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. N.1, against a person who is not
    a party to the action.  If the third party claim is struck, Health
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    potentially may bear 100 per cent of the plaintiff’s damages.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>3.         Even if the motion judge was right to
    strike the third party claim, he erred by failing to order that the Attorney
    General is entitled to production of documents from and discovery of the
    proposed third parties.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, I would not give effect to the first two grounds
    of appeal.  On the third ground, whether production and discovery are required
    to prevent any unfairness to the Attorney General, this is a matter best
    addressed by the judge case managing the class action.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>B.        PROCEDURAL HISTORY</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>This
      litigation has had a protracted history.  Many of the details are unnecessary
      to decide this appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      brief, the action was begun in 1999.  Ms. Taylor claims that her injuries
      resulted from the insertion of a Vitek Propast Temporomandibular (TMJ)
      implant in her jaw.  She contends that Health Canada’s negligent regulation
      of TMJ implants caused her injuries.  She says either that Health Canada
      was negligent in even permitting these implants or that it was negligent
      in failing to properly regulate them.  Her claim has been certified as
      a national class action (except in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    British Columbia and
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Quebec).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      statement of claim has been amended several times.  In an amendment in
      2006, Ms. Taylor tried to preclude the Attorney General’s attempt to assert
      a third party claim by limiting her claim to the “several liability” of
      the Crown.  Still the Attorney General brought a third party claim against
      the doctor and the hospital.  In July 2007, a motion to strike the third
      party claim was dismissed by Cullity J. who found the 2006 amendment to
      be ambiguous.  In Cullity J.’s view, Ms. Taylor still seemed to be claiming
      that the Crown was liable for all the damages she had suffered from the
      implant.  Thus, the Attorney General had the right to seek contribution.  However,
      at para. 57 of his ruling, he commented on how the defendant’s right to
      contribution might be eliminated:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The difference between a claim
      that the defendant is liable for all the damages suffered by the plaintiff,
      and a claim that is limited to the part of the damages caused solely by
      the defendant is, I believe, critical.  While the latter cannot entitle
      the defendant to contribution, the former can if the plaintiff is unsuccessful
      in establishing that no other person’s negligence or fault was involved.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Cullity
      J. returned to this idea a few months later in his ruling on the certification
      motion:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>[88]
    … The possibility of third party claims will be obviated if the references
    to several liability of the Crown in the statement of claim are clarified
    in a manner referred to in the previous motion.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Ms.
      Taylor then amended her statement of claim again, as well as her reply,
      to incorporate Cullity J.’s suggestion.  Her current pleadings – her further
      fresh as amended statement of claim and her fresh as amended reply – expressly
      plead that her claim and the claim of each class member is limited to the “damages
      that would be apportioned to the defendant in accordance with the relative
      degree of fault that is attributable to the defendant’s negligence.”  These
      pleadings are the subject of this appeal.  The main amendments are contained
      in paras. 83 and 189 of the amended statement of claim and paras. 25 and
      81 of the amended reply:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>83.       The Plaintiff pleads
      that the injuries, damages and losses set out in the Statement of Claim
      were caused or contributed to by the negligence of Health
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>189.    The Plaintiff’s claim,
      and the claim of each Class Member, is limited to the amount of the Plaintiff’s
      or other Class Member’s damages that would be apportioned to the Defendant
      in accordance with the relative degree of fault that is attributable to
      the Defendant’s negligence.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>25.       The Plaintiff states
      and the fact is that the Defendant is liable in whole or in part for the
      damage to the Plaintiff and to the Class Members caused by the implantation
      of the Vitek TMJ implants, and the Plaintiff seeks on her own behalf and
      on behalf of the class those damages that would be apportioned to the Defendant
      in accordance with the relative degree of fault that is attributable to
      the Defendant’s negligence.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>81.
          The Plaintiff’s claim is against the Defendant for those damages that
    are attributable to its proportionate degree of fault, and she does not seek,
    on her own behalf or on behalf of the Class, any damages that are found to
    be attributable to the fault or negligence of any other person, or for which
    the Defendant could claim contribution or indemnity.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      Cullity J.’s view, which I share, these amendments made the Attorney General’s
      third party claim untenable.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>C.        ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>A
      motion to strike a pleading under rule 21.01(1)(b) will succeed only if
      it is
    “plain and obvious” that the pleading does not disclose a reasonable cause
    of action.  The Attorney General submits that the motion judge erred by holding
    that the third parties met this test.</span></p>
  <h3>1)        May Health
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    potentially be liable for the negligent acts of the doctor and hospital if
    the third party claim is struck?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Attorney General contends that unless he can maintain a third party claim,
    Health
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    may potentially be held liable for the negligent acts of the doctor and the
    hospital.  In support of this contention, the Attorney General relies on
    the point made in <i>Athey v. Leonati</i>, [1996] 3 S.C.R. 458, at para.
    25, that where a plaintiff’s injury is indivisible, any defendant who has
    negligently contributed to the injury will be fully liable for it.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    Ms. Taylor has not sued either the doctor or the hospital, the Attorney General
    says he is entitled to exercise his right under s. 5 of the <i>Negligence
    Act</i> to add them as third parties, and, by so doing, enable the court
    to apportion liability for the damages to Ms. Taylor and the other class
    members among all three potential tortfeasors.  He argues that this apportionment
    would allow the Attorney General to claim contribution for any portion of
    the plaintiff’s total loss not attributable to his negligence.  In my view,
    because of Ms.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Taylor’s circumscribed pleading, neither <i>Athey v. Leonati</i> nor s. 5
    of the <i>Negligence Act</i> applies here.  I can best show why this is so
    by an example.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Take
    a case where a plaintiff is injured and three tortfeasors, T1, T2 and T3,
    caused the injuries.  Assume that their respective degrees of fault are 20%,
    30% and 50%.  If the plaintiff sues only T1, then even though T1 is only
    20% at fault, as between it and the plaintiff, it will be liable for 100%
    of the plaintiff’s damages.  As Major J. said at para. 25 of <i>Athey v.
    Leonati</i>, any tortfeasor who caused a plaintiff’s injuries must fully
    compensate the plaintiff:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In the present case, there is a single indivisible
    injury, the disc herniation, so division is neither possible nor appropriate.  The
    disc herniation and its consequences are one injury, and any defendant found
    to have negligently caused or contributed to the injury will be fully liable
    for it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    limit the amount of its loss, T1 is entitled to exercise its statutory right
    to apportionment of fault by adding T2 and T3 as third parties under s. 5
    of the <i>Negligence Act</i>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Wherever it appears that a person not already a
    party to an action is or may be wholly or partly responsible for the damages
    claimed, such person may be added as a party defendant to the action upon
    terms as are considered just or may be made a third party to the action in
    the manner prescribed by the rules of court for adding third parties.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    court will apportion fault under s. 1 of the <i>Negligence Act</i>, so that
    among themselves, T1, T2 and T3 will indemnify each other in accordance with
    their respective degrees of fault:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Where damages have been caused or contributed to
    by the fault or neglect of two or more persons, the court shall determine
    the degree in which each of such persons is at fault or negligent, and, where
    two or more persons are found at fault or negligent, they are jointly and
    severally liable to the person suffering loss or damage for such fault or
    negligence, but as between themselves, in the absence of any contract express
    or implied, each is liable to make contribution and indemnify each other
    in the degree in which they are respectively found to be at fault or negligent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this example, T1 may still have to pay the plaintiff 100% of the plaintiff’s
    damages, but it can recover 80% of that amount from T2 and T3.  It has a
    right to contribution from T2 and T3 under the <i>Negligence Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    contribution rights arise only where a defendant is required to pay more
    than its proportionate share of a plaintiff’s damages.  In the present case,
    Ms. Taylor has limited her claim and those of the class members to those
    losses attributable to Health
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    ’s negligence.  In other words, she is not seeking all of her damages from
    Health
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    ; she seeks only the portion of her damages attributable to Health
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    ’s neglect and not the portion of her damages that may be attributable to
    the neglect of the doctor or the hospital.  In my example, if Health
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    is T1, in this action Ms. Taylor is seeking only 20% of her damages.  Because
    she is not seeking 100% of her damages, the full compensation principle articulated
    in <i>Athey v. Leonati</i> does not apply; equally, resort to s. 5 of the <i>Negligence
    Act</i> is unnecessary.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    decision of this court in <i>Holthaus v. Bank of Montreal</i> (2000), 131
    O.A.C. 119, is directly on point.  There, the plaintiff sued the Bank of
    Montreal and another for their role in the improper cancellation of some
    share certificates.  The plaintiff, however, limited its claim to those damages
    attributable to the Bank’s negligence.  Nonetheless, the Bank issued a third
    party claim against the securities dealer, RBC Dominion Securities Ltd.,
    for contribution and indemnity.  The motion judge struck out this third party
    claim and his decision was upheld by this court.  In its brief endorsement,
    this court said at para. 9:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>As the statement of claim is limited to the damages
    which can be attributed to the fault of the Bank, the Bank can have no claim-over
    against RBC with respect to these damages.  Sections 1, 2 or 5 of the <i>Negligence
    Act</i> do not assist the appellants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly,
    because Ms. Taylor has limited her claim to those damages attributable to
    Health
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    ’s fault, Health
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    can have no claim over against the doctor or the hospital for the damages
    claimed by Ms. Taylor and the other class members.  To ensure that Health
    Canada’s exposure is limited to the damages attributable to its fault, the
    court may have to apportion fault among the three potential tortfeasors:
    Health
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    , the doctor and the hospital.  The next question is whether the court is
    entitled to do so if neither the doctor nor the hospital is a party to the
    action.</p>
  <h3>2.         Can the court apportion fault against a person who is not a
    party to the action?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Attorney General submits that even if Ms. Taylor has limited her claim, the
    court has no jurisdiction to apportion fault against the doctor and the hospital
    unless they are parties to the action.  He relies on the judgment of this
    court in <i>Martin v. Listowel Memorial Hospital</i> (2000), 51 O.R. (3d)
    384 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) where, at para. 32, the court said that “there is no basis in s. 1 [of
    the <i>Negligence Act</i>] or anywhere in the Act for a judge to attribute
    a portion of fault to a non-party.”  The court repeated this limit on the
    judge’s jurisdiction when it discussed the effect of s. 1 at para. 48 of
    its reasons, a paragraph the Attorney General says is decisive of this appeal:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In our view, the effect of s. 1 of the Act is to
    define the legal effect of a finding of fault by concurrent wrongdoers.  The
    effect is to change the common law, and impose on concurrent wrongdoers joint
    and several liability to the plaintiff.  It is the only section of the Act
    which imposes liability, as opposed to apportioning fault.  The section is
    substantive, not procedural.  Therefore, when applying the section to any
    specific action, it is understood that joint and several liability to the
    plaintiff can and will attach only to a party defendant, although others
    who may also have been at fault could potentially have been found jointly
    and severally liable had they been sued by the plaintiff.  Because procedurally
    the section only affects defendants, under this section the court is to apportion
    degrees of fault only to defendants.  The court must also apportion fault
    to the other parties, the plaintiff and third parties, not under s. 1 of
    the Act but rather pursuant to ss. 3 and 4 of the Act, and in accordance
    with the requirements of the pleadings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not accept the Attorney General’s submission.  In my view, the excerpts
    from <i>Martin v. Listowel</i> to which I have referred are not dispositive
    of this appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    my colleague, Rosenberg J.A. observed in the later case of <i>Misko v. Doe</i> (2007),
    87 O.R. (3d) 517, at para. 20, these excerpts are <i>obiter</i> statements
    and therefore, strictly speaking, not a precedent binding on this court.  Indeed,
    in <i>Martin v. Listowel</i> itself, the court accepted the trial judge’s
    apportionment against two doctors who had been sued but had settled before
    trial, and therefore were not parties at the trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    the statement in <i>Martin v. Listowel </i>that a court has no jurisdiction
    to apportion fault against a non-party has been overtaken by later decisions
    of this court.  In different factual settings, this court held that a judge
    has jurisdiction under s. 1 of the <i>Negligence Act</i> to apportion fault
    against a person who is not a party to the action, and can exercise this
    jurisdiction in an appropriate case.  See <i>M.(J.) v. B.(W.)</i> (2004),
    O.R. (3d) 171 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), where Cronk J.A. discussed and distinguished <i>Martin v. Listowel</i>;
    and <i>Misko v. Doe</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    statutory interpretation and policy support the holdings in <i>B.(W.)</i> and <i>Misko</i>.  I
    think it noteworthy – although the panel in <i>Martin v. Listowel</i> did
    not – that s. 1 of the <i>Negligence Act</i> speaks of apportioning fault
    between “persons”, not between “parties.”  And s. 5 speaks of adding a “person” not
    already a party to the action.  As a matter of statutory interpretation it
    seems to me the Act itself recognizes that a court has jurisdiction to apportion
    fault against a person not a party to the action.  Put differently, nothing
    in the language of s. 1 precludes a court from doing so.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Interpreting
    s. 1 of the <i>Negligence Act</i> to permit a court to apportion fault against
    a non-party makes good sense.  Interpreting s. 1 in this way promotes the
    streamlining of litigation, as in the present case, and, as in other cases,
    the settlement of parts of the litigation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, this is an appropriate case for the court to determine whether to
    apportion fault against the doctor or the hospital, though neither is a party
    to the action.  Permitting apportionment without insisting that they be parties
    will mean fewer parties at trial, a shorter trial and reduced costs.  The
    remaining question is whether the Attorney General is entitled to procedural
    relief so he can pursue his claim to apportionment.</p>
  <h3>3.         Did the motion judge err by failing to order that the Attorney
    General is entitled to production of documents from a discovery of the proposed
    third parties?</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Attorney General submits that he cannot pursue his right to apportionment
    against the doctor and the hospital in a vacuum.  If neither is to be a party
    to the action then, he argues, he is at least entitled to production of documents
    from each of them and to examine each of them for discovery.  Otherwise he
    is prejudiced in his defence of the main claim.  He points to the order of
    Winkler J. in <i>Ontario New Home Warranty Program v. Chevron Chemical Co.</i> (1999),
    46 O.R. (3d) 130, as a sensible practical solution to rectify this unfairness. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the <i>Chevron Chemical</i> case, certain defendants had settled a class
    action for damages for negligently designed and manufactured products, and
    other defendants had not settled.  Because of the terms of the settlement
    agreement, which had to be approved by the court, Winkler J. precluded the
    non-settling defendants from taking third party proceedings for contribution
    from the settling defendants.  However, to protect the interests of the non-settling
    defendants in limiting their liability, he ordered that the settlement agreement
    be approved subject to the terms that the non-settling defendants could obtain
    from the settling defendants documentary and oral discovery, requests to
    admit, and an undertaking to produce a representative to testify at trial.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Attorney General’s request for procedural protection seems to have merit.  However,
    this request was not made to Cullity J. on the motion to strike the third
    party claim.  I therefore do not think we should address it on this appeal.  Instead,
    it is a proper matter to be considered by the judge case managing the class
    action.</p>

lang=EN-US>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Because
