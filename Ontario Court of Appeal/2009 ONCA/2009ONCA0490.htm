style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant was charged with nine offences.  Seven of the charges alleged various
    assaults against his domestic partner, Sherrie Woods.  One charge alleged
    a threat to kill Ms. Woods and one charge alleged a breach of recognizance
    based on the alleged assaults and threats.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant and Ms. Woods had been involved in an intermittent romantic relationship
    for many years.  Both have had very difficult lives.  The relationship had
    unfortunately become a violent one.  Each had assaulted the other on prior
    occasions. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    nine charges arose out of three incidents.  There was an alleged assault
    in July 2006 in which Ms. Woods claims she was struck with a rolling pin.  The
    Crown did not ultimately seek a conviction on this charge.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    second incident occurred sometime in late September or early October 2006.  Ms.
    Woods claimed that she wanted to leave the house, which she shared with the
    appellant, to do some painting.  He did not want her to go because he was
    not feeling well.  He picked up the dog dish and smashed her hand with it,
    significantly injuring one of her fingers.  This is referred to as the “dog
    dish”
    incident.  The trial judge convicted on this count.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    third incident occurred in November 2006 and involved a series of alleged
    assaults in various parts of the house.  Ms. Woods testified that the assaults
    began when the appellant threw a chair at her either grazing her head or
    narrowly missing her.  Subsequently, but on the same day, Ms. Woods testified
    that there were a number of other assaults involving a hammer and cigarette
    burns.  The trial judge convicted on the assault involving the chair.  This
    was referred to as the “wicker chair”
    incident.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for the appellant, in effective submissions, claims that considered in the
    context of the entirety of the evidence and the acquittals on the other counts,
    the two convictions are unreasonable.  She relies strongly on the trial judge’s
    finding that Ms. Woods’ evidence, for a variety of reasons, was incredible
    and unreliable.  Counsel submits that there was nothing in the evidence relating
    to the two charges on which the trial judge convicted that would justify
    distinguishing the verdicts on those counts from the acquittals on the other
    counts.  We agree with that submission and will address each count separately.</p>
  <h2>The “Wicker Chair” Incident</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    indicated above, this incident occurred in November 2006 on the same day
    and either immediately before or shortly before what Ms. Woods testified
    were a series of serious assaults perpetrated against her by the appellant.  The
    trial judge acquitted on all of those counts.  In our view, those acquittals
    render this conviction unreasonable for the following reasons.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    conviction and the acquittals arose out of what was essentially the same
    event.  Ms. Woods’ evidence in respect of the “wicker chair” incident was
    as inconsistent and confusing as was her evidence in relation to the other
    allegations.  There was no confirmatory evidence in respect of the “wicker
    chair” incident.  The serious concerns with respect to Ms. Woods’ credibility,
    in particular her prior perjury and her proven motive to falsely accuse the
    appellant, applied to this charge as much as they applied to the other charges.  Finally,
    with respect to the trial judge, he offered no real explanation for distinguishing
    between the verdict in respect of the “wicker chair” incident and his verdicts
    on the other charges arising out of the November incident.  The conviction
    arising out of the “wicker chair” incident is unreasonable and must be quashed.</p>
  <h2>The “Dog Dish” Incident</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    convicting on this count, the trial judge relied on the evidence of Ms. Woods’ family
    doctor.  Ms. Woods had visited the doctor shortly after the alleged incident.  She
    had an injury to her finger that was not inconsistent with her allegation
    that the appellant had smashed her hand with the dog dish.  The trial judge
    in convicting on this count noted:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I accept the evidence of Dr. Levasseur that such
    injuries would not likely have been caused by the complainant as part of
    any self-harming behaviour.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>That
    opinion, assuming it was an opinion that the doctor was entitled to give,
    could not support the inference that the appellant was in any way implicated
    in the injury.  It went no further than to indicate that Ms. Woods would
    not have intentionally injured her hand in that way.  It did not, and could
    not preclude an accidental self-inflicted injury.  In our view, the doctor’s
    opinion as to the cause of the injury to Ms. Woods’ hand did not provide
    independent evidence confirming Ms. Woods’ allegation that the appellant
    hit her with the dog dish.  Ms. Woods’ evidence in respect of the “dog dish” incident
    was infected by all of the same credibility problems that were evident in
    the rest of her testimony.  We think this verdict was also unreasonable.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appeal is allowed, the convictions are quashed and acquittals are substituted.</p>
