    appellants are former employees of Catelectric-Dip Corporation (“Cat-Dip”).  Their
    employment was terminated on December 19, 2003, shortly before Cat-Dip went
    into bankruptcy on January 19, 2004.  They did not receive the severance
    and termination pay to which they were entitled under the <i>Employment Standards
    Act, 2000</i>, S.O. 2000, c.&nbsp; 41 (the “ESA”).  They appeal from the

  <h4 style='line-height:200%'><span style='font-style:normal'>II.        FACTS</span></h4>
  <h3><i>The purchase of Cat-Dip and the financing arrangement </i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Cat-Dip,
    an electroplating company, was originally owned by a division of Decoma International
    (“Decoma”), a member of the Magna family of automotive companies.  It had
    about 150 full-time permanent employees.  In March 2002, David Lund bought
    Cat-Dip from Decoma.  He was already the owner of another electroplating
    company, Novaquest Finishing Inc. (“Novaquest”).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the time of the Cat-Dip purchase, Mr. Lund incorporated a holding company,
    4064186 Canada Inc. (“406”), to hold all the shares of Cat-Dip and Novaquest.  Mr.
    Lund held all the shares of 406.  The Board accepted Mr. Lund’s testimony
    that this arrangement came about largely at the request of his and Novaquest’s
    banker, the Bank of Montreal (“BMO”).  BMO established all of its financial
    arrangements with 406.  BMO extended credit facilities to 406, the holding
    company, secured by all of the assets and receivables of Novaquest and Cat-Dip,
    the operating companies.  Each day, 406 “scooped” all of the money deposited
    in Novaquest and Cat-Dip and, in turn, provided all of their necessary operating
    funds.  BMO was not concerned with the performance of Cat-Dip in isolation.  Instead,
    BMO was concerned about whether 406 was meeting the covenants established
    as part of the financing arrangement and whether the operating companies
    were performing in a manner which ensured that BMO’s security was adequately
    protected.</p>
  <h3><i>Cat-Dip’s business problems leading up to bankruptcy</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    2003, Cat-Dip began to experience business problems after losing some of
    its key customers.  One of the primary reasons for its difficulties in maintaining
    profitability was that its employees’ wages were approximately 25% – 30%
    higher than at Novaquest.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    September 2003, BMO advised 406 that it was $1.6 million “out of margin” and
    was borrowing in excess of the ratio of receivables it had covenanted to
    maintain.  BMO refused to provide any more money and expected 406 to return
    quickly to margin.  Further, BMO moved the 406/Novaquest/Cat-Dip financial
    situation to its “special accounts department” and counselled Mr. Lund to
    hire more sophisticated financial advice. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Mr.
    Lund hired Mr.  Reid, a Chartered Accountant, as the Chief Financial Officer
    for 406 in September 2003.  At the time he was hired, 406 did not have enough
    funds available to meet the next payroll for the employees of Novaquest and
    Cat-Dip.  Mr. Reid testified that the financial problems were serious.  That
    same month, Cat-Dip lost one of its larger key customers and temporarily
    laid off 28 employees.  In November 2003, BMO retained Richter and Partners
    (“Richter”) to monitor the group of companies. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    BMO refused to advance any further funds, Mr. Lund borrowed approximately
    $2.5 million from family members in September and October 2003 in exchange
    for promissory notes.  Although the loans were intended to allow Cat-Dip
    to continue operating, they were made to Novaquest and secured by Novaquest’s
    assets.  The funds were then moved into the accounts of 406 and used to defray
    Cat-Dip’s operating costs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the fall of 2003, Mr. Lund and Mr. Reid made concerted efforts to locate
    new customers for Cat-Dip and to streamline the company’s operations.  However,
    despite those efforts, Cat-Dip continued to lose money.  Mr. Lund and Mr.
    Reid held discussions with Richter about the options available for Cat-Dip.  They
    ultimately retained Richter as the Trustee in Bankruptcy to advise them on
    the possibility of making a proposal to creditors under the <i>Bankruptcy
    and Insolvency Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 (the “BIA”).  Richter recommended
    offering $195,000 to unsecured creditors, which amounted to approximately
    ten cents on the dollar.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    December 19, 2003, Cat-Dip sent notices to all its employees advising them
    that their employment had either been terminated or that their employment
    could continue at a lower wage rate.  In total, approximately 100 employees
    lost their employment that day.  Many of these employees had worked for Cat-Dip
    for a long time, some as long as 20 years.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    termination triggered the termination and severance pay provisions of the
    ESA.  Terminated employees were entitled to termination pay of one week’s
    wages for each year of service to a maximum of eight weeks and to severance
    pay of one week’s wages for every year of service.</p>
  <h3><i>Cat-Dip’s bankruptcy and the launch of Catelectric Inc.</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    December 29, 2003, Cat-Dip filed a proposal under the BIA.  The primary unsecured
    liability of Cat-Dip was its debt to terminated employees.  On January 19,
    2004, a meeting of creditors was held.  The unsecured creditors were offered
    approximately 12 cents on the dollar.  Richter advised that if the proposal
    was rejected, the unsecured creditors would receive nothing because BMO’s
    secured claims against Cat-Dip far exceeded the value of Cat-Dip’s assets.  Despite
    Richter’s advice, the majority of the creditors, made up of the employees,
    voted against the proposal.  As a consequence of the rejection of the proposal,
    Cat-Dip went into bankruptcy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Richter,
    the Receiver and Trustee in Bankruptcy, intended either to shut down Cat-Dip
    temporarily or to liquidate it immediately.  A few hours after Cat-Dip went
    into bankruptcy, Mr. Lund incorporated a new company, Catelectric Inc. (“Catelectric”),
    and obtained $1,775,000 in financing; the funds were drawn in part from his
    own assets and loans from his family.  He then purchased the assets of Cat-Dip
    at their appraised value, which was considerably less than the amount of
    BMO’s outstanding secured debt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Catelectric
    began to operate immediately.  In fact, the Cat-Dip employees who remained
    with Catelectric did not even cease working.  They continued to work at the
    same location, on the same machines, and on the same projects, for Catelectric.</p>
  <h3><i>Cat-Dip employees’ claims and the decision of the Employment Standards
      Officer</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Several
    of the employees terminated by Cat-Dip filed claims with the Employment Standards
    Branch of the Ministry of Labour for their termination and severance pay,
    alleging that Novaquest, 406, and Catelectric were related employers within
    the meaning of s. 4 of the ESA.  An employment standards officer determined
    that $983,942.68 was owed to these employees and that Novaquest, 406, and
    Catelectric were jointly and severally liable as related employers to Cat-Dip
    under s. 4 of the ESA.  Orders to pay were therefore made against the three
    companies.  The three companies then filed applications with the OLRB for
    review of the orders to pay.</p>
  <h3><i>Review of the employment standards officer’s decision by the Board</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the applications to review the order of the employment standards officer,
    the Board’s task was to determine whether Novaquest, 406, and Catelectric
    were related employers within s. 4 of the ESA.  Section 4(1) of the ESA provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Subsection (2) applies if,</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a) associated or related activities or businesses
    are or were carried on by or through an employer and one or more other persons;
    and</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(b) the intent or effect of their doing so
    is or has been to directly or indirectly defeat the intent and purpose of
    this Act.</p>

    4(2) of the ESA provides that the employer and the other person or persons
    described in subsection (1) shall be treated as one employer for the purposes

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    4(5) of the ESA states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Persons who are treated as one employer under this

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    its decision dated October 26, 2005, the Board found that Novaquest, 406,
    Catelectric, and Cat-Dip were related businesses for the purpose of s. 4(1)(a)
    of the ESA, because of their common management, ownership, and financial
    control.  In its second decision dated April 27, 2006, the Board found that
    the criteria set out in s. 4(1)(b) had not been met.  According to the Board,
    there was neither an “intent” to defeat nor an “effect”
    of defeating the intent and purpose of the ESA  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    reaching this conclusion, the Board focused on the following: the circumstances
    surrounding the acquisition of Cat-Dip; how it related to the other companies
    owned by Mr. Lund; how Mr. Lund reacted to its financial problems; and, how,
    after its bankruptcy, Mr. Lund came into possession of the Cat-Dip assets,
    enabling him to establish the “phoenix company”, Catelectric.  The Board
    rejected the argument that s. 4 is “simply a deep pockets provision that
    requires only a finding of relatedness between a company that can meet its
    employment standards obligations and a company that cannot”.  It went on
    to observe that the fact that one related company is solvent and the other
    insolvent is not, on its own, an “effect”
    that defeats the intent or purpose of the ESA; there must be a connection
    between the “relatedness” and the insolvency.  The Board concluded that there
    was no evidence in this case that the insolvency of Cat-Dip was caused or
    affected by its relationship with 406 and Novaquest.  To the contrary, the
    Board concluded:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Cat-Dip was propped up by the revenues and financial
    strength of Novaquest, which, in turn, allowed 406 to maintain the lending
    relationship with the Bank that supported Cat-Dip’s mounting losses.  Without
    Novaquest and 406, Cat-Dip would have failed earlier and without the ability
    to meet its employment standards obligations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Therefore,
    the Board held that Novaquest, 406, and Cat-Dip should not be treated as
    one employer under s. 4(2) of the ESA.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Turning
    to Cat-Dip and Catelectric, the Board concluded that there was no evidence
    that any action taken in respect to Catelectric had an effect on the ESA
    entitlements of the Cat-Dip employees.  It found that the rejection of the
    proposal in bankruptcy created the opportunity for Mr. Lund to acquire Cat-Dip’s
    assets from BMO.  The launch of Catelectric, a “phoenix”
    company, did not have any “effect” on Cat-Dip’s ability to meet its ESA obligations
    to the terminated employees.  Cat-Dip had gone bankrupt and the employees’ entitlements
    to termination and severance pay were not going to be made in any event.
    Mr. Lund’s choice to purchase the assets of Cat-Dip and use them to start
    Catelectric Inc. did not have an
    “effect” on Cat-Dip’s abilities to pay the employees.  The Board therefore
    held that Cat-Dip and Catelectric should not be treated as one employer under
    s. 4(2) of the ESA.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is worth reiterating that the appellants do not attack the Board’s findings
    of fact. Instead, they advance a strictly legal argument.  They accept that
    the
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court could not have interfered with the Board’s decision unless
    it found that decision to be unreasonable.  They submit that this court should

    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court only if it determines that the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court applied the wrong law, misinterpreted the law, or was otherwise
    incorrect in its assessment and/or conclusion.  The appellants advance a
    two-pronged argument in submitting that the
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court erred in upholding the decision of the Board as reasonable. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    they assert that the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court failed to articulate the
    “correct” interpretation of s. 4 of the ESA<i> </i>before conducting its
    review of the Board’s decision to determine whether it was reasonable.  According
    to the appellants, the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court’s approach is contrary to the very purpose of judicial review.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the appellants submit that, generally, in order for a decision to be reasonable,
    it must accord with the purpose and intent of the governing statute.  According
    to the appellants, the Supreme Court of Canada has established specific principles
    to guide the interpretation of employment standards legislation; these principles
    require that the Board reach decisions that fulfill the underlying remedial
    purpose of the ESA, namely, to protect employees’ entitlements.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants submit that the purpose of s. 4 of the ESA<i> </i>is to ensure
    that employees receive the severance and termination pay to which they are
    entitled even when their employer is unable to meet its obligations.  While
    the appellants do not contest the Board’s finding of fact there was no intent
    to defeat the ESA, they submit that the question of whether there was such
    an “effect” is a matter of legal construction.  They submit that the Board
    failed to interpret the word “effect” in a manner consistent with the clear
    and overarching legislative purpose of the ESA, generally, and s. 4, specifically.  According
    to the appellants, the “effect” component of s. 4 is satisfied whenever the
    result or “effect” of not treating related employers as one employer is that
    employees lose their entitlements to severance and termination pay.  </p>
  <h4>Position of the Director of Employment Standards</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Director of Employment Standards (the “Director”) asserts that there are
    two divergent and conflicting lines of decisions of the OLRB in relation
    to the interpretation of s. 4 of the ESA – a narrow line and a broad line.  The
    Director submits that the narrow line of decisions, which it asserts the
    Board applied in this case, is unreasonable.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Director’s argument that the “broad” line of authority is correct parallels
    the second prong of the appellants’ argument.  Like the appellants, the Director
    stresses that the ESA<i> </i>is remedial public welfare legislation designed
    to ensure minimum employment standards for a vulnerable class of non-unionized
    workers in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario.  In particular, the “related employer”
    provisions of s. 4 are intended to expand who is liable as the “employer” for
    employees’ entitlements to wages under the ESA without regard to corporate
    form.  According to the Director, the narrow line of authority is unreasonable
    because it is wholly inconsistent with the approach to the interpretation
    of employment standards legislation mandated by the Supreme Court of Canada.  The
    Director argues that the Board applied an unreasonable line of authority
    and made an unreasonable decision.  A decision that applies an unreasonable
    line of authority cannot be reasonable.</p>
  <h4>Position of the OLRB</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    OLRB quite properly did not take a position on the merits of the appeal.  It
    restricted itself to making submissions on the standard of review and related
    issues.  The OLRB has a statutory duty under s. 116 of the ESA to hear and
    determine applications for review of decisions of employment standards officers.  When
    reviewing the decisions of employment standards officers, the OLRB essentially
    conducts a hearing <i>de novo</i>.  As set out in s. 119(6) of the ESA:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Board may, with necessary modifications, exercise
    the powers conferred on an employment standards officer under this Act and
    may substitute its findings for those of the officer who issued the order
    or refused to issue the order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under
    section 119(7), the OLRB may amend, rescind, or affirm any order made, issue
    a new order, or affirm the refusal to make an order.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    a decision of the OLRB is shielded from unrestrained judicial review by the
    privative clause in s. 119(13):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A decision of the Board is final and binding upon
    the parties to the review and any other parties that the Board may specify.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>The OLRB asserts that the protection of this privative clause
    strongly suggests that reasonableness is the appropriate standard for review
    of a decision of the OLRB.  The OLRB places special emphasis on s. 119(14),
    which states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Nothing in subsection (13) prevents the court from
    reviewing the decision of the Board under this section, but a decision of
    the Board concerning the interpretation of this Act shall not be overturned
    unless the decision is unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>This subsection expressly precludes the review on a standard
    of correctness of a decision of the OLRB concerning the interpretation of
    the ESA.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    OLRB submits that the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court quite properly declined to articulate a “correct” interpretation
    of s. 4 of the ESA<i> </i>prior to conducting its reasonableness review.
    On judicial review, the court’s role is simply to determine whether the OLRB’s
    interpretation was reasonable.  If so, then the court should not interfere
    with its decision, even if other reasonable interpretations exist.  The OLRB
    says that the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court was not required to resolve any conflict between two allegedly
    conflicting lines of decisions interpreting s. 4 of the ESA.  According to
    the OLRB, “the existence of conflicting lines of cases is a natural and acceptable
    consequence of the deference that courts properly afford expert tribunals.”</p>
  <h4>Position of the respondent companies</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent companies submit that given the plain words of s. 119(14) of the
    ESA, a reviewing court cannot overturn a decision of the OLRB unless it is
    unreasonable.  The respondent companies go so far as to argue that even if
    the Divisional Court regarded the Board’s decision as wrong, it was obliged
    to uphold it if the decision was reasonable.  They submit that a Board decision
    cannot be found to be unreasonable unless there is no line of analysis in
    its reasons that could reasonably lead the tribunal from the evidence to
    its conclusion.  According to the respondent companies, the Board applied
    a clear and reasoned approach, consistent with prior jurisprudence of the
    OLRB and
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court, and arrived at a reasonable conclusion. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent companies criticize the appellants’
    suggested approach to the interpretation of s. 4 as an attempt to impose
    a scheme of absolute liability on related employers.  More importantly, they
    say that the appellants’
    liability approach to the related employer provision would deprive s. 4(1)(b)
    of all meaning and render it superfluous.  By contrast, they submit that
    the Board’s application of s. 4(1) was a reasoned balancing of interests
    that gave meaning to all the words of the provision.</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    summarized above, the appellants argue that the
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court erred in concluding that the Board’s interpretation and
    application of s. 4 of the ESA<i> </i>was reasonable without first determining
    the correct interpretation of the section.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    premise of the appellants’ argument is that judicial review on the standard
    of reasonableness allows the Board a margin of error.  The
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court’s function on judicial review, as conceived by the appellants,
    is to measure the extent to which the Board’s decision departs from the correct
    one.  If the Board’s departure from the correct decision is within a reasonable
    margin of error, the standard of review prevents the court from overturning
    it.  According to the appellants, in this case, the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court was not in a position to measure the extent to which the
    Board’s decision deviated from the correct one because the court never considered
    first what the correct decision would be.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent companies’ argument that a Board decision that is “wrong” might
    still be upheld is also premised on the view that judicial review on the
    standard of reasonableness allows the tribunal a margin of error to deviate
    from the correct decision.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Regarding
    judicial review on a standard of reasonableness as the determination of whether
    a tribunal’s decision deviates from the correct decision by more than a reasonable
    margin of error is a grave misconception.  Judicial review on a standard
    of reasonableness recognizes there is no single outcome that must be regarded
    as the correct one.  Rather, there is a range of outcomes that are acceptable
    and the function of judicial review on a standard of reasonableness is merely
    to determine whether the decision falls within that range.  The Supreme Court
    of Canada has explained this repeatedly. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Law
      Society of New Brunswick v. Ryan</i>, [2003] 1 S.C.R. 247, which was relied
      upon by the Divisional Court, the Supreme Court made clear at para. 50
      that a reviewing court should not ask itself what the correct decision
      would be:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>At the outset it is helpful to contrast judicial
    review according to the standard of reasonableness with the fundamentally
    different process of reviewing a decision for correctness. When undertaking
    a correctness review, the court may undertake its own reasoning process to
    arrive at the result it judges correct. In contrast, <i>when deciding whether
    an administrative action was unreasonable, a court should not at any point
    ask itself what the correct decision would have been</i>. Applying the standard
    of reasonableness gives effect to the legislative intention that a specialized
    body will have the primary responsibility of deciding the issue according
    to its own process and for its own reasons. <i>The standard of reasonableness
    does not imply that a decision-maker is merely afforded a “margin of error” around
    what the court believes is the correct result</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>

    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address

    Divisional Court’s decision in this case, the Court stated at para. 47:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[C]ertain questions that come before administrative
    tribunals do not lend themselves to one specific, particular result. Instead,
    they may give rise to a number of possible, reasonable conclusions. Tribunals
    have a margin of appreciation within the range of acceptable and rational
    solutions. A court conducting a review for reasonableness inquires into the
    qualities that make a decision reasonable, referring both to the process
    of articulating the reasons and to outcomes. In judicial review, reasonableness
    is concerned mostly with the existence of justification, transparency and
    intelligibility within the decision-making process. But it is also concerned
    with whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes
    which are defensible in respect of the facts and law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    court then summarized judicial deference in the context of the reasonableness
    standard, at para. 49:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In short, deference requires respect for the legislative
    choices to leave some matters in the hands of administrative decision makers,
    for the processes and determinations that draw on particular expertise and
    experiences, and for the different roles of the courts and administrative
    bodies within the Canadian constitutional system.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the present case, s. 119(14) of the ESA is a statutory instruction of the
    legislature to the courts to leave the primary responsibility for the interpretation
    of the ESA<i> </i>to the OLRB, a specialized expert tribunal.  The legislature
    has mandated that the courts not overturn a decision of the OLRB concerning
    the interpretation of the ESA<i> </i>unless it is unreasonable. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    legislative scheme, which stipulates judicial review on the standard of reasonableness,
    precluded the Divisional Court from determining what, in its view, would
    be the correct interpretation of s. 4 of the ESA in its review of the Board’s
    decision.  I therefore do not accept the appellants’
    argument that the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">

    Divisional Court erred in failing to articulate first what in its view would

  <h3>2.  <i>There are no conflicting lines of authority in the OLRB’s jurisprudence</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Director’s submission that a special approach to judicial review on the reasonableness
    standard is required where the administrative tribunal has developed two
    conflicting lines of authority concerning the interpretation of its governing
    statute is, at first blush, appealing.  From a common sense perspective,
    it is difficult to accept that two truly contradictory interpretations of
    the same statutory provision can both be upheld as reasonable.  If two interpretations
    of the same statutory provision are truly contradictory, it is difficult
    to envisage that they both would fall within the range of acceptable outcomes.  More
    importantly, it seems incompatible with the rule of law that two contradictory
    interpretations of the same provision of a public statute, by which citizens
    order their lives, could both be accepted as reasonable. In such circumstances,
    the Director suggests, the reviewing court must consider both competing lines
    of authority and decide which one is reasonable. The Director’s position,
    though perhaps unorthodox, is worthy of consideration.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    considering the Director’s argument, however, it is worth commenting on the
    Director’s posture before the court.  Section 116(7) of the ESA<i> </i>gives
    the Director party status before the OLRB.  The role the Director should
    play as a party was not an issue before the Board, the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court, or this court.  The Director explained in its factum that
    it appears at proceedings of the OLRB and in court to ensure both that the
    ESA<i> </i>is interpreted in a manner that furthers its broad purpose and
    that it is consistently applied and enforced.  In other words, the Director
    appears as an advocate of its view of the proper interpretation of the ESA.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Director submits that this case, as well as several other decisions of the
    OLRB and of employment standards Referees applying s. 4 of the ESA where
    the employer had become insolvent, were wrongly decided.  They were wrongly
    decided, according to the Director, because they required evidence of some
    connection between the corporate relationship and the insolvency, and a finding
    that the employees’
    rights were defeated by something other than the insolvency.  This, the Director
    submits, is an overly restrictive approach to the interpretation of the “effect” component
    of s. 4(1)(b) of the ESA.  The Director cites cases dating back to 1990 in
    support of its submission. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the Director cannot include cases dating back to 1990 in the analysis.  Significant
    changes have been made in employment standards legislation and procedure
    since then.  First, the power to review orders of employment standards officers
    was transferred from Referees of the Office of Adjudication of the Employment
    Standards Branch to the OLRB by a legislative amendment in 1998.  Second,
    the ESA<i> </i>was substantially rewritten in 2000.  Specifically, s. 119(14)
    was added to the ESA<i> </i>as part of the 2000 amendments and the OLRB’s
    mandate to interpret the ESA<i> </i>was established legislatively.  Third,
    the related employer provision of the ESA<i> </i>was amended in 2000.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    appreciate that the decisions of employment standards Referees, although
    not protected by a privative clause, were reviewed on the pre-<i>Dunsmuir </i>standard
    of reasonableness.  I also note the Director’s submission that s. 4 of the
    present ESA<i> </i>is intended simply to be a more readable and comprehensible
    restatement of s. 12 of the now repealed <i>Employment Standards Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. E. 14 (although whether that is so is a question to be entertained
    by the body primarily responsible for the interpretation of the legislation).  What
    I consider important is that only since the addition to the ESA of s. 119(14)
    can it be said that the legislature specifically assigned the primary role
    of interpreting the statute to the OLRB.  The decisions of Referees interpreting
    earlier versions of the related employer provision in the predecessor statute
    simply cannot be used to support the contention that the OLRB has failed
    to interpret the current version of the statute in a consistent manner. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    review of the OLRB’s decisions regarding the interpretation of s. 4 of the
    current ESA does not support the Director’s submission that there are two
    divergent and conflicting lines of authority.  Some of the OLRB’s decisions
    made a related employer liable for employee wages, and others did not.  The
    result in each case, it seems to me, was primarily fact-driven.  The different
    decisions can be understood by the presence of a particular fact or facts
    in one case and the absence of such a fact or facts in other cases. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    only one or two cases has the OLRB taken an extremely broad approach to the
    interpretation of s. 4 by, in effect, treating it as a “deep pockets provision”.  For
    example, in <i>Re Timberland Ford Inc.</i>, [2004] O.E.S.A.D. No. 917, at
    para. 35, in finding that the test for related employers under s. 4 had been
    met, <span style='line-height:
200%'>Tanya Wacyk, Vice-Chair</span> of the OLRB, based her decision on the reason
    that “[i]f the companies are treated as non-related entities, then [the employee]
    would be deprived of his statutory entitlement to severance as a long-term
    employee.”  This approach, however, is vulnerable to the justified criticism
    that it attaches liability from the simple fact of relatedness under s. 4(1)(a)
    and thereby fails to give any meaning to and renders superfluous s. 4(1)(b).  The
    earlier decisions of employment standards Referees upon which the Director
    seeks to rely are vulnerable to the same criticism.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    when assessed alongside the OLRB’s other decisions concerning the interpretation
    of s. 4 since the current ESA came into force, it would appear that the decision
    in <i>Timberland</i> is an outlier.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a>  Having regard to the fact-driven analysis in
    each case, I am not persuaded that the OLRB’s decisions under the current
    ESA can be characterized as fitting into two competing incompatible lines
    of authority.  Therefore, I find it unnecessary to consider what would be
    the proper approach to judicial review on a reasonableness standard in a
    situation where the administrative tribunal below has developed competing
    and inconsistent lines of decisions. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    remains to consider the argument that the Board’s decision was unreasonable
    considered on its own.   </p>
  <h3>3.  <i>The Board’s decision in this case was not unreasonable</i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    can be no controversy as to the proper approach for assessing whether the
    standard of reasonableness has been met; it was explained clearly by the
    Supreme Court in <i>Dunsmuir</i>, as I have already noted above.  It must
    be justifiable, transparent, and intelligible, and it must <span
style='line-height:200%;color:black'>fall within a range of possible, acceptable
    outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and law.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants and the Director submit that the Board’s interpretation of s.
    4 in this case did not meet this standard because the Board adopted its interpretation
    of the ESA<i> </i>without regard to the principles established by the Supreme
    Court concerning the interpretation of employment standards legislation.  They
    rely on the Supreme Court’s statement in <i>Machtinger v. HOJ Industries
    Ltd.</i>, [1992] 1 S.C.R. 986, at p. 1003:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The objective of the Act is to protect the interests
    of employees by requiring employers to comply with certain minimum standards,
    including minimum periods of notice of termination...The harm which the Act
    seeks to remedy is that individual employees, and in particular non-unionized
    employees, are often in an unequal bargaining position in relation to their
    employers.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Accordingly, an interpretation of the Act which
    encourages employers to comply with the minimum requirements of the Act,
    and so extends its protections to as many employees as possible, is to be
    favoured over one that does not.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>They
    also cite the Supreme Court’s pronouncement in <i>Rizzo v. Rizzo Shoes Ltd.</i>,
    [1998] 1 S.C.R. 27, that any doubt or ambiguity in the text of employment
    standards legislation should be resolved in favour of employees; specifically,
    they point to the statement by Iacobucci J. at para. 36:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[S]ince the ESA is a mechanism for providing minimum
    benefits and standards to protect the interests of employees, it can be characterized
    as benefits-conferring legislation. As such, according to several decisions
    of this Court, it ought to be interpreted in a broad and generous manner.
    Any doubt arising from difficulties of language should be resolved in the
    favour of the [employee] claimant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    overarching general principles, important as they may be, do not efface the
    basic canons of statutory interpretation.  Nor do they dictate that every
    dispute concerning employment standards legislation automatically be resolved
    in favour of employees.  The questions of what benefits are conferred by
    the statute and what are the minimum standards with which employers must
    comply still need to be determined.  Specifically, in the present case, the
    text of s. 4(1)(b) must still be interpreted in the context of the statute
    as a whole.  Doing so requires that some meaning be attached to all the words
    of s. 4(1)(b) – “if the intent or effect of their doing so is or has been
    to directly or indirectly defeat the intent and purpose of the Act”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Contrary
    to the submissions of both the appellant and the Director, it seems to me
    that in interpreting these words the Board did have due regard for the legislative
    purpose of creating statutory minimum entitlements for employees in the context
    of the statute as a whole.  For example, at paragraph 48 of its decision
    dated April 27, 2006, in its consideration of the meaning of the word “effect”,
    the Board recognized that the ESA sets minimum standards, but considered
    them in context.  The Board stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>…[T]he Act sets minimum standards, but it does
    not provide any guarantees that the employees will receive them. Those minimum
    standards exist within a web of laws that grant priority over the assets
    in an unsuccessful business to secured creditors, in this case, the Bank.
    Those minimum standards exist within a legal framework that permits a struggling
    company to go bankrupt, and in the process, shed its liabilities. The legal
    framework that governs companies also permits struggling companies to make
    proposals in bankruptcy to creditors, with the possibility of providing creditors
    with some recovery of the debt owed.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>Without doubt, the Board was referring to the fact that, although
    the ESA does set out minimum employee entitlements, it does not provide any
    special protection to termination and severance pay in the event of a company’s
    bankruptcy.  In order to understand the status of such payments in the context
    of bankruptcy, it is helpful to briefly review the “legal framework” to which
    the Board implicitly referred.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    first note that severance and termination pay constitute “wages” under the
    ESA<i> </i>by virtue of the fact that they are both “any payment required
    to be made by an employer to an employee under this Act” pursuant to s. 1(1).  Although
    s. 14(1) provides that “[d]espite any other Act, wages shall have priority
    over and be paid before the claims and rights of all other unsecured creditors
    of an employer, to the extent of $10,000 per employee”, s. 14(2) states that
    this protection does not apply “with respect to a distribution made under
    the <i>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</i> (Canada) or other legislation enacted
    by the Parliament of Canada respecting bankruptcy or insolvency.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    81(1) imposes joint and several liability on directors of the employer for
    employees’ wages in several circumstances, including where the employer is
    insolvent and the employee has filed a claim for the unpaid wages with the
    receiver or trustee in bankruptcy.  However, s. 81(3) specifically exempts
    directors from liability for termination and severance pay provided for by
    employment contracts or the ESA. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    referring to the effect of these provisions, the Board commented:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The existence of these legal mechanisms, and the
    fact that debts to employees for termination and severance pay have not been
    given priority over debts made to secured creditors means that the Act’s
    minimum standards are not guaranteed to employees or even, to be realistic,
    likely to be paid to employees in the event of a company’s demise. There
    are typically many people with better-protected interests ahead of the employees.
    Whatever one might think of the fairness of such a scheme, it is the one
    that exists.</p>
  <p class=ParaNO>It is clear to me that these comments address the argument
    of both the appellant and the Director.  It confirms that although the ESA
    does prescribe minimum entitlements to employees, it does not guarantee that
    they will be paid in the event of the employer’s bankruptcy. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Against
    this general background, I turn to the Board’s analysis of the undisputed
    evidence in this case.  In its first decision dated October 26, 2005, the
    Board found that the requirements of s. 4(1)(a) were met – all of the respondent
    companies were related businesses.  The issue was therefore whether their
    relatedness had the intent or effect of directly or indirectly defeating
    the intent and purpose of the ESA under s. 4(1)(b)<i>.  </i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    approaching this question in its second decision dated April 27, 2006, the
    Board first noted that “it is a different and separate question” than simply
    whether the respondent companies were related:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If the Legislature had intended to impose liability
    whenever entities were found to have been engaged in related or associated
    activities, it would have said so.  There would be no need then for section
    4(1)(b).  Consequently, I reject the argument that section 4 is a simple
    deep pockets provision that requires only a finding of relatedness between
    a company that can meet its employment standards obligations and a company
    that cannot…All of the Board’s decisions to date interpreting section 4 have
    concluded that after relatedness has been found, it is necessary to make
    a separate inquiry about the intent or effect of that relatedness.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Board also cited the decision of the Divisional Court in <i>Carillon Decorative
    Products Inc.</i> (2004), 71 O.R. (3d) 500, which set aside as unreasonable
    a decision of an employment standards officer which determined that two entities
    were liable for employees’ wages because they were related, without considering
    the intent or effect of that relatedness.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Board then made a crucial finding of fact which, as I have emphasized, is
    not attacked on appeal:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Cat-Dip was propped up by the revenues and financial
    strength of Novaquest, which, in turn, allowed 406 to maintain the lending
    relationship with the Bank that supported Cat-Dip’s mounting losses.  Without
    Novaquest and 406, Cat-Dip would have failed earlier and without the ability
    to meet its employment standards obligations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court put it: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The evidence is clear that Cat-Dip was insolvent
    at least by September 2003. BMO was unwilling to advance further funds, although
    family members of Mr. Lund advanced funds to keep Cat-Dip going. The evidence
    shows that Cat-Dip’s relationship with the other corporations resulted in
    a gain to it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    finding of fact that Cat-Dip’s relatedness to Novaquest and to 406 supported
    the company, rather than consuming assets that might otherwise been available
    to meet Cat-Dip’s employment standards obligations, is a justifiable and
    intelligible basis supporting the Board’s conclusion that the relatedness
    did not have the effect of defeating the intent and purpose of the ESA.  The
    reasoning of the Board is transparent.  As I have already stressed, the intent
    and purpose of the ESA does not guarantee that employees will be paid their
    severance and termination pay entitlements in the event of the employer’s
    bankruptcy. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Board then went on to consider the relationship between Cat-Dip and Catelectric.  Again,
    it found that there was no evidence that any action taken in respect of Catelectric “had
    the effect, either indirectly or directly, on the entitlements of the employees
    of Cat-Dip.”  According to the Board, there was “not a shred of evidence” of
    any collusion or inappropriate activity in the making of Cat-Dip’s proposal
    in bankruptcy to the unsecured creditors.  It was the rejection of that proposal
    that created the opportunity for Mr. Lund to acquire the assets of Cat-Dip
    from BMO and to create Catelectric.  There was simply no basis on which to
    conclude that any action taken by Catelectric affected the likelihood that
    the employees of Cat-Dip would receive their severance and termination pay;
    those payments were not going to be made by Cat-Dip in any event because
    the company was in dire financial straits.  This finding provides a justifiable,
    intelligible, and transparent basis for Board’s conclusion that Catelectric
    and Cat-Dip were not related employers within the meaning of the ESA.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    intent to defeat the ESA was not an issue on this appeal.  The Board found
    as a fact that Cat-Dip’s relatedness to the other companies did not have
    an effect on its capacity to pay the appellants’ termination and severance
    pay. This finding places its conclusion in law that the relatedness did not
    have the effect of defeating the intent and purpose of the ESA among the
    range of acceptable outcomes.      </p>
