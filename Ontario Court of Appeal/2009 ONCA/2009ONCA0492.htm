  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>I. Overview</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      Dr.
    Wright operated on Mrs. Rowlands laparoscopically to remove her gallbladder.
    During the course of the surgery, he cut Mrs. Rowland's common bile duct,
    mistakenly believing it was her cystic duct. Although the cystic duct must
    be cut in order to remove the gallbladder, the common bile duct should not
    be divided or removed as part of gallbladder removal surgery. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      As
    the parties had reached an agreement on damages, the sole issue at trial
    was whether, in cutting Mrs. Rowlands’ common bile duct, Dr. Wright breached
    the standard of care. The trial judge found that Dr. Wright used the proper
    techniques in his approach to identifying the cystic duct. Nonetheless, the
    trial judge concluded that Dr. Wright breached the standard of care.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    main issue on appeal is whether the trial judge made a reversible legal error
    in addressing the standard of care issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      For
    the reasons that follow, I would allow the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'><b>II. Background</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='
line-height:normal;'><b>i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>The
      surgery</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      Dr.
    Wright is a general surgeon. On March 20, 2002 he operated on Barbara Rowlands
    laparascopically to remove her gallbladder. This surgery required that Dr.
    Wright not only identify and remove Mrs. Rowland's gallbladder, but also
    that he identify and remove a segment of her cystic duct and a segment of
    her cystic artery. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      Mrs.
    Rowlands was 41 years old on the date of surgery. She had had a hysterectomy
    at age 34 and suffered from cervical cancer in 1993. Although somewhat overweight
    at the time of surgery, she was otherwise healthy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      During
    the surgery, Dr. Wright encountered a number of intra-abdominal adhesions
    (bands of scar tissue that bind together two anatomic surfaces that are normally
    separate from each other) resulting from her prior hysterectomy. After dissecting
    these adhesions, Dr. Wright reached the gallbladder and found it to be contracted,
    thickened and chronically scarred. He also found adhesions of the omentum
    (an extension of the peritoneum that enfolds one or more organs adjacent
    to the stomach) to the under surface of the gallbladder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      Through
    further dissection, Dr. Wright reached the area known as the “triangle of
    Calot.” Thinking that he had identified the anatomy, Dr. Wright proceeded
    to clip and divide what he believed was the cystic duct and then to dissect
    the gallbladder from the liver bed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      During
    the course of this dissection, Dr. Wright saw a ductal structure leading
    back to the liver. Realizing that something was wrong, Dr. Wright converted
    from the laparoscopic procedure to an open surgical procedure known as a
    laparotomy. Following conversion and further dissection, he discovered that
    Mrs. Rowlands had a cystic duct that was extremely short and extremely small
    in diameter, and that rather than cutting the cystic duct as he believed,
    he had actually cut Mrs. Rowlands’ common bile duct. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    noted by the trial judge Dr. Wright proceeded thereafter in a highly professional
    manner. He requested the assistance of a second general surgeon, Dr. Smith,
    and the two surgeons repaired the common bile duct. Postoperatively, Mrs.
    Rowlands had a lengthy, but successful recovery.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>Expert
      evidence concerning the standard of care</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    parties called three expert witnesses at trial whom the trial judge described
    as “three renowned authorities on the phenomenon of biliary injury in laparoscopic
    surgery.” Dr. Jeffrey Barkun was called by the respondents; Dr. Eric Poulin
    and Dr. Suryacant Chande were called by Dr. Wright.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    there may have been some disagreement among the experts concerning the extent
    to which other techniques play a necessary role in anatomical identification
    during gallbladder surgery, there was no real dispute that obtaining &quot;the
    critical view&quot; reflects the standard of care in laparoscopic gallbladder
    removal surgery.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Dr.
    Barkun described obtaining the critical view as essentially cleaning out
    the area of the triangle of Calot so you can see the base of the liver through
    it and so you can obtain the perspective necessary to determine whether there
    are any tubular structures going back towards the liver. Dr. Barkun said
    the triangle of Calot is an anatomical landmark bounded by the inferior edge
    of the liver on the top, the cystic duct to the patient's right, and the
    common hepatic duct to the patient's left. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    Dr. Barkun's view, Dr. Wright was not successful in obtaining the critical
    view during laparoscopic surgery and should have converted to open surgery
    before cutting. Among other things he said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='line-height:normal;'>[G]iven that it was possible
    to dissect out the cystic duct, meaning that there was a plane that allowed
    to give the critical view, I feel that at the time of the laparoscopic procedure
    the critical view was not truly obtained. It was truly obtained only after
    conversion occurred.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='line-height:normal;'>                                                            …</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote style='line-height:normal;'>I would say in this case
    the judgment has to do with did I have enough of an area that was clear to
    be able to have the perspective to see that this 5 milimeter structure ...
    is the cystic duct or not especially given the fact that I realize that I've
    hit adhesions and scarring at every step of the way.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Neither
    Dr. Poulin nor Dr. Chande shared Dr. Barkun’s opinions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></b><b>Dr.
      Wright’s evidence</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    he may not have used this terminology in his postoperative report, Dr. Wright's
    description of the surgery indicated that he used two techniques to identify
    the anatomy, the infundibular technique and the critical view technique.
    Dr. Wright testified expressly that he obtained the critical view.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>III. Analysis</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that the trial judge made a reversible legal error by importing
    common sense into the assessment of whether Dr. Wright breached the standard
    of care. I agree with this submission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><b>The
      Trial Judge’s  Reasons</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge correctly identified many of the legal principles relevant to
    determining the standard of care:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    surgeon has a duty to conduct his practice in accordance with the conduct
    of a prudent and diligent surgeon in the same circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is generally accepted that when the doctor acts in accordance with a recognized
    and respected practice of the profession, he or she will not be found to
    have acted with negligence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Courts
    should be careful not to rely upon the perfect vision afforded by hindsight.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    law recognizes that doctors should not be held liable for a mere error of
    judgment, as distinguished from professional fault.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the trial judge went on to state the following:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>But there is a duty on the court to weigh whether
    reasonable precautions readily apparent to the ordinary finder of fact have
    been followed, even where it appears certain a standard medical procedure
    was in place. <i>Put another way, a finder of fact may use common sense in
    assessing the surgeon’s conduct as he followed the standard medical practice
    described by the experts.</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In this operation, it is established by all the
    evidence that the defendant used the proper techniques in his approach to
    isolating the cystic duct before transection, including dissection and maneuvering
    of cameras. He then made an intra-operative decision that he had identified
    the two anatomical structures to be clipped and divided, the cystic duct
    and artery. <i>But one might reasonably ask, what about the other vital structures
    inhabiting the immediate anatomical triangle, especially the bile duct</i>? </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:normal;
'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The defendant brought to his task a high degree
    of skill, knowledge and experience, catalogued earlier in these reasons.
    At the critical time, however, he failed to adopt reasonable precautions
    when he transacted a duct without having a sufficiently clear view of all
    the vital ducts in the vicinity of the triangle. And the defendant, as I
    have said, was put on some notice that the necessary “critical view” might
    be impeded by the known hysterectomy some eight years previous, the resulting
    scar tissue present in the abdominal area, as well as the patient’s obesity.
    [Emphasis added.] </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>            ii) Discussion</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    above-noted passages demonstrate that although he found that Dr. Wright followed
    the proper techniques in attempting to isolate the cystic duct, the trial
    judge also concluded that “common sense” required Dr. Wright to go further
    and identify the other anatomical structures in the area, “especially the
    bile duct.” Put another way, in effect, the trial judge relied on common
    sense to find that the then current surgical techniques were inadequate.
    In my opinion, on the facts of this case, the trial judge was not entitled
    to do so. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    common sense no doubt has a role to play in assessing medical negligence,
    it plays a limited role “where a procedure involves difficult or uncertain
    question of medical treatment or complex, scientific or highly technical
    matters that are beyond the ordinary experience and understanding of judge
    or jury.”:<i> Ter Neuzen v. Korn,</i> [1995] 3 S.C.R. 674 at para. 51.  In
    such cases, it will not generally be open to the trier of fact to find a
    standard medical practice negligent, subject to an exception where “a standard
    practice fails to adopt obvious and reasonable precautions which are readily
    apparent to the ordinary finder of fact”: <i>Ter Neuzen, </i>at para. 51.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the evidence at trial demonstrated that proper identification
    of the cystic duct is the Achilles heel of gall bladder surgery, whether
    performed laparascopically or by open surgery. Although various surgical
    techniques have been developed over time to attempt to address this problem,
    common bile duct injury resulting from its misidentification as the cystic
    duct remains a potential complication of gallbladder surgery, albeit a rare
    one.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    expert witnesses at trial were generally agreed that the critical view technique
    reflects the standard of care in terms of avoiding misidentification of the
    cystic duct. None of the expert witnesses testified that the critical view
    technique requires the surgeon to identify the common bile duct before cutting.
    On the contrary, an article by Dr. Steven Strasberg that Dr. Barkun recognized
    as authoritative specifically states that “it is not necessary to expose
    the common bile duct” when using the critical view technique. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    Dr. Poulin stated in his evidence that with the emergence of laparascopic
    surgery, surgeons adopted a practice of avoiding the common bile duct in
    order to reduce the risk of injury through devascularisation:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Historically surgeons were taught to dissect the
    cystic duct all the way to the junction with the common duct …when laparscopic
    surgery occurred a quantum change in trying to convince the surgeon to stay
    away from the common duct. Basically dissect infundibulum of the gallbladder
    and take whatever you need to make a safe application of clips on the early
    part, if you wish, of the cystic duct, and get out of Dodge. Stay away from
    the common duct, don’t devascularize the common duct, stay away from it.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Particularly
    in the face of Dr. Poulin’s evidence, in my opinion, the trial judge erred
    by finding that Dr. Wright was required to identify the common bile duct
    before cutting. Isolating and identifying the common bile duct is not part
    of the accepted surgical technique for avoiding common bile duct injury through
    misidentification of the cystic duct. Further, Dr. Poulin’s evidence suggests
    that dissecting to the common bile duct creates its own set of risks. Dr.
    Poulin’s evidence belies any suggestion that identifying the common bile
    is an “obvious and reasonable precaution…readily apparent to the ordinary
    trier of fact.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the face of an apparently conflicting medical opinion as to what actions
    were required in the circumstances, it was not appropriate for the trial
    judge to assess the surgeon’s conduct based on common sense. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my opinion, the live issue for determination by the trial judge was whether
    Dr. Wright went far enough in attempting to obtain the critical view. Dr.
    Barkun suggested that he did not. Although Dr. Wright testified that he obtained
    the critical view, as was pointed out by Dr. Barkun, Dr. Wright did not identify
    in his post-operative report the visual cues he relied on in making the assessment
    that he had properly identified the cystic duct. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    fact that Dr. Wright may have used the proper techniques does not demonstrate
    that he went far enough in dissecting before making the decision to cut.
    There is a difference between using the appropriate technique and executing
    it properly. Based on my review of the trial judge’s reasons, he did not
    make a finding concerning this important issue and concerning whether Dr.
    Wright, in fact, obtained the critical view. Such findings are essential
    to determining whether Dr. Wright met the standard of care.  In the circumstances,
    I see no option but to order a new trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>IV. Disposition </b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
    on the foregoing reasons, the appeal is allowed, the judgment below is set
    aside and a new trial is ordered. Costs of the appeal are to the appellant
    on a partial indemnity scale fixed in the amount of $15,000 inclusive of
    G.S.T. and disbursements. </p>

    addition to the main issue on appeal, the appellant requested leave to appeal
    the trial costs awarded to the respondents. At the oral hearing, the respondents
    conceded that, having expressed an intention to award partial indemnity costs
    to the date of the offer to settle, it appears that the trial judge awarded
    substantial indemnity costs throughout erroneously. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    having set aside the judgment below, including the costs award, it is not
    strictly necessary that I address the request for leave to appeal. Costs
    of the trial are to the appellant in the cause in an amount to be determined
    by the trial judge on the new trial.</p>
