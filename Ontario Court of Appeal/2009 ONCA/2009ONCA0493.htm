    the <i>Retail Sales Tax Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. R.31, and the regulations
    made pursuant to it, purchasers of books that are printed and bound and are
    published solely for educational, technical, cultural or literary purposes
    and contain no advertising are exempt from retail sales tax.  </p>

    respondent, an architectural partnership operating in Ontario, caused a third
    party to prepare volumes of designed blueprints and architectural and construction
    specifications, which the respondent then purchased and distributed to other
    construction consultants, general contractors and those in the building trades.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    issue in this appeal is whether the respondent was required to pay retail
    sales tax when it purchased the volumes from the third party.  At first instance,
    Spies J. found for the respondent and held that it was not.  The Minister
    of Finance has appealed.  For the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the
    appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      sections of the Act relevant to this appeal are ss. 2(1) and 7(1)45.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>2. (1) Every purchaser of tangible
      personal property, except the classes thereof referred to in subsection
      (2), shall pay to Her Majesty in right of Ontario a tax in respect of the
      consumption or use thereof, computed at the rate of 8 per cent of the fair
      value thereof.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>7. (1) The purchaser of the following
      classes of tangible personal property, taxable services and admissions
      to a place of amusement is exempt from the tax imposed by section 2:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>…</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
lang=EN-US>45.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Books,
      as defined by the Minister, and repairs thereto.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      Act was first introduced in 1961.  From the beginning, books were exempt
      from retail sales tax.  The purpose of this exemption was simply the social
      desirability of encouraging the reading of books.  The 1967 report of the
      Ontario Committee on Taxation says as much (at Volume 3, paras. 75 and
      79).  The appellant does not contest this.  Until 1982, the definition
      of “books” was in the legislation itself.  At that point the definition
      was moved into the regulations made under the Act.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Today,
      the relevant regulation is <i>Definitions, Exemptions and Rebates</i>,
      R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 1012:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>1.(1)  The following expressions
      used in subsection 7(1) of the Act are defined by the Minister:</span></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><span lang=EN-US>“books”
    means books that are printed and bound and that are <u>published</u> <u>solely</u> for
    educational, technical, cultural or literary purposes and that contain no
    advertising, including pages that are printed for insertion in such books,
    but not directories, price lists, time tables, rate books, catalogues, reports,
    fashion books, albums, books ruled for accounting or bookkeeping purposes,
    blank exercise, drawing or work books or any similar books and loose leaf
    sheets or pages that are printed for insertion in such books.  [emphasis
    added]</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      relevant facts are essentially undisputed.  In the course of its activities
      as an architecture and project management firm, the respondent prepares
      volumes of design drawings and other architectural and construction specifications
      to be used in connection with building and design construction.  The original
      materials are then provided to a third party duplicator for copying, stapling
      and binding into book form.  The respondent then purchases the volumes
      from the duplicator and distributes them to other construction consultants,
      general contractors and those in the building trades.  In some cases the
      volumes are distributed free of charge by the respondent.  In other cases
      they are sold by the respondent.  On a large building project, 60 to 70
      sets of volumes are made and distributed.  The parties agree that, although
      it is not certain, it is to be presumed that the volumes are not for sale
      to the general public and are kept confidential by those who obtain copies.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>All
      of the volumes are books that are printed and bound, are technical in nature
      and contain no advertising.  None are directories, price lists or any of
      the other specific types of books that are excluded from the definition
      of “books” in the regulation.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

      appellant Minister is responsible for administering the Act.  The respondent
      lodged claims with the Minister seeking a refund for the retail sales tax
      it paid from June 1994 to February 1995 and from February 1995 to February
      1999 on its purchases of the volumes from the duplicator.  The appellant
      disallowed the claims and the respondent appealed.  Under the Act, these
      appeals are deemed actions in the Superior Court of Justice.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge allowed the appeal and concluded that the respondent’s claims
      for refund should be allowed pursuant to those provisions of the <i>Act</i> that
      entitle the taxpayer to a refund of tax that was not required to be paid
      in the first place  She found first that the volumes were “published”,
      because that term speaks to the purpose of publication, and that its ordinary
      meaning, namely to make available to at least one person, was met in this
      case.  Secondly, she concluded that, having regard to the content and intended
      use of the volumes, they were solely technical.  Thus the volumes were
      books that were exempt from retail sales tax when purchased by the respondent.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      fundamental issue in this appeal is whether the volumes in question meet
      the definition of “books” in Reg. 1012.  The appellant accepts that the
      volumes are books that are printed and bound, contain no advertising, are
      technical in content, and are not within the specific exclusions from the
      definition found in the regulation.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However,
      the appellant says that for two reasons the volumes do not come within
      the definition.  First, the appellant argues that the volumes are not “published” because
      they are not produced for sale to the public or made generally available
      to the public.  Second, the appellant says that the volumes do not meet
      the “solely” for technical purposes requirement.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
      turn first to the requirement in Reg. 1012 that “books” means books that
      are published.  Only books that are published are exempted.  This requirement
      focuses on the books and whether they are published.  It does not require
      the identification of anyone as the publisher.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
      cannot agree with the appellant that books must be produced for sale to
      the public or be made generally available to the public to attract the
      exemption.  There is nothing in the language of the regulation that requires
      that a book be sold to or made available to the general public rather than
      merely to a targeted part of the public in order to qualify.  In fact,
      the extension of the definition to technical works, which are very likely
      to be targeted not to the public but to a selected group, clearly suggests
      the contrary.  Moreover, to limit the definition in this way would undercut
      the purpose of the exemption, namely to encourage the reading of books
      in the public interest, because it would exclude books published for specialized
      audiences.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      my view, in the context of the Act and the regulation, books “are published” if
      they are disseminated or distributed to others.  That is the plain and
      ordinary meaning of the phrase in the regulation.  This accords with the
      first definition of “publish” found in the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>,
      2nd ed., namely to “disseminate”.  It also serves the exemption’s purpose
      of encouraging the reading of books by including in the exemption books
      distributed just to a targeted audience.  This would include in the exemption
      the distribution of, for example, educational books distributed only to
      school children, or cultural books distributed only to a specific cultural
      community, or technical books distributed only to those who could make
      use of them, all of which surely serve the public interest sought to be
      achieved by the regulation.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      this case, the volumes in question are distributed to those who can use
      them, namely construction consultants, general contractors and those in
      the building trades.  In my view, this means they “are published” for the
      purposes of the regulation and meet this qualification for being “books”.  Given
      this range of recipients, it is unnecessary to decide whether distribution
      to one person alone would be sufficient or whether, as in this case, a
      larger targeted audience is necessary.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant seeks some support for his position that these volumes are not
      published by looking to s. 7(1)40 of the Act and another of its regulations, <i>General</i>,
      R.R.O. 1990, Reg. 1013.  In combination, they provide that the exemption
      provided to a manufacturer or producer for purchase of materials that are
      then used to manufacture or produce tangible personal property does not
      apply to architects who produce printed matter in connection with rendering
      professional services.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant argues that this shows a legislative intention that the tax apply
      to firms like the respondent in the circumstance of this case.  I do not
      agree.  The exclusion of architects from the exemption of purchases that
      go into producing “in house” materials simply does not speak to the facts
      in this case where the respondent purchases books that it then disseminates
      to a target audience.  The respondent is not purchasing materials that
      go into its in house productions.  The exclusion in Reg. 1013 simply does
      not apply to the exemption at issue.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      second aspect of the definition of “books” raised by the appellant is the
      requirement that they be published “solely” for a technical purpose.  As
      I have said, the appellant does not contest that the volumes in question
      here are for a technical purpose. However, the Minister argues that they
      are prepared to allow the respondent to fulfill its contracts with clients
      and are therefore not solely for a technical purpose. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      answer to this argument is found in the distinction between the intention
      of those producing the book and the purpose of the book itself.  In my
      view, the definition in the regulation speaks to the latter and not to
      the former.  The requirement is that the book serve an educational, technical,
      cultural or literary purpose for those who use it.  This is determined
      by the content of the book not what is in the minds of those who produce
      it.  That is the plain meaning of the language of the regulation.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Moreover,
      if the intention or purpose of the producer was the measure of this requirement
      it would exempt from this exclusion any books produced for sale, since
      that would bespeak a commercial purpose as at least one of the purposes
      and thus take it outside of the four purposes permitted by the regulation.  That
      simply cannot have been the intention of the drafters of a regulation that
      is part of a commercial sales regime.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant acknowledges that the volumes in question have a technical purpose.  The
      commercial purpose or intention of the respondent is not relevant to the “sole
      purpose” requirement of the regulation.
     Since the appellant acknowledges that the volumes in question do indeed
    have a technical purpose, this aspect of the definition of “books” as set
    out in the regulation is met.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      summary, the appellant acknowledges that the volumes meet all the requirements
      of Reg. 1012 save the two challenged.  I have concluded that neither of
      the appellant’s challenges can succeed and that the volumes meet these
      two requirements as well.  When the respondent purchased these volumes,
      the respondent was therefore exempt from retail sales tax.  </span></p>
