    appellant’s conviction for first degree murder was set aside by this court
    on October 21, 2008, and a new trial was ordered.  The appellant’s application
    for judicial interim release pending his new trial pursuant to s. 522 of
    the <i>Criminal Code</i> was denied on December 23, 2008.  This is a review
    of that decision, as ordered by Winkler C.J.O., pursuant to s. 680 of the <i>Criminal

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Facts</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    March 20, 1992, the deceased, Paul Kneeshaw, was shot to death while standing
    outside a shed on his property.  The appellant was a close friend and business
    associate of the deceased.  At the time of the murder, the appellant was
    living with the deceased and his wife, Colleen Kneeshaw, with whom the appellant
    was engaged in a brief romantic relationship.  The appellant and his son,
    William Vanderheyden, were arrested and charged with first degree murder
    of the deceased on February 1, 1994.  The Crown’s theory was that the appellant
    had contracted his son to murder Kneeshaw both because of resentment over
    a failed business deal and as part of a plan to eliminate Kneeshaw, marry
    Colleen and assume Kneeshaw’s wealth.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    March 31, 1994, McMurtry C.J. (then Chief Justice of the Superior Court)
    ordered that the appellant be released on bail pending his trial, secured
    by $250,000 pooled together by four named sureties.  McMurtry C.J. found
    that the case against the appellant was “not overwhelming”, and that there
    was not a substantial likelihood that he would interfere with the administration
    of justice.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial did not begin until August 1997.  On October 22, 1999 both the appellant
    and his son were convicted of first degree murder.  The appellant abided
    by his bail conditions for the entirety of the five and one half years that
    he was at liberty pending his trial and conviction.  The only incident that
    occurred during that period was in November 1997, when his former wife, Lynda
    Smith, alleged that the appellant had driven by her residence during the
    court’s lunchtime recess.  If so, that would have been a violation of the
    non-contact terms of his bail conditions.  The Crown applied to revoke the
    appellant’s bail and the application was dismissed by McLean J. on the ground
    that the Crown had failed to prove the acts alleged against the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant sought release pending appeal after his conviction.  That application
    was dismissed.  However, when the appeal was heard in October 2008, the Crown
    conceded that there had been a serious error at trial, namely, the trial
    judge had forbidden both the appellant and his co-accused son from challenging
    the factual underpinnings of the son’s already existent convictions for counselling
    murder.  The appeal was allowed with a brief judgment and a new trial was
    ordered: <i>R. v. Vanderheyden</i>,<i> </i>2008 ONCA 733.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant applied for release from custody pending his new trial.  The application
    was heard on December 18 and 23, 2008.  The application judge denied the
    application on both the secondary and tertiary grounds as defined by ss.
    515(10)(b) and (c):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=indentlabel1>(10)</span>     For the
    purposes of this section, the detention of an accused in custody is justified
    only on one or more of the following grounds: </p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(<span class=italic1>a</span>)       where
    the detention is necessary to ensure his or her attendance in court in order
    to be dealt with according to law;</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(<span class=italic1>b</span>)       where
    the detention is necessary for the protection or safety of the public, including
    any victim of or witness to the offence, having regard to all the circumstances
    including any substantial likelihood that the accused will, if released from
    custody, commit a criminal offence or interfere with the administration of
    justice; and</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(<span class=italic1>c</span>)       if the
    detention is necessary to maintain confidence in the administration of justice,
    having regard to all the circumstances, including </p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(i) the apparent strength of the prosecution’s
    case, </p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>            (ii)       the gravity of the offence, </p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(iii)     the circumstances surrounding the
    commission of the offence, including whether a firearm was used, and </p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(iv)      the fact that the accused is liable,
    on conviction, for a potentially lengthy term of imprisonment or, in the
    case of an offence that involves, or whose subject-matter is, a firearm,
    a minimum punishment of imprisonment for a term of three years or more. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the secondary ground, the application judge found that the case against the
    appellant was “strong”, and also that there were
    “very substantial concerns that the appellant would offend or interfere with
    the administration of justice if released on bail.”  This second finding
    was based on an allegation of the appellant’s ex-wife, Lynda, a key crown
    witness, that in January 2008, their son, Robert Vanderheyden (not the co-accused),
    had offered Lynda $150,000 on behalf of the appellant and mentioned that
    the appellant had his appeal coming up.  The application judge also stated
    that he was not satisfied that the proposed sureties could adequately reduce
    the risk of the appellant interfering with the administration of justice,
    since the appellant would not be living with his proposed sureties </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the tertiary ground, the application judge noted that that ground had not
    been considered by McMurtry C.J., as s. 515(10)(c) was not then in force.  He
    also recognized that it is only in a very rare case that detention pending
    trial will be justified on this ground.  However, he found the appellant’s
    situation to be such a rare case due to the strength of the Crown’s case,
    the severity of the alleged offence, the brutal circumstances of the murder
    and the potential for a lengthy sentence.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    680 of the <i>Criminal Code </i>provides that on a review of a decision to
    refuse judicial interim release pursuant to s. 522, this court may </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a)       vary the  decision; or</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b)       substitute such other decision as, in
    its opinion, should have been made.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the following reasons, we respectfully disagree with the decision of the
    application judge and order that the appellant be granted judicial interim
    release pending his new trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    emphasize that as the appellant comes before us awaiting trial, he is entitled
    to the presumption of innocence.  While he lost the benefit of that presumption
    upon his conviction in 1999, that conviction has been set entirely aside
    because of an error that the Crown itself conceded rendered the trial unfair.  We
    cannot ignore the conviction because it is part of the history of the case
    and explains why we are now considering bail pending trial at a point when
    the appellant has served almost ten years in prison.  However, the conviction
    is otherwise irrelevant to our task.  The appellant is legally entitled to
    go back to “square one” and benefit from the crucial core value of our legal
    system, enshrined in s. 11(d) of the <i>Charter,</i> that everyone accused
    of a crime is entitled “to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according
    to law in a fair and public hearing”.  This right has been described by the
    Supreme Court of Canada as “essential in a society committed to fairness
    and social justice”: <i>R. v. Oakes</i>, [1986] 1 S.C.R. 103, at p. 120,
    per Dickson C.J. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is common ground that, as the appellant is charged with first degree murder,
    s. 522(2) operates so as to place upon him the burden of showing cause why
    his detention pending trial is not justified under the three grounds specified
    in s. 515(10) and set out above. </p>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US>Primary Ground</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown does not dispute that the appellant has satisfied the primary ground
    and that his detention is not required to ensure his attendance at trial.</p>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US>Secondary Ground</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    disagree with the application judge’s conclusion that the appellant fails
    to meet the secondary ground on the basis that the Crown’s case is “strong” and
    that there are “very substantial concerns”
    that the appellant would offend or interfere with the administration of justice
    if released on bail.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to the strength of the Crown’s case, we agree with McMurtry C.J.’s
    assessment of the case against the appellant as “not overwhelming”.  As counsel
    for the Crown fairly conceded before us, the Crown’s case is almost inevitably
    weaker now given the passage of time since this crime was committed.  One
    witness has died and the evidence of Debbie Vanderheyden as to an incriminating
    statement allegedly made by the appellant prior to the murder has been significantly
    undermined by her cross-examination at trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge based his assessment of the risk of interference with the
    administration of justice primarily on Lynda Smith’s unsworn complaint that
    she was offered $150,000 by the appellant through their son, Robert Vanderheyden.  However,
    that evidence suffers from several defects.  First, Smith’s allegation is
    vague and lacking in detail.  In particular, she did not state that this
    offer was accompanied by any threat from the appellant or request by him
    to change her evidence about the murder.  Second, the alleged offer was made
    before the appeal was heard, and therefore before the appellant knew that
    he would face a new trial.  Third, Robert Vanderheyden denies that he made
    any such offer on behalf of his father.  Fourth, Smith is involved in a civil
    dispute with Robert Vanderheyden over the proceeds of a real estate deal
    and, within days of the alleged offer from the appellant, she commenced a
    civil action against Robert for $165,000.  Her evidence is not strong enough
    to warrant a conclusion that there is a substantial likelihood that the appellant
    would interfere with the administration of justice if released from custody.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    turn now to the appellant’s record of compliance with the terms of his judicial
    interim release pending trial.  In our view, the fact that the appellant
    spent five and one half years on relatively lenient terms pending his trial
    without incident has a strong bearing on the risk he now poses.  We agree
    with Mr. Lockyer’s submission that given the appellant’s proven record of
    compliance with his conditions of bail pending trial, his case for release
    pending trial is now even stronger than it was when he was granted bail in
    1994.  As we read his reasons, the application judge gave no meaningful consideration
    to this factor.  We would add that the appellant’s case also appears to be
    somewhat stronger than in 1994 in that the proposed sureties are more numerous
    and the amounts available are significantly higher. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    recognize that the appellant was convicted in 1992 of assault causing bodily
    harm and uttering threats with regard to Smith. However, those convictions
    did not prevent the appellant from obtaining bail in 1994, and they are now
    dated.  As we have noted, the appellant did not attempt to interfere with
    Smith during the five and one half years before his first trial.  The fact
    that the appellant is now almost 65 years old and has served almost ten years
    in prison also reduces the risk that he will commit another offence if released. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown expresses concerns that the appellant will attempt to influence the
    future testimony of his son Robert, with whom he is now reconciled.  However,
    Robert has assured the police that, despite their reconciliation,, he will
    give the same evidence at the new trial that he gave at the first trial. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Viewing
    this evidence as a whole, we are satisfied that the appellant’s detention
    pending trial is not required on the secondary ground. </p>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US>Tertiary Ground</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    also disagree with the application judge that detention pending trial is
    justified on the tertiary ground.  As the application judge recognized, and
    as both the Supreme Court of Canada and this court have held, bail can be
    denied under the tertiary ground only in limited circumstances: <i>R. v.
    Hall</i>, [2002] 3 S.C.R. 309, at paras. 31, 85; <i>R. v. LaFromboise</i> (2005),
    203 C.C.C. (3d) 492, at para. 23. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    we have already indicated, we would describe the Crown’s case as “not overwhelming” rather
    than as “strong”.  While this is a serious offence involving a brutal murder
    for which the appellant will face a lengthy sentence if convicted, we disagree
    that his detention “is necessary to maintain confidence in the administration
    of justice” when the case is looked at as a whole. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>R.
      v. Hall supra</i>, at para 41, McLachlin C.J.C. stated: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>At the end of the day, the judge can only deny
    bail if satisfied that in view of these factors and related circumstances,
    a reasonable member of the community would be satisfied that denial is necessary
    to maintain confidence in the administration of justice. </p>
  <p class=ParaNO>Similarly, this court held in <i>R. v. Dhillon</i>, [2002]
    O.J. No. 3451, at para. 28:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>…the applicant must show that his detention is
    not necessary to maintain confidence in the administration of justice. It
    is the confidence of a reasonable, informed and dispassionate public that
    provides the measure of this ground. As such, the public would understand
    that the applicant has reacquired the presumption of innocence as a result
    of the decision of this court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    public’s interest in the continued incarceration of an individual charged
    with the most serious offence known to the law must be balanced against the
    public’s interest in seeing that no person be unjustly punished and, as in <i>R.
    v. Khan</i> (1998), 129 C.C.C. (3d) 443 (Man. C.A.) at 445, it is our view
    that “confidence in the administration of justice would more likely be compromised
    by detaining a possibly innocent man in custody for a prolonged period pending
    his retrial.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    five and one half years before his trial, the appellant complied with his
    terms of release, and for almost ten years since his conviction at a trial
    it would appear that he has been a model prisoner.  We are informed that
    his trial will not start before early 2010 and is estimated to take up to
    one year. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the public’s confidence in the administration of justice would
    be undermined rather than advanced by detaining the appellant pending his
    trial.  The appellant presents a stronger case for release than he did fifteen
    years ago when he was released pending his trial.  He is now sixty-five years
    old, he is presumed to be innocent, and throughout his fifteen years of involvement
    with the justice system on this charge, he appears to have complied with
    all terms and conditions.  He has the strong support of several reputable
    friends and family members who offer to stand as sureties for him if he is
    released.  He has already served almost ten years after being convicted at
    a trial that the Crown conceded and this court found to be unfair.  To detain
    a man of his age, who is presumed to be innocent and who complied fully with
    the terms of his release pending his first trial, for at least two more years
    pending the determination of the trial would, in our view, be perceived by
    an informed and dispassionate public to be unfair and contrary to our society’s
    sense of justice. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>CONCLUSION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    we set aside the decision of the application judge and order that the appellant
    be granted judicial interim release pending trial.  If counsel are able to
    agree on the precise terms of release, we ask that those terms be presented
    to us in writing.  If counsel are unable to agree, the court will entertain
    submissions from counsel as to the precise terms of release at a time to
    be arranged through the Registrar. </p>
