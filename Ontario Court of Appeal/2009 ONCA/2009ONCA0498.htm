  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    August 18, 2006, the appellant was arrested while working in a game booth
    at the Super Ex, a fair being held on the grounds of
    <st1:PlaceName

    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Park in

    Ottawa.  He was charged with breach of a prohibition order made pursuant
    to s. 161(1)(a) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46, which
    prohibited him from attending a public park where persons under the age of
    fourteen years were present or could reasonably have been expected to be
    present.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    was conceded that the Super Ex at
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">
    Lansdowne
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Park was accessible to the public and was a place where persons under the
    age of fourteen years were present or could reasonably have been expected
    to be present.  The contested issue was whether the appellant was attending
    a park.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    thoughtful reasons, the trial judge found that the Super Ex at Lansdowne
    Park was a public park as that phrase is used in s. 161(1)(a) of the <i>Code</i>.  She
    convicted the appellant.  The appellant appeals his conviction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>FACTS</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    facts are essentially uncontested.  In the spring of 2006, the appellant
    pleaded guilty to one count of sexual interference and one count of sexual
    touching.  The complainants were between the ages of 12 and 14.  The appellant’s
    sentence included an order pursuant to s.161(1)(a) of the <i>Code</i>, prohibiting
    him from attending a public park where persons under the age of fourteen
    are present or can reasonably be expected to be present.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    161(1)(a) reads:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Order of Prohibition</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>161. (1) When an offender is convicted, or is discharged
    on the conditions prescribed in a prohibition order under section 730, of
    an offence referred to in subsection (1.1) in respect of a person who is
    under the age of fourteen years, the court that sentences the offender or
    directs that the accused be discharged, as the case may be, in addition to
    any other punishment that may be imposed for that offence or any other condition
    prescribed in the order of discharge, shall consider making and may make,
    subject to the conditions or exemptions that the court directs, an order
    prohibiting the offender from</p>

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Lansdowne
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Park contains a football stadium, a civic centre with a hockey arena, and
    several other buildings.  There are trees and grassy areas around the perimeter
    of the property, and surrounding some of the buildings.  There is also an
    extensive paved area that serves as a parking lot for events.  The grounds
    are surrounded by a fence and are accessible to the public through several
    gates.  There is an admission fee to gain entry.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Super Ex at
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">
    Lansdowne
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Park included mid-way rides, game booths, concert areas, food courts, and
    a petting zoo.  The appellant was  found  working
     at  a  game  booth  that
     involved  throwing darts at balloons.  It was on the north side of the fairgrounds
    in a long corridor of game booths lined with stuffed animals and other trinkets
    that could be won as prizes.  The corridor, like most areas where people
    walked during the Super Ex, was on the paved area.  The Super Ex was attended
    by what was described as a very young crowd, with a lot of young people who
    appeared to be between 12 and 16 years of age or even younger.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>ISSUE</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this court, the appellant did not contest that he was found in a place that
    was accessible to the public, and that it was a place where persons under
    the age of fourteen were present or could reasonably be expected to be present.  Nor
    did he suggest that s. 161(1)(a) was unconstitutionally vague or overbroad.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    only issue he raises is whether the Super Ex was a
    “park” and therefore a place he was prohibited from attending because of
    the s. 161(1)(a) order.  The appellant’s position is that it was not.  He
    says that “park” ordinarily, in its regular everyday use, refers to a green
    space, such as an area with lawns and gardens or forests and trees, which
    is set aside and maintained for recreational use by the public.  What is
    in essence a parking lot cannot be turned into a park by virtue of the way
    it is being used.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent’s position is that in light of the purpose of s. 161(1)(a), the
    meaning to be given to “public park” cannot be circumscribed by the physical
    geography of the land but must be significantly informed by the use made
    of it.  Approached this way, the appellant was properly found to be at a
    public park on August 18, 2006, contrary to the prohibition order by which
    he was bound.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      issue in this appeal is whether the appellant was attending a “public park…
    where persons under the age of fourteen are present or can reasonably be
    expected to be present” when he was found at the Super Ex at Lansdowne Park
    on August 18, 2006.  This requires an analysis of the meaning of these words,
    and particularly “public park” as that phrase is used in s. 161(1)(a) of
    the <i>Code</i>.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The <i>Code</i> does
      not contain a definition of
    “public park”.  In construing the words in s. 161(1)(a), the well known approach
    described by Professor Driedger in his <i>Construction of Statutes</i>, 2nd
    ed. (Toronto: Butterworths, 1983), at p. 87, is to be used:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>Today there is only one principle
      or approach, namely, the words of an Act are to be read in their entire
      context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the
      scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      purpose of s. 161(1)(a) is to protect children from becoming victims of
      sexual offences at the hands of those who have previously committed certain
      specified offences.  The protection of this particularly vulnerable group
      in Canadian society must inform the task of construing the phrase in issue
      in this appeal.  See <i>R. v. D’Angelo</i> (2002), 8 C.R. (6th) 386 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Section
      161(1)(a) addresses the legislative objective by specifying a number of
      locations that an offender can be prohibited from attending.  The context
      provided by the full list of locations is of assistance in construing the
      phrase in issue here.  Some locations such as day care centers or school
      grounds are places where children will inevitably be present because of
      the activities carried on there.  However, this is not necessarily so for
      other locations such as public parks.  As the Supreme Court of
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    said in <i>R. v. Heywood</i>, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 761, not all public parks are
    places where children are likely to be found.  Wilderness parks for example
    are public parks where nothing goes on that is likely to attract children.  However,
    consistent with the legislative objective, only public parks where children
    are present or can reasonably be expected to be present can be included in
    a prohibition order.  In other words, Parliament has specified locations
    in s. 161(1)(a) because what goes on there makes it likely that young children
    will be present.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Finally,
      in construing the phrase describing the location that the appellant is
      prohibited from attending, sufficient clarity must be given.  An individual
      bound by a prohibition order should be able to know what it requires, since
      breach of the order constitutes a criminal offence.  In <i>R. v. Tremblay </i>(2008),
      89 O.R. (3d) 48 (
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), at para. 10, my colleague Sharpe J.A. put the point this way in interpreting
    a term in a long-term supervision order:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>That said, we must also be mindful
      that failure to comply with the condition constitutes a serious criminal
      offence carrying a period of up to ten years imprisonment and that it must
      be interpreted according to applicable legal principles.  In particular,
      the appellant is entitled to the benefit of the principle explained by
      Dickson J. in <i>Marcotte v.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    (Deputy Attorney General)</i>, [1976] 1 S.C.R. 108, [1974] S.C.J. No. 142,
    at p. 115 S.C.R:</span></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote><span lang=EN-US>No authority is needed for
      the proposition that if real ambiguities are found, or doubts of substance
      arise, in the construction and application of a statute affecting the liberty
      of a subject, then that statute should be applied in such a manner as to
      favour the person against whom it is sought to be enforced.  If one is
      to be incarcerated, one should at least know that some Act of Parliament
      requires it in express terms, and not, at most, by implication.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      light of these considerations how are we to construe the prohibition from
      attending a “public park… where persons under the age of fourteen years
      are present or can reasonably be expected to be present”?  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant argues that only a green space qualifies.  I cannot agree.  The
      legislative purpose, the kinds of locations that can be included in a prohibition
      order, and the ordinary grammatical meaning of the words clearly focus
      on the kinds of recreational activities that the public can engage in at
      the particular location and whether they are likely to involve the presence
      of young children.  There is nothing to suggest that a particular physical
      geography is a vital characteristic.  Indeed there are many locations commonly
      referred to as parks which exhibit little if any greenery.  Skateboard
      parks are but one example.  While in a particular case the presence of
      greenery may help in identifying a location as a public park for the purposes
      of a prohibition order under s. 161(1)(a), I do not think that the absence
      of greenery necessarily excludes it.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      my view, to breach this term of a prohibition order under s. 161(1)(a),
      the person bound by it must be attending at a defined or discrete location
      that is accessible to the public for recreational use that involves or
      is reasonably likely to involve children under the specified age.  In particular
      cases, other factors may also be relevant, such as the presence of greenery
      or the public designation of the location as a park.  Construed in this
      way, the phrase “public park… where persons under the age of fourteen years
      are present or can reasonably be expected to be present” best serves the
      legislative purpose and is most faithful to the ordinary and grammatical
      sense of the words in their legislative context.  Moreover, it provides
      the clarity necessary for the person bound by the order to know the locations
      that must be avoided.</span></p>

      appellant places significant reliance on <i>R. v. Lachapelle</i>,<i> </i>2008
      BCSC 511, where the British Columbia Supreme Court determined that a prohibition
      order in the same terms as the one in this case did not extend to a vacant
      private field where a travelling carnival with amusement rides was being
      held.  As I read the decision, the determining factor seems to be that
      the location was a vacant private field.  If so, I agree with the result.  If,
      however, the decision stands for the proposition that the nature of the
      activities taking place at the location is irrelevant, then respectfully,
      I disagree with it for the reasons I have indicated.</span></p>

      the phrase in issue in this appeal as I have described above, I agree with
      the trial judge that the appellant was in breach of his prohibition order
      when he was found attending the Super Ex at
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Lansdowne
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Park on August 18, 2006.  He was at a defined location to which the public
    had access for recreational use that included or could reasonably be expected
    to include the presence of persons under the age of fourteen years.  Moreover,
    in this case, there was some greenery at the location although it was peripheral.  Finally,
    the location itself was publicly designated as a park.  A person in the appellant’s
    position would reasonably know that he cannot attend that location in those
    circumstances.</span></p>
