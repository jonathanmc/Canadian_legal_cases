    Foschia’s statement of claim against the Conseil Des Ecoles Catholiques de
    Langue Francaise (the “School Board”), was struck out as disclosing no reasonable
    cause of action following a motion brought by the School Board pursuant to
    rule 21.01(1)(b) of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure. </i> He appeals from
    this decision.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1"

    test on a rule 21.01(1)(b) motion has been defined in various ways but, in
    essence, it is that the action is “certain to fail”: <i>Hunt v. Carey</i>,
    [1990] 2 S.C.R. 959, at p. 980 (“<i>Hunt</i>”).  The following torts are
    alleged in the statement of claim: negligence, intentional infliction of
    mental suffering and misfeasance in public office.  At this early stage of
    the proceeding, the torts alleged have, of course, not been proven.  Indeed
    we do not even have the respondents’ statement of defence.  However, in assessing
    whether an action is certain to fail, all the allegations contained in the
    plaintiff’s statement of claim are taken as proven: <i>Hunt </i>at p. 979.     </p>

    Foschia, a single father, was a volunteer and lunch time monitor at the school
    his children attended.  In April 2005, parents of two students complained
    about Mr. Foschia’s behaviour in relation to their daughters.  The principal
    at that time, Ms. Saint-Martin, suspended Mr. Foschia from volunteering and
    restricted his access to school property to the threshold of the Principal’s
    office when waiting for or dropping off his children.  Mr. Foschia pleads
    that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span

    an investigation, Ms. Saint-Martin maintained the restrictions on Mr. Foschia, “despite
    the Children’s Aid Society and police findings that there was no wrongdoing” (para.
    24).</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Foschia met with both Mr. Papineau, the superintendent of the School Board
    until October 2005, and Ms. Tremblay, the superintendent from October 2005
    until April 2006, to resolve the matter. However, his meetings with them
    were unsuccessful (paras. 51, 52 and 58).</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Foschia told Ms. Saint-Martin that her actions had had serious consequences
    for his emotional well-being, and caused him emotional and mental distress
    (para 36). </p>

    Saint-Martin constantly changed and increased the restrictions on Mr. Foschia.
    She created inconsistent rules respecting whether he was allowed to attend
    field trips and school activities (para. 29).  In October 2005, Ms. Saint-Martin
    told Mr. Foschia he was not allowed to communicate with any school personnel
    unless she was present (para. 26).  In February, 2006, she told him that
    he was not permitted to have access to the mailboxes to receive Parent Committee
    mail (para. 30).  Shortly after, Mr. Foschia sent Ms. Saint-Martin a letter
    asking her to justify her latest restrictions (para. 30).</p>

    February 24, 2006, Ms. Tremblay banned Mr. Foschia from the school property

    March 7, 2006, Ms. Tremblay threatened to extend the ban against Mr. Foschia
    attending at the school if he continued to speak publicly about the issue
    of his treatment by the School Board (para. 61).  The ban was then continued
    to June 2006 (para. 34).</p>

    June 21, 2006, interim superintendent Mr. Boutin, who replaced Ms. Tremblay
    while she was on leave, extended the ban on Mr. Foschia to January 31, 2007.  He
    said Mr. Foschia’s behaviour was strange and that he was found hanging around
    the school (para. 65).</p>

    the summer of 2006, Ms. Huard-Watt replaced Ms. Saint-Martin as principal
    of the school.  She maintained the ban on Mr. Foschia despite the fact that
    there was no evidence of wrongdoing on his part (para. 42).  Mr. Foschia
    communicated his concerns regarding the ongoing ban to Ms. Huard-Watt.  She
    confirmed the ban and continues to maintain it to the present (para 48).</p>

    June 21, 2005, Mr. Foschia has sent his correspondence to Ms. Bourgeois,
    the Director of Education, and Ms. Biron, the President of the School Board.  He
    has been either ignored or referred to either the Board’s lawyer or Ms. Tremblay
    (paras 68-69). </p>

  <h4>Allegations of negligence</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Foschia alleges that both Ms. Bourgeois and the Board of Trustees were negligent
    when they refused to look into Mr. Foschia’s allegations against Ms. Bourgeois
    and her subordinates (paras. 4(b), 71).  He further alleges that their refusal
    to consider any viable redress or constructive alternative to the restrictions
    placed on him was a violation of duty to him (para 75).  He seeks a declaratory
    remedy that the conduct of the Board of Trustees has been negligent (para.
    77). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    against Mr. Papineau, Mr. Foschia seeks a declaration that “the failure of
    Papineau to advocate in any way on his behalf was negligent” (para 57). </p>
  <h4>Allegations of intentional infliction of mental suffering</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    para. 39 of the claim, Mr. Foschia alleges that Ms. Saint-Martin’s conduct
    amounts to the tort of intentional infliction of mental suffering because
    she had no justifiable reason to limit his access to school premises; that
    he told her that her actions were having deleterious effects on him; and
    that despite this knowledge she increased the ban.  Mr. Foschia makes the
    same allegations against Ms. Huard-Watt (para. 50), Ms. Tremblay (para. 64)
    and Mr. Boutin (para. 67).  Mr. Foscia also brings this claim against the
    School Board, on the basis that it is liable through the actions of its agents
    (para. 79).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Prior
    to the rule 21 motion being heard, Mr. Foschia apparently submitted a draft
    amended pleading wherein he purported to withdraw his claims of intentional
    infliction of mental suffering.  As a result, the motion judge did not address
    this tort in her reasons.  Accordingly, paras. 1(b), 2(b), 3(a), the first
    part of paragraph 39 as well as its subparagraphs 39(a) and 39(b), all of
    which allege the tort of intentional infliction of mental suffering, are
    struck.  However, as subparagraphs 39(c) &amp; 39(d) allege facts relevant
    to the tort of misfeasance in public office, they may be maintained as part
    of para. 38. </p>
  <h4>Allegations of misfeasance in public office</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Foschia alleges that Ms. Saint-Martin, Ms. Huard-Watt, Supt. Tremblay and
    Supt. Boutin are each liable for misfeasance in public office.  Mr. Foschia
    alleges that the defendants’
    conduct in imposing the restrictions on Mr. Foschia was unlawful, and amounts
    to misfeasance.  Although the defendants have the authority to maintain the
    safety and security of the school environment pursuant to the <i>Education
    Act</i>, R.S.O 1990, c. E.2 (the “<i>Education Act</i>”) and its accompanying
    regulation, <i>Access to School Premises</i>, O. Reg. 474/00, they have exceeded
    that authority, as the restrictions imposed on Mr. Foschia were imposed arbitrarily
    and were deliberately designed to punish him (paras. 14, 15 38).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Foschia states that the Defendant Ms. Saint-Martin based her decision to
    restrict Mr. Foschia’s access to the school on irrelevant factors, including
    her personal animosity to the plaintiff (para. 38(d)), rather than for reasons
    related to the security or proper functioning of the school (para. 41(b)).    </p>
  <h4>Damages claimed</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Foschia alleges that his reputation has been injured by the comments of the
    defendants and the fact that [because of the defendant's actions] many members
    of the community believe that the ban against him is founded on his alleged
    inappropriate conduct (paras. 16, 81-82). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Foschia claims that his emotional well-being has suffered and that he has
    experienced a progressive deterioration in his relationship with his children
    (para 16).  He alleges that the defendants’
    imposition of sanctions has contributed to the aggravation of the emotional
    and psychological consequences upon him and caused him “tremendous pain and
    suffering” (paras 85 and 87).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    against Ms. Saint Martin, Tremblay, Ms. Huard-Watt and Mr. Boutin, Mr. Foschia
    seeks damages for misfeasance in public office and intentional infliction
    of mental suffering,  an award of punitive or exemplary damages, and special
    damages, the details of which are to be proved. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    against the School Board, Mr. Foschia seeks damages for intentional infliction
    of mental suffering and an award of punitive or exemplary damages.  He also
    seeks an order directing the Board to remove its ongoing ban. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    against Mr. Papineau, Ms. Bourgeois, and the trustees of the Board (André Ouellette,
    Brigitte Pilon, Norma Valiquette, Marie Biron, Andrée Newell, Diane Doré,
    Dan Bourdria, Madelaine Chevalier, Robert Tremblay, Denis Poirier, Brian
    Beauchamp, Lise Cloutier and Phillippe Maurice), Mr. Foschia seeks a declaration
    of negligence for failing to assist him, failing to investigate the policy
    violations he alleged, and failing to rescind or recommend the rescission
    of the restrictions on his access to the school. </p>
  <h4>Analysis</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    noted at the outset, for a statement of claim to be struck on a rule 21.01(1)(b)
    motion, it must be plain and obvious that the action, as pleaded, cannot
    succeed: <i>Hunt</i> at p. 979.  It will be plain and obvious that a claim
    cannot succeed where, for example, the claim fails to allege an element(s)
    that is essential to the legal action being taken.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Foschia’s amended statement of claim suffers from many deficiencies.  The
    claim is not “a concise statement of the material facts” as required by rule
    25.06(1), but a pleading that often pleads irrelevant facts, repeats other
    facts and violates the rule against pleading evidence.  That said, the claim
    must still be analyzed to see if discloses a cause of action. </p>
  <h4>Negligence</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Before
    the motion judge, the defendants submitted that the pleadings did not disclose
    a duty of care, which is necessary to ground a claim in negligence.  In <i>Odhavji
    Estate v. Woodhouse, </i>[2003] 3 S.C.R. 263 (“<i>Odhavji</i>”), the Supreme
    Court held that a two stage test must be met in order for a duty of care
    to be established.  In the first stage, it must be determined whether the
    relationship between the parties is sufficiently close to impose on the defendant
    a duty of care in regard to the plaintiff.  Establishing that such a relationship
    exists requires proving that the injury was foreseeable and that the two
    parties stood in a relationship of proximity to one another.  If this first
    stage is met, then a <i>prima facie </i>duty of care has been proven.  In
    the second stage, the issue is whether this duty is negated by broader policy
    considerations, which are not necessarily related to the relationship between
    the specific parties: <i>Odhavji</i>, paras. 46-51. </p>

    the motion, counsel for the Board of Trustees submitted that the violations
    alleged by Mr. Foschia against Ms. Bourgeois and the individual school trustees
    had not been satisfactorily linked to the requirements for the tort of negligence.  The
    motion judge apparently agreed and struck these allegations.  We agree with
    her.  In his statement of claim, Mr. Foschia acknowledged that his complaints
    may not have even been distributed to the individual school trustees.  Even
    assuming that the foreseeability of the damages suffered by Mr. Foschia can
    be deduced from the conduct of the school principals, Mr. Foschia did not
    plead the facts giving rise to a prima facie duty of care towards him by
    Ms. Bourgeois and the individual trustees.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While
    Mr. Foschia did allege that the Board of Trustees failed in its duty towards
    him, the basis of this alleged failure was that the Board of Trustees violated
    its own policies by refusing to investigate the allegations brought to it
    by Mr. Foschia.  It is insufficient to merely allege that the Board of Trustees
    breached its policies.  Mr. Foschia did not allege that Board of Trustee’s
    adoption of its policies gave rise to any positive duty on the part of the
    Board of Trustees towards him.  As stated at para. 26 of <i>Childs v. Desormeaux</i>,<i> </i>[2006]
    1 S.C.R. 643,<i> </i>“even if foreseeability [of injury] were established,
    no duty would arise because the wrong alleged is a failure to act or nonfeasance
    in circumstances where there is no positive duty to act.”  As stated by the
    motion judge at para. 29 of her reasons, nothing in law obliges a school
    principal to continue to accept the services of a volunteer.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge also commented that the declaratory relief requested by Mr.
    Foschia and his claim for an order of <i>mandamus</i>,<i> </i>that the Board
    of Trustees be ordered to lift the ban on his access to school property,
    were more appropriately the subject of judicial review of the Board of Trustee’s
    decisions pursuant to s. 7 of the <i>Judicial Review Procedure Act, </i>R.S.O.

  <h4>Misfeasance in public office </h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    elements of the tort of misfeasance in public office are found in <i>Odhavji, </i>at
    para. 32.<i>  </i>There are three elements unique to this tort which must
    be demonstrated by a successful plaintiff, and two further elements which
    are common to torts generally.  First, the defendant must be a public official
    who was exercising public functions.  Second, the public officer must act
    unlawfully.  The unlawful act can be a breach of relevant statutory provisions,
    acting in excess of the powers granted to the public official, omitting to
    act in circumstances in which the public officer is under a legal duty to
    act, or acting for an improper purpose.  Third, the public official must
    be aware that his or her conduct is unlawful and that it is likely to injure
    the plaintiff.  Fourth, the plaintiff must prove that the public official’s
    tortious conduct was the legal cause of his or her injuries.  Fifth, the
    injuries suffered must be compensable in tort law.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    paras 22-23 of <i>Odhavji</i>,<i> </i>Iacobucci J. discussed two ways in
    which the tort can arise.  He stated: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Category A involves conduct that is specifically
    intended to injure a person or class of persons.  Category B involves a public
    officer who acts with knowledge both that she or he has no power to do the
    act complained of and that the act is likely to injure the plaintiff…. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>….What distinguishes one form of misfeasance in
    public office from the other is the manner in which the plaintiff proves
    each ingredient of the tort. In Category B, the plaintiff must prove the
    two ingredients independently of one another.  In Category A, the fact that
    the public officer has acted for the express purpose of harming the plaintiff
    is sufficient to satisfy each ingredient of the tort, owing to the fact that
    a public officer does not have the authority to exercise his or her powers
    for an improper purpose, such as deliberately harming a member of the public.  In
    each instance, the tort involves deliberate disregard of official duty coupled
    with knowledge that the misconduct is likely to injure the plaintiff. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus,
    while the constituent elements of the tort do not change depending on the
    Category of misfeasance alleged, the way those elements are proven does.  If
    the plaintiff proves that the public official was acting for the improper
    purpose of deliberately causing harm to the plaintiff, this will be sufficient
    to prove both the second and third elements of the tort.  If, on the other
    hand, the plaintiff is alleging misfeasance in the form of Category B, then
    it is necessary to individually prove both the second and third elements.  In
    proving the third element, it is sufficient for the plaintiff to show that
    the public official acted with reckless indifference to both the unlawfulness
    of his or her act and the likelihood that it would injure the plaintiff: <i>Odhavji</i> at
    para. 25, citing <i>Powder Mountain Resorts Ltd. v. British Columbia</i> (2001),
    94 B.C.L.R. (3d) 14 (
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), at para. 7.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    motion judge held that, in essence, Mr. Foschia was seeking to pursue his
    activities as a volunteer without restriction.  She concluded that nothing
    in law obliged the principal of a school to accept all the offers of a volunteer
    or to continue to accept them if accepted initially, and so she dismissed
    his claim, finding that the defendants had not acted unlawfully.  We would
    agree with this aspect of her reasons. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    Mr. Foschia also pleads that the imposition of a complete ban preventing
    him from accessing school property (i.e., to pick up his children, meet with
    his children’s teachers, and attend other activities to which parents are
    invited) and the continuation of it for years amounts to misfeasance in public
    office. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span>  </span>The
    motion judge’s reasons only appear to address the initial restrictions placed
    on Mr. Foschia.  She held that there was no legal basis for Mr. Foschia’s
    claim given the statutory framework set out in the <i>Education Act </i>and
    its accompanying regulations.  Principals have the power to exclude any person
    from a school’s premises if the principal judges that that person’s presence
    is a detriment to the security or well-being of other persons in the school.  The
    motion judge erred in failing to consider the principal’s continuation of
    the ban on Mr. Foshcia, by failing to specifically consider the allegation
    that the extension of the ban to prohibit Mr. Foschia from having any access
    to the school was made for the improper purpose of deliberately harming Mr.
    Foschia.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span> </span> The
    analysis of Mr. Foschia’s claim requires us to consider the five elements
    required for the tort in relation to Mr. Foschia’s claim that the continuing
    ban on him from accessing school property amounts to misfeasance in public
    office. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Neither
    the various individual defendants nor the School Board took issue with the
    allegation that they were public officials who were exercising public functions
    when deciding to ban Mr. Foschia from the school premises.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    his claims against Ms. Saint-Martin and Ms. Tremblay, Mr. Foschia alleges
    misfeasance in public office in the form of the aforementioned Category A.  Mr.
    Foschia alleges that Ms. Saint-Martin’s decision to continue his suspension “appears… to
    have been motivated out of malice”
    (para. 33) and that her conduct stemmed from her “personal animosity” towards
    Mr. Foschia (para. 38(d)).  In the case of Ms. Tremblay, Mr. Foschia alleges
    that her motive in upholding the ban was to try and prevent Mr. Foschia from
    making legitimate complaints about his treatment by the School Board (paras.
    61-62).  As Mr. Foschia alleges that these two defendants acted with the
    intention of harming him, these allegations are sufficient, if proven, to
    satisfy both the second and third elements of the tort of misfeasance in
    public office.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Foschia does not specifically make similar allegations against Ms. Huard-Watt
    or Mr. Boutin.  The only allegations made by Mr. Foschia against Ms. Huard-Watt
    which deal with the ban is that he told her about the history of the ban,
    and that she confirmed the total ban imposed by Mr. Tremblay despite Mr.
    Foschia’s concerns (para. 48).  As for Mr. Boutin, Mr. Foschia’s allegations
    are limited to his claim that Mr. Boutin extended the ban on the bases that
    he found Mr. Foschia’s behaviour to be strange and that Mr. Foschia was found
    hanging around the school (para. 65).  Confined to these allegations, it
    is clear that Mr. Foschia’s claim does not properly allege the necessary
    elements to ground an action for misfeasance in public office, either through
    Category A or Category B.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Reading
    the claim as a whole, however, Mr. Foschia’s allegations against Ms. Huard-Watt
    and Mr. Boutin are not limited to those noted above.  In his claim, Mr. Foschia
    states that he
    “relies on the same facts” pled against Ms. Saint-Martin in support of his
    claims against Ms. Huard-Watt (para. 50) and Mr. Boutin (para. 67).  In one
    respect, it is obvious that Mr. Foschia cannot rely on the same facts for
    each of these defendants.  Many of the factual allegations made against Ms.
    Saint-Martin are very specific to her, and could not possibly be alleged
    against the other defendants.  At the same time, some of the allegations,
    such as the claim that the decision to restrict Mr. Foschia’s access to the
    school was based on personal animosity, are sufficiently general that they
    could be applied to Ms. Huard-Watt and Mr. Boutin without any obvious difficulties.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Additionally,
    in paras. 14-15, Mr. Foschia claims that the restrictions imposed by the
    defendants were designed to deliberately punish him for raising legitimate
    concerns, were unlawful and represent misfeasance in public office.  In para.
    78, Mr. Foschia pleads that, “The cumulative behaviour of the Defendants
    demonstrates a deliberate institutional response to silence, quell or coerce
    the Plaintiff into submission”.  He continues in para. 79, “In all the circumstances,
    the facts disclose that the Defendant School Board intentionally, by the
    action of its agents, inflicted harm upon the Plaintiff by imposing and maintaining
    unnecessary restrictions, including an unnecessary ban against him”.  These
    claims are directed towards all the defendants in the action and, in the
    cases of Ms. Huard-Watt and Mr. Boutin, link the specific allegations against
    Ms. Saint-Martin and Ms. Tremblay to Ms. Huard-Watt and Mr. Boutin so that
    they constitute one continuous course of action.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    a Rule 21 motion, pleadings must be read generously in favour of the plaintiff,
    with allowances made for drafting deficiencies: <i>Williams v. Ontario</i>,
    2009 ONCA 378 (C.A.), at para. 10.<i>  </i>While we acknowledge the difficulties
    in the claims Mr. Foschia makes against Ms. Huard-Watt and Mr. Boutin, we
    believe that on a generous reading of the claim, Mr. Foschia does allege
    that the actions of Ms. Huard-Watt and Mr. Boutin were animated by personal
    animosity and an effort to punish Mr. Foschia.  These allegations bring the
    claim within the Category A approach to proving misfeasance in public office.  However,
    the lack of clarity within Mr. Foschia’s claim makes it necessary for Mr.
    Foschia to amend his pleadings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span>  </span>As
    noted above, at paras. 50, 64 and 67 of his claim, Mr. Foschia has attempted
    to rely on allegations made against Ms. Saint-Martin to ground his claims
    against Ms. Huard-Watt, Ms. Tremblay and Mr. Boutin, respectively.  This
    is improper.  Allegations specific to each defendant must be pleaded.  Therefore
    we would strike these paragraphs.  In the case of Mr. Tremblay, leave to
    amend is not necessary, as the elements of the tort have been pleaded in
    paras. 61-63.  In the cases of Ms. Huard-Watt and Mr. Boutin, we would grant
    leave to amend the improper paragraphs so as to make the required pleadings
    against Ms. Huard-Watt and Mr. Boutin specifically.      </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Returning
    to the elements of the tort, the damages alleged by Mr. Foschia as a result
    of the continuing ban are injury to his reputation, deterioration in his
    relationship with his children, and pain and suffering.  Thus, the ban is
    alleged to be the legal cause of his injuries.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    it is at least arguable that these damages are compensable at law.  In <i>Uni-Jet
    Industrial Pipe Ltd. v.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    (Attorney General) </i>(2001), 198 D.L.R. (4th) 577, the Manitoba Court of
    Appeal held at, para. 66, that the general damages awarded for intentional
    torts resulting in injury to reputation and goodwill are damages “at large”.  Unlike
    the damages caused by negligence, precise measurement should not be expected.  The
    court also awarded punitive damages in that case.  It is arguable that Mr.
    Foschia could receive them in this case.        </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    a generous reading of the pleading, with allowance for inadequacies due to
    drafting deficiencies and assuming the facts as stated in the Statement of
    Claim can be proven, it is not obvious that the action for misfeasance in
    public office is certain to fail.  As a result, we would hold that the motion
    judge erred in striking the claim for misfeasance in public office as against
    Ms. Saint-Martin, Ms. Tremblay, Ms. Huard-Watt and Mr. Boutin.  While misfeasance
    in public office is not actually pleaded against the School Board, it is
    apparent from paras. 78, 79 and 80(c) of the claim that the elements of the
    tort are alleged against the School Board: i.e., it violated its statutory
    responsibilities and its intention in doing so was to harm the plaintiff.  Consequently,
    we would grant leave to amend paras. 3 and 80 of the statement of claim to
    specifically plead misfeasance in public office against the School Board
    as well.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    noted earlier, in addition to the paragraphs that have been struck, many
    of the paragraphs in the claim violate the rules of pleading in that they
    are repetitive, plead irrelevant facts or plead evidence.  These paragraphs
    or portions thereof are too numerous to list.  The claim also suffers from
    the deficiency in that the facts are not all organized chronologically.  However,
    if the claim is struck in its entirety with leave to amend, we fear that
    the parties may go through yet another round of motions in relation to the
    pleading.  It is preferable to strike those portions of the claim which are
    improper.  See Schedule A, attached to this judgment, which indicates which
    paragraphs or portions of paragraphs have been struck, and the reason why
    in each case.      </p>
  <h4>Conclusion</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    would allow the appeal in part by allowing the claim for misfeasance in public
    office to go forward as against Ms. Saint-Martin, Ms. Tremblay, Ms. Huard-Watt,
    Mr. Boutin and the School Board.  In order to ensure that Mr. Foschia’s allegations
    respecting this claim are clear, we would grant leave for him to further
    amend his pleading at paras. 3, 38, 50, 64 and 67.  In all other respects
    we would uphold the striking of the claim.  The result of this is that Marcel
    Papineau, Lise Bourgeois and the members of the Board of Trustees are no
    longer defendants to this action.  </p>
  <h4>Costs</h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although
    success has been divided, Mr. Foschia has achieved a significant success
    and is entitled to costs both here and at first instance.  Accordingly, the
    costs award made against Mr. Foschia by the motion judge is set aside.  Although
    Mr. Foschia argued this appeal himself, he was represented by counsel at
    the motion hearing, and also had the same counsel prepare the materials he
    filed for this appeal.  He chose to argue the appeal without the assistance
    of counsel so as to avoid the cost of paying for his counsel to travel to
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto from
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Ottawa, although he did bear the cost of transporting himself to
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto.  Bearing all of this in mind, we would fix the total amount of costs
    at $10,000, inclusive of costs and disbursements for both the motion and
    the appeal. </p>
