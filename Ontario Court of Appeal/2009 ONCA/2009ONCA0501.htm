  <h4><span lang=EN-US>I.          OVERVIEW</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant seeks to set aside his conviction for sexual assault.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    was tried in Superior Court on a three-count indictment charging that, over
    a four-year period, he (a) sexually assaulted the complainant, (b) invited
    the complainant, a person under the age of 14 years, to touch him for a sexual
    purpose, and (c) touched the complainant, a person under the age of 14 years,
    for a sexual purpose.  The appellant was convicted of sexual assault, but
    acquitted of invitation to sexual touching, and sexual interference, and
    sentenced to a one-year conditional sentence followed by one year of probation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant was 19 years old at the time of the trial.  She alleged that
    the appellant had sexually assaulted her during a period when she was from
    3 to 7 years of age and when the appellants wife was regularly acting as
    babysitter for her and her sister.  She alleged two specific instances: (i)
    an incident of digital penetration followed by intercourse; and (ii) an incident
    of penis touching.  As is often the case in these circumstances, there was
    no evidence corroborating the allegations, nor were there any witnesses to
    the alleged incidents.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant testified at trial.  The trial judge disbelieved his evidence,
    however.  She also rejected the complainants evidence as unreliable and
    specifically found that she had a reasonable doubt about whether the appellant engaged
    in any act of intercourse with the complainant, or caused [the complainant]
    to touch his penis.  Nonetheless, she convicted the appellant of sexual
    assault based largely on what the appellant said during an interview with
    the police.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    behalf of the appellant, Ms. Henein argues that the verdict was unreasonable
    and the reasons inadequate, while acknowledging that these grounds may merge
    in the circumstances of this case.  She contends that the trial judge failed
    to consider the appellants statement to the police in its entirety.  Having
    rejected the complainants testimony and the <i>only</i> evidence of sexual
    assault as testified to by the complainant, the trial judge erred in finding
    the appellant guilty of sexual assault on the basis of his equivocal statement
    to the police.  In addition, she submits that the trial judge improperly
    drew an adverse inference from the appellants silence in respect of two
    matters during the police interview.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the Crown, Ms. Shin characterizes the key issue on the appeal as whether
    it was reasonable for the trial judge to conclude that when the appellant
    told the police he did something very bad and that it got to serious touching,
    he was speaking about touching the complainant in a sexual manner.  She submits
    that this inference was entirely reasonable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, I agree with Ms. Henein.  I would set aside the
    conviction for sexual assault and enter a verdict of acquittal on Count 1.</p>
  <h3 style='line-height:200%;page-break-after:avoid'>II.        FACTS</h3>
  <h3>The Alleged Incidents</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant alleged that the abuse occurred over a four-year period between
    June 1, 1991 and July 14, 1995, when she was between 3 and 7 years of age
    and under the daily care of the appellants wife as babysitter.  Although
    the indictment covered this entire period, the complainant described only
    two separate incidents of a sexual nature that she said took place on the
    couch in the basement of the appellants home.  She alleged that on one occasion
    she was sitting on the appellants lap when he inserted his finger into her
    vagina, then lifted her by the hips, turned her around, and had intercourse
    with her while moving her up and down on his lap by holding her sides.  On
    the second occasion she said that she was watching television when the appellant
    came down into the basement, sat down beside her, and took her right hand
    and placed it on his exposed erect penis, rubbing it up and down.  She was
    not able to say when during the period of the indictment these two incidents
    took place.  That was the extent of her evidence of the alleged abuse.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crowns position at trial was that Count 1 (sexual assault) related to the
    incident of sexual intercourse and touching of the vaginal area, while Count
    2 (invitation to sexual touching) related to the incident concerning the
    appellants penis.  Because the indictment was particularized, Count 3 (sexual
    interference) was confined to the allegation that the appellant had, for
    a sexual purpose, touched the complainant with his hands.  Although the trial
    judge did not believe the appellants evidence, she was not satisfied that
    the appellant had engaged in any act of intercourse with the complainant,
    or that he caused her to touch his penis.  The appellant was acquitted on
    Counts 2 and 3.   However, the trial judge convicted the appellant of sexual
    assault.  In the operative part of her reasons on this point, she said:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I am satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt on all
    of the evidence that [the appellant] touched [the complainant] in a manner
    that violated her sexual integrity.  <i>I am satisfied on the basis of his
    statement to the police that he intended to do so, he was aware of the sexual
    nature of the act, and that it occurred on more than one occasion before
    [the appellant] himself put a stop to it</i>.  I am satisfied that the touching,
    although sexual in nature, was minimal and of minimal duration and I am satisfied
    that [the appellant] stopped his sexual behaviour toward [the complainant]
    because he recognized that it was wrong.  I am satisfied that the touching
    took place at [the appellants] home  within the timeframe set out in the
    indictment.  [The complainant] at the time was not of an age to consent to
    sexual touching.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is the only portion of the trial judges reasons where she explains her rationale
    for the conviction.  It is clear that she was persuaded  based on portions
    of the appellants statement to the police  that <i>something</i> of a sexual
    nature had happened between the appellant and the complainant at <i>some
    time</i> during the period covered by the indictment and, therefore, that
    the appellant was guilty of <i>some</i> act or acts of sexual assault of
    a touching nature.  Respectfully, in my view, this line of reasoning was
    impermissible in the circumstances of this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants statement to the police is the only other source of information
    as to what did or did not happen as between him and the complainant.  Consequently,
    it is necessary to review the statement and the trial judges treatment of
    it, in order to assess whether the verdict was unreasonable. </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant provided a recorded 111-page statement to the police.  Before doing
    so, he was told that the officer with whom he was speaking (Det. Panagabko)
    was a Child Abuse and Sexual Assault investigator and that someone had
    come forward and complained that the appellant had sexually assaulted them.  The
    officer said he needed to find out what the truth is about it, and asked
    the appellant, [W]hat do you know about that situation?  The appellant
    responded,
    Well, if were gonna have the truth, were gonna have the truth.  The trial
    judge found that the appellant intended to tell the truth to Det. Panagabko
    when he gave his statement.  </p>

    flabbergasted when first advised of the situation by Det. Panagabko, but
    immediately thought of the complainants family because he was having nothing
    but trouble with them as a result of a longstanding feud between their two
    sons and his sons.  He guessed the complaint had been made by the complainant
    because, he said, he recalled having to deal with her inappropriate behaviour
    and she was the only child he could think of with whom he had had any real
    physical contact.</p>

    Det. Panagabko confirmed during cross-examination that the appellant did
    not specifically admit to, or talk about, sexually touching the complainant

  <h3 style='line-height:200%;page-break-after:avoid'>III.       ANALYSIS</h3>
  <h3>Unreasonable Verdict &amp; Failure to Consider the Entire Statement </h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my opinion, the trial judge failed to consider the appellants statement
    in its entirety and, as a result, failed to appreciate 
    or simply disregarded  important exculpatory aspects of that statement,
    as outlined above.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Viewed
    as a whole, the appellants statement to Det. Panagabko evolved in the following
    fashion:</p>
  <p>a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    never admitted to, or talked specifically about, sexually touching the complainant
    at any time during the interview.</p>
  <p>b)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    testified that he was able to identify the complainant as the girl in question,
    partly because of the difficulties between his family and hers and partly
    because he remembered having to deal with her inappropriate behaviour and
    she was the only child he could think of with whom he had had any real physical
    contact.</p>
  <p>c)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    complainant was forward with him in ways that made him feel uncomfortable
    and guilty.  He did not understand the reasons for her conduct but thought
    it might have something to do with what had happened in her own home.</p>
  <p>d)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    fell prey to this conduct and did something very bad which destroyed [his]
    life in a way.  It got to serious touching.</p>
  <p>e)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether
    the something very bad and the serious touching were references to something
    of a sexual nature, or whether he was referring to the fact that the complainants
    conduct in sitting on his lap, putting their arms around each other and playing
    the numbers on the back
    game, is not clear from the interview.</p>
  <p>f)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    he wanted to talk to his lawyer to clear things up because the three charges
    that Det. Panagabko had explained to him seemed too much for what had happened.  They
    were more than [he] wouldve thought for what actually occurred,
    and they were going to have to sort of separate  the facts of what [the
    complainant] said from what  happened.</p>
  <p>g)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    was because, if the complainant and Det. Panagabko were saying that the appellant
    touched the complainant in a sexual manner, and that she touched the appellant
    in a sexual manner, then we have a problem
    because I cant say thats true.  Its not true.  What youre saying is
    not true.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge essentially stopped at (d) in her analysis of the appellants
    statement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Following
    her review of the contents of the appellants statement, quoted above, the
    trial judge considered the appellants explanations for his various comments  explanations
    that she ultimately rejected.  The appellant testified that what he meant
    by serious touching was that the complainant got on his lap and tried to
    embrace him and be embraced by him.  When he nodded in response to the officers
    question And it was of a sexual nature? he said he was simply acknowledging
    that he had heard and understood what the officer was saying.  Other language
    used by the appellant during the interview, his lawyer argued, was simply
    an emotional overstatement brought on by the stress he was under at the time
    of the interview.  The trial judge did not accept any of this.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>She
    rejected the appellants explanations, as it was open to her to do.  However,
    it was not open to her to adopt the suspicious, but inconclusive, remarks
    by the appellant at one point in the interview as a wholesale inculpatory
    admission to acts of sexual assault, without assessing the statement as a
    whole and without at least considering and reconciling the balance of the
    appellants statements throughout the interview  some of which, at least,
    were strikingly exculpatory in nature: <i>R. v. Mallory</i> (2007), 217 C.C.C.
    (3d) 266 (Ont. C.A.).  Respectfully, it is my view that the trial judge failed
    to assess the statement as a whole. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the point in the interview where the trial judge notes the appellant chose
    to exercise his right to counsel, and concludes [he] thereafter declined
    to discuss the matter further with the officer, the interview was less than
    one-third completed.  The trial judges entire consideration of the remaining
    two-thirds of the interview, as quoted above, was that, He did say the
    charges is [<i>sic</i>] more serious than I wouldve thought for what actually
    occurred, and when asked by the officer did she touch you in a sexual way? [the
    appellant] responded thats where I have a problem.  We have problem.  But
    it was simply not accurate to say that the appellant declined to discuss
    the matter further.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    portion of the interview that I have cited at length, at paragraph 17 of
    these reasons, shows that the appellant said something very significant after
    he declined to discuss the matter further.  He denied any sexual touching.  In
    substance, he said that if the complainant and Det. Panagabko were alleging
    that he had touched the complainant in a sexual way, and that the complainant
    had touched him in a sexual manner, there was a serious problem because <i>what
    they were saying was not true</i>.   The trial judge makes no reference to
    this denial and no attempt to reconcile it with her apparent interpretation
    of the appellants statement as a complete admission to some form of sexual
    touching, sometime, somewhere.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    misapprehension of the appellants evidence was significant.  Indeed, viewed
    from this perspective, the I have a problem.  We have a problem comment
    is more readily understood as being exculpatory rather than inculpatory,
    as the trial judge appeared to have considered it to be.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    trial judge is entitled, indeed required, to make findings respecting statements
    made by an accused and their meaning.  But she must do so in context and
    on the basis of the statement read as a whole.  Here, the trial judge focussed
    almost entirely on the utterances of the appellant that were capable of an
    inculpatory interpretation and failed to consider or to reconcile the various
    utterances that were at worst equivocal and  in the one instance, at least  markedly
    exculpatory in nature.  In <i>Mallory</i>, this Court recently referred to
    the entire statement principle in the following terms, at paras. 203 and
    208:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In our view, the trial judge erred in approaching
    the utterances as a series of separate statements rather than as one statement.  It
    is well accepted that if the Crown tenders the statement of an accused, it
    cannot pick and choose those parts of the statement that it would like the
    jury to hear; it must take the good with the bad, and both the good and
    the bad are admitted for their truth, for and against the accused.  Moreover,
    a party wishing to adduce a statement must put in as much of the statement
    as is necessary to permit a fair understanding of the individual utterances.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The meaning of an exculpatory utterance proximate
    to an inculpatory utterance is for the jury to determine in the context of
    the
    whole statement.  Giving the jury an isolated utterance taken out of context
    deprives the jury of the opportunity to decide the true meaning of the whole
    statement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    same type of error can occur in a judge alone trial.  There is no obligation
    on a trial judge to mention every syllable of evidence given at a criminal
    trial in his or her reasons for judgment.  However, where the reasons of
    the trial judge disclose a lack of appreciation of relevant evidence, such
    as an important portion of an accused persons statement to police, or a
    disregard of such evidence, a reviewing court will intervene and will conduct
    a limited reweighing of the evidence in order to ensure that an unreasonable
    verdict is not sustained: <i>R. v. Biniaris</i>, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 381, at
    paras. 19-25 and 37.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,
    the statement of the appellant, when viewed in its entirety, was at the most
    equivocal about whether the appellants conduct was sexual in nature.  Given
    that the trial judge did not accept the complainants version of events,
    the appellants statement must stand alone.  However, in light of the various
    exculpatory utterances, the inculpatory portions of the statement relied
    upon by the trial judge cannot support an inference of guilt.  In the absence
    of other evidence  not present here  the ambiguous or equivocal statement
    of the appellant, on its own, cannot meet the stringent test of proof beyond
    a reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    effect, the appellant was found guilty of committing <i>unspecified acts,</i> of
    an <i>unspecified sexual nature</i>, at an <i>unspecified time</i> and in
    (except most generally) an <i>unspecified place</i>.  We dont know what
    the acts were.  We dont know their nature or the circumstances in which
    they are said to have occurred.  We cant divine what facts the trial judge
    found the appellant guilty of committing.  In my opinion, given the trial
    judges rejection of the complainants version of what happened, and the
    remainder of the record before her, no properly instructed trier of fact,
    applying his or her mind to the evidence and acting reasonably, could have
    arrived at the conclusion that the appellant was guilty: see <i>R. v. Burke</i>,
    [1996] 1 S.C.R. 474, at paras. 4-7; <i>R. v. W. (R.)</i>, [1992] 2 S.C.R.
    122, at p. 131.  The conviction is founded on speculation and cannot be sustained.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    this conclusion would be sufficient to dispose of the appeal, an order setting
    aside the conviction is supported in two other respects as well. </p>
  <h3 style='line-height:200%;page-break-after:avoid'>The Conviction on Count
    1 is Inconsistent with the Acquittal on Count 3</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judges decision to convict the appellant on Count 1 (sexual assault),
    based on her finding of sexual touching, cannot be reconciled with an acquittal
    on Count 3, which required a reasonable doubt on sexual touching.  Even accepting
    that a trier of fact is not bound by theories advanced by the Crown or the
    defence, if the appellant were guilty of sexual assault as a result of sexual
    touching, he must also have been guilty of sexual interference, as alleged
    in Count 3, because the complainant was under the age of 14 years.  The proper
    disposition, in such an event, would have been to enter findings of guilt
    on both counts, but to stay the sexual assault <i>simpliciter</i> charge
    on <i>Kienapple</i> principles.  No attempt was made by the trial judge to
    explain this inconsistency.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Charron
    J. dealt with the appellate courts power to interfere on inconsistent verdict
    grounds in <i>R. v. Pittiman</i>, [2006] 1 S.C.R. 381.  At para. 7 she said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The question is whether the verdicts are supportable
    on any theory of the evidence consistent with the legal instructions given
    by the trial judge. Martin J.A. aptly described the nature of the inquiry
    in <i>R. v. </i><i><span
style='font-family:&quot;Times New \(W1\)&quot;;
'>McShannock</span></i><span style='font-family:&quot;Times New \(W1\)&quot;;
'> <span style='

    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
  ), at p. 56, as follows:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>Where on any realistic view of the evidence,
    the verdicts cannot be reconciled on any rational or logical basis the illogicality
    of the verdict tends to indicate that the jury must have been confused as
    to the evidence or must have reached some sort of unjustifiable compromise.
    We would, on the ground that the verdict is unreasonable alone, allow the
    appeal, set aside the verdict, and direct an acquittal to be entered. </p>
  <p><span style='color:black;'>[Emphasis added.]</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly,
    I can see no rational or logical basis upon which the two verdicts may be
    reconciled in this case.  This helps to confirm my view that, in failing
    to consider the appellants statement in its entirety, the trial judge may have
    become confused as to the evidence or she may have reached some sort of
    unjustifiable compromise in arriving at her decision.</p>
  <h3 style='line-height:200%;page-break-after:avoid'>The Right to Silence</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the trial judge erred, in my view, by drawing an adverse inference against
    the credibility of the appellant from his silence with respect to two matters
    during his police interview.  In her reasons, she stated:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Even if I were to accept [the appellants] evidence
    that in response to the question and it was of a sexual nature?, he was
    simply nodding to acknowledge that he heard or understood what the officer
    was saying, [the appellant] then went on to identify [the complainant] <i>without
    demurring as to the sexual characterization of what he was describing</i>.  He
    had no difficulty interrupting the officer and correcting him when he did
    not agree, as when the officer explained Invitation to Sexual Touching and
    [the appellant] responded thats she, she never did. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[The appellants] testimony that he was simply
    referring to [the complainant] getting on his lap, and trying to put his
    arm around her when he told the officer I did something very bad, it got
    to serious touching, its totally destroyed my private life because of
    my guilt
    flies in the face of logic, particularly when assessed in light of [the appellants]
    testimony that although his is uncomfortable with it, he is aware that children
    often sit on the laps of adult males.  [The appellants] discomfort with
    children on his lap more logically flows from the fact that he did do something
    very bad
    to [the complainant], and thereafter was uncomfortable with her or any other
    child getting onto his lap.  <i>I note that [the appellant] did not at any
    point in his statement to police make mention of [the complainant] sitting
    on his lap.</i> [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is apparent that the trial judge used the appellants <i>failure to deny</i> that
    what happened between him and the complainant was of a sexual nature as proof
    that, in fact, it was.  She used his <i>failure to volunteer</i> that the
    complainant at some point sat on his lap as supportive of her conclusion
    that the something very bad he acknowledged happened was something very
    bad of a sexual nature.  In both respects she drew an adverse inference about
    the appellants credibility from his silence.  This, she was not permitted
    to do.  As this Court has recently observed in <i>R. v. Palmer</i>, 2008
    ONCA 797, at para. 9:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It was open to the trial judge to reject the appellants
    explanation given at trial because it was not believable and to use that
    finding in assessing the appellant's overall credibility. However, the trial
    judge went further and used the appellant's silence as a basis for finding
    her incredible.  That he was not entitled to do.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant had a constitutional right to remain silent during any part of
    the police interview.  That right was not extinguished simply because he
    chose to speak to the officer with respect to some matters and did not exercise
    his right to silence completely: see <i>R. v. Chambers</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R.
    1293, at pp. 1315-1317;<i> R. v. Marshall</i> (2006), 77 O.R. (3d) 81 (C.A.),
    at para. 82.  The negative inferences the trial judge drew against the appellant
    were significant and it cannot be said the verdict would have been the same
    had she not made this error.  This error alone would be sufficient to warrant
    appellate intervention.</p>
  <h3>IV.       DISPOSITION</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the foregoing reasons, I would allow the appeal, set aside the conviction
    on Count 1, and enter a verdict of acquittal on that Count.</p>
