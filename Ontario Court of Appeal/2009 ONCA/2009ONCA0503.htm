  <h2>I.          Introduction</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    litigation concerns a call for tenders by Her Majesty the Queen in Right
    of Ontario as represented by the Minister of Transportation (the “MTO”) for
    a major contract to perform roadwork on Highway 402 in the vicinity of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Sarnia,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario.  By judgment dated May 19, 2009, the application judge granted a
    declaration that a late bid by the respondent, Coco Paving (1990) Inc. (“
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Coco”), was submitted in compliance with the terms prescribed by the MTO
    tender documents in respect of the contract.  The judgment also provided
    that the Minister and the MTO “ought to accept”
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Coco’s bid and list it on the MTO bidders’ list for the contract. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants, the Bot Group, attack the judgment on several grounds.  Of the
    grounds raised, it is necessary for the disposition of this appeal to address
    only the appellants’ contention that the application judge erred by misinterpreting
    the terms of the MTO tender documents and by concluding that Coco’s bid was
    compliant with the MTO’s bid submission requirements.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    the following reasons, we conclude that the application judge misinterpreted
    the relevant provisions of the MTO tender documents.  As a result of this
    interpretive error, her declarations that
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Coco’s bid was compliant and that it should be considered by the MTO and
    listed on the MTO’s bidders’ list are tainted and cannot stand. </p>
  <h2>II.        Discussion</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    begin with this preliminary observation.  The analysis of whether Coco’s
    bid was compliant must proceed in recognition of the fundamental tendering
    law principle that no contractual duties arise between the tender-calling
    authority and a bidder unless and until what is termed under tendering law
    as “Contract A” is formed.  The formation of Contract A only occurs on the
    submission of a valid, that is, a compliant bid: see <i>R. v. Ron Engineering &amp; Construction
    (Eastern) Ltd.</i>, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 111, at para. 16; <i>M.J.B. Enterprises
    Ltd. v. Defence Construction (1951) Ltd.</i>, [1999] 1 S.C.R. 619, at paras.
    36 and 41.  As recently observed by the British Columbia Court of Appeal
    in <i>Hub Excavating Ltd. v. Orca Estates Ltd.</i>, 2009 BCSC 167, at paras.
    39 and 40, “[t]here is no free-standing duty of fairness in the bidding process
    independent of [the] contractual duty [arising on the formation of Contract
    A.]”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus,
    as a matter of tendering law, MTO owed Coco no contractual duty of fairness
    unless
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Coco submitted a compliant bid or the tender documents otherwise explicitly
    provided to the contrary.  In contrast, the MTO did owe contractual duties
    to the compliant bidders.  These duties obliged the MTO to act fairly in
    relation to the Bot Group and all other compliant bidders.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this case, under s. 4.4 of the MTO’s Instructions to Bidders, the MTO’s procedures
    for bid submissions required, in mandatory terms, that bidders complete “an
    on-line Summary Bid Submission Form”.  These forms were available to prospective
    bidders through the MTO computer servers.  Under this process, a candidate
    bidder downloaded a Summary Bid Submission Form to its own computer for the
    input of information.  Upon completion of the document, the form was to be
    submitted and received by the MTO servers before “Tender Closing” in order
    to qualify as a compliant bid.  The MTO’s Summary Bid Submission Form contained
    the following unambiguous warning: “This bid must be <i>received</i> by the
    MTO Servers (through the submit action) <i>before tender opening </i>at 03:00
    PM on 29-Apr-2009 to be considered” (emphasis added).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    addition to the warning contained in the MTO’s Summary Bid Submission Form,
    the first line of the MTO’s tender documents stipulated that “Tender Closing
    is 3:00:00 p.m. local (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Toronto) time, April 22, 2009”.  This date was later extended by the MTO
    to April 29, 2009.  The terms “Tender Closing” and “Tender Opening” are both
    defined under s. 1.12 of the Instructions to Bidders as “the last date and
    time that the Ministry will <i>receive</i> bids” (emphasis added).  Thus,
    to be eligible as a compliant bid, a bid had to be <i>received</i> by the
    MTO computer servers before 3:00:00 p.m. on April 29, 2009 (emphasis added).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    did not occur in respect of
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    Coco’s bid.  There is no dispute that
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Coco’s bid was first received by the MTO via the MTO’s electronic bid submission
    system at 3:28:05 p.m. on April 29, 2009, the extended date for the receipt
    of bids.  Another copy of the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Coco bid was received by the MTO via facsimile transmission at 3:58 p.m.
    on April 29.  Accordingly, since
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Coco’s bid was not received on or before 3:00 p.m. on April 29, its bid was
    non-compliant on its face.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    granting the declaratory relief sought by
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    Coco, the application judge made no mention of the provisions of the MTO
    Summary Bid Submission Form and the tender documents, above-quoted, in her
    reasons.  In our view, on a plain reading of these provisions, the MTO’s
    tender process for the contract precluded the consideration by the MTO of
    bids received after Tender Closing.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Importantly,
    and contrary to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Coco’s contention, the MTO tender documents do not expressly provide for
    the MTO to receive and consider late bids.  Nor do we think that such authority
    or discretion arises by necessary implication from the language of the tender
    documents.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    recognize that s. 11.1 of the tender documents authorizes the MTO, in its
    discretion, to “waive formalities as the interests of the Ministry may require”.  However,
    in the absence of clear language in s. 11.1 or elsewhere in the tender documents
    indicating that, in the discretion of the MTO, a late bid or a substantially
    non-compliant bid may be accepted, s. 11.1 cannot be construed so as to permit
    the acceptance of a bid that is submitted late.  This is particularly so
    where – as here – other compliant bids were received and where an expansive
    interpretation of the discretion afforded under s. 11.1 would result in the
    displacement of an otherwise compliant and likely successful bid.  To hold
    otherwise would sanction unfairness in, and distort the level playing field
    contemplated by, the MTO bidding process: see <i>NAC Constructors Ltd. v.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Alberta (Capital Region Wastewater Commission)</i> (2005), 10 B.L.R. (4<span style='font-family:&quot;Times New \(W1\)&quot;;
'>th</span>) 252, (Alta Q.B.), at paras. 47-50, aff’d 2005 ABCA 401.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    the timing of bid delivery is not a mere formality in the tendering process.  As
    emphasized by the appellants, bid closing time is sacrosanct in the competitive
    public tendering process.  As this court stated in <i>Bradscot (MCL) Ltd.
    v. Hamilton-Wentworth Catholic District School Board</i> (1999), 116 O.A.C.
    257, at para. 6: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The submission of a tender in compliance with tender
    instructions creates a unilateral contract between the general contractor
    and the owner.  This unilateral contract imposes rights and obligations on
    the parties intended to protect and promote the integrity of the tender system.  One
    obligation imposed on the owner is a duty of fairness to all tenderers.  A
    duty of fairness is needed to prevent abuse and to ensure a level playing
    field.  As Williams J.A. observed in <i>Vachon Construction Ltd. v. Cariboo
    (Regional District)</i>, (<i>sub nom</i>. <i>Bradscot (MCL) Ltd. v. Board
    of Education (Roman Catholic Separate) of Hamilton-Wentworth)</i>, 116 OA.C.
    257 44 C.L.R. (2d), 1, 42 O.R. (3d) 723:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>On the other side, the tendering process is,
    and must always be, a carefully controlled process, since the opportunity
    for abuse or distortion is ever present.  While that is not what happened
    in this case, the process must nonetheless be, and be seen to be fair to
    all bidders.  For that reason, the process is often attacked for technical
    reasons and the law has accordingly applied strict rules for any alteration
    in the process by both bidder and owner.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><i>A bid submitted after the tender deadline is
      invalid, and an owner that considers a late bid would breach its duty of
      fairness to the other tenderers</i>.  [Footnotes omitted; emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Strong
    public policy considerations underlie these controlling principles.  Confi-dence
    in the integrity of government bidding processes is a matter of considerable
    public importance.  The Ontario Road Builders’
    Association, an intervenor in this proceeding, put it aptly in its factum
    when referencing the holding in <i>Bradscot</i>.  The Association said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The tendering process is, and must always be, a
    carefully controlled process, since the opportunity for abuse or distortion
    is ever present.  Even in the absence of abuse or distortion, the process
    must nonetheless be and be seen to be fair to all bidders.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>….</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[A] bidder who submits its bid even a few minutes
    late has the potential to obtain a tremendous advantage over his competitors
    if it can obtain a last-minute lower bid from a subcontractor.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    courts have therefore recognized that the timing of bid submissions in public
    tender processes is critical.  Late bids can unfairly advantage the non-compliant
    bidder over the compliant bidders who met the bid submission requirements
    and erode the integrity of the bidding process.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    application judge does not appear to have factored these important considerations
    into her analysis of the MTO’s tender documents.  With respect, by failing
    to do so, the application judge erred.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span

    5 of the Instructions to Bidders thus provided for alternate bid submission
    procedures in the event of a computer system failure.  In the event of such
    a failure, and where specific conditions were met, these alternate procedures
    allowed bidders to submit bids by fax.  Where such failure was attributable
    to the bidder, s. 5.1 prescribed a window of 30 minutes prior to Tender Closing
    to trigger the alternate bid submission procedures.  But even under the alternate
    procedures, if triggered, bids received by the MTO after Tender Closing could
    not be considered.</p>

    Coco’s failure to contact the MTO help line prior to approximately 2:50 p.m.

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is common ground that the cause of
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    Coco’s late bid submission was some type of computer
    ‘glitch’. 
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Coco maintains that its bid was received late because of a malfunction in
    the MTO’s computer system.  This claim is vigorously contested.  The MTO
    led evidence before the application judge indicating that its computer servers
    were functioning properly at the relevant time.  The Bot Group relies on
    this evidence to argue that
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Coco’s bid, when first submitted, simply became stuck in an “internet traffic
    jam”.  The Bot Group emphasizes that other bidders were shown to have accessed
    the MTO computerized bidding system during the precise time interval when
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Coco claims that it was prevented, through no fault of its own, from doing
    so.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    application judge considered it unnecessary to determine the origins of the
    computer difficulties experienced by
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    Coco in submitting its bid.  What is clear, however, is that if a bidder’s
    computer system failed, the MTO’s help desk had to be contacted at least
    30 minutes before Tender Opening/Closing.  On Coco’s own evidence, it was
    not until about 2:40 p.m. on April 29, 2009, at the earliest, that
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Coco first attempted to access the MTO computerized bidding system.  Even
    accepting this evidence, the timing of this initial contact by Coco left
    little room for the MTO to reserve a dedicated fax line for receipt of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Coco’s bid before Tender Closing.</p>

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Coco relies on the fact that it contacted the MTO on April 28, 2009, the
    day prior to the day of Tender Closing, to request fax numbers from the MTO
    as a precaution against computer failure.  But there is no suggestion that
    at the time of the April 28 contact,
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Coco was experiencing or reported a computer failure of any kind.  Nor is
    there any evidence that
    <st1:place

    Coco requested or received a Summary Bid Submission Form on April 28 as a
    result of its telephone call to the MTO on that day.</p>

    said, we agree with the Bot Group’s submission that, unlike other bidders,
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Coco took a calculated risk in deciding to delay accessing the MTO electronic
    bidding system until after 2:30 p.m. on April 29, 2009.  It was open to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Coco, as it was to the other bidders, to submit its first bid well in advance
    of Tender Closing and to update it thereafter.  Unlike the other bidders,

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Relying
    on s. 22(1) of the <i>Electronic Commerce Act, 2000</i>, S.O. 2000, c. 17,
    Coco argues that its bid is presumed by operation of law to have been sent
    to the MTO when the bid entered an “information system” outside
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Coco’s control.  The effect of this presumption,
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Coco says, is that its bid was “sent” to the MTO at 2:50 p.m. on April 29,
    2009 – before Tender Closing.  We do not accept this submission.  </p>

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Coco.  Nor is there evidence of what happened to the bid that
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Coco attempted to send on-line before 3:00 p.m.  It may simply have been
    lost or stalled in ‘cyberspace’.  In any event, on this record, it is speculative
    to conclude that
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Coco’s bid entered MTO’s information system before 3:00 p.m.  Under the tender
    requirements, which repeatedly emphasized the time of the MTO’s <i>receipt</i> of
    a bid, this was critical.  Merely
    ‘sending’ a bid does not establish <i>receipt</i> by the MTO.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    with respect, we do not agree with the application judge’s holding that s.&nbsp;4.6
    of the MTO Instructions to Bidders operates to overcome the difficulties
    presented by the late submission of
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    Coco’s bid.  That provision reads:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>4.6       Upon submitting an on-line Summary Bid
    Submission Form, bidders will receive an on-line receipt notifying that the
    Ministry has successfully received the Summary Bid Submission Form.  Bidders
    not receiving an on-line receipt must contact the Ministry’s Help Desk at
    1-877-246-4600.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Nothing
    in s. 4.6 relieves against the timing of Tender Closing established under
    the tender documents.  Nor does s. 4.6 create an exception to the stipulation
    that a bidder’s Summary Bid Submission Form had to be received by the MTO
    before Tender Opening/Closing at 3:00 p.m. on April 29, 2009.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    contrary to the application judge’s view, the general language of s. 4.6
    is not concerned with alternate bid submission procedures.  That matter is
    dealt with in the specific language of s. 5 of the Instructions to Bidders.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section
    4.6 is merely directed at ensuring that a bidder who submitted an on-line
    Summary Bid Submission Form and did not receive confirmation of receipt of
    that form from the MTO had the means to obtain such confirmation (an MTO
    receipt) by contacting the MTO’s help desk.  Although we agree with the application
    judge’s implicit suggestion that the language of s. 4.6 would benefit from
    clarification, especially concerning its interplay with Article 5 of the
    tender documents, there is nothing in s. 4.6 to support the conclusion that
    it is intended to override the specific provisions of the tender documents
    relating to the deadline and process for the MTO’s receipt of bid submissions.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    we note that s. 4.6 of the Instructions to Bidders forms part of Article
    4.0, entitled “Electronic Bid Submission Procedures”.  Section 4.6 must be
    read in the context of Article 4.0 as a whole.  Article 4.0 in fact reiterates
    that bids had to be received by the MTO prior to Tender Opening.  Section
    4.5 reads in part:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Bidders can submit a revised on-line Summary Bid
    Sub-mission Form <i>up until Tender Opening.  The Ministry will only consider
