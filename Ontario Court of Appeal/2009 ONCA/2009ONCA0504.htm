  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Simmons J.A.:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>      </span>The
    appellant appeals from a disposition of the Ontario Review Board made on
    March 14, 2008 ordering that he be detained at the minimum secure unit of
    the Northeast Mental Health Centre--North Bay Campus. The disposition arose
    from a hearing on March 10, 2008 that was held pursuant to an endorsement
    of this court dated January 25, 2008.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='line-height:
200%;'>      Both the appellant and Amicus Curiae appointed to assist the court
      raised issues on appeal. I will deal with their issues in turn.<b>&nbsp;</b></span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><b>I.          The Appellants' Grounds of Appeal</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>      </span>The
    appellant submits that the Board erred in admitting the Hospital Report and
    his treating psychiatrist's report as exhibits at the hearing because both
    documents refer to charges against him that were stayed, withdrawn or dismissed.
    I disagree.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>      </span>In
    my view, the statement in this court's January 25, 2008 endorsement that “[T]he
    Board's assessment of risk cannot take into consideration charges that did
    not result in convictions”, related to the Board's reference in its decision
    to the appellant's C.P.I.C. records and therefore was limited to the Board's
    direct review of the C.P.I.C. records. It did not bar the Board from attributing
    such weight as it deemed appropriate to actuarial risk assessment tools that
    take account of all entries on an accused's criminal record.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>      </span>In
    any event, on the record before the Board in this case, there was a clear
    evidentiary basis for relying on the risk assessment tools even though they
    take account of such entries. <span
style='line-height:200%;'>Finally, I note that in setting out a statement of
    the appellant's criminal record in its reasons, the Board complied with this
    court's January 25, 2008 endorsement.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>      </span>The
    appellant also claims that the disposition is unreasonable and not supported
    by the evidence. I will address this ground when dealing with the submissions
    of the Amicus.</p>
  <p align=left style='text-align:left'><b>II.        </b><b>The Issues raised
      by Amicus Curiae</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>      </span>The
    first issue raised by the Amicus is that the six months taken by the Board
    to issue its reasons for disposition in this case is unreasonable and has
    resulted in prejudice to the appellant. <span
style='line-height:200%;'>The Board issued its disposition on March 14, 2008
    in relation to the hearing held on March 10, 2008, but did not deliver its
    reasons until September 25, 2008. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>      </span>Particularly
    because of the Board's statutory mandate to conduct annual review hearings
    of the status of persons found not criminally responsible and because of
    an NCR accused's statutory right of appeal, it is essential that the Board
    be in a position to issue its reasons for disposition in a timely way. This
    would generally mean much more quickly than within six months of a hearing.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>      </span>As
    pointed out by Mr. Davies in his able submissions, particularly where an
    NCR accused is detained it is important that he or she understand both the
    reasons for the detention and what the Board thinks should be done to obtain
    a more favourable disposition. Similarly, it is important that the Hospital
    have a full appreciation of the scope of the disposition and how the Board
    intends it should be implemented.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span>            </span>That
    said, I am unable to discern any basis for awarding any form of remedy on
    the facts of this case. Nothing in the Board's reasons points to the existence
    of any error or oversight in the formal disposition that was issued. Moreover,
    there is nothing in the Board's reasons to suggest that they are not a true
    articulation of its reasoning. Albeit delayed, it is anticipated that the
    appellant’s next annual review will now be held promptly, in August of this
    year. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    like the panel of this court in <i>R. v. Roberts</i>, [2007] O.J. No. 4016,
    I would urge the Board to take all necessary steps to ensure that reasons
    are delivered forthwith. In <i>Roberts</i>, this court said:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'>Although the Board gave
    its decision in a timely fashion, it did not provide reasons for some six
    months. It is crucial to the process that the reasons be made available as
    soon as reasonably possible. We intend no criticism as we are unaware of
    the circumstances that caused the lengthy delay in the delivery of reasons
    in the matter. We urge the Board to take all necessary steps to ensure that
    reasons are delivered forthwith.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Absent
    exceptional circumstances, I would suggest a range of three to four months
    as a reasonable outside limit for the release of such reasons. However, for
    the reasons outlined above, I would not give effect to this ground of appeal
    in the present circumstances. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second issue raised by the Amicus is that the Board's refusal to grant a
    conditional discharge is unreasonable because it is premised on errors in
    law and fails to give adequate weight to the appellant's history of good
    behaviour and stated willingness to comply with any conditions imposed in
    a conditional discharge. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    would not give effect to this ground of appeal either. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    its reasons, the Board noted the appellant’s longstanding lack of insight
    into his mental illness, his substance abuse disorder and his need for medications,
    as well as a recent history of temporary non-compliance with the monitoring
    conditions in a disposition order. In the light of these circumstances, the
    Board concluded that if the appellant is to live in the community, the protection
    of the public requires that the Hospital be in a position to approve his
    housing and that, at least initially “a significant degree of supervision”
    would be required. These requirements can only be satisfied under the authority
    of a detention order.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
    on my review of the record, the Board’s conclusions in this regard were supported
    by the evidence. Accordingly, they are entitled to deference from this court. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Board also said that, because of the appellant's pattern of testing limits,
    the Hospital needed to be in a position to return the appellant to the Hospital
    expeditiously should the appellant not comply with the conditions of his
    order while living in the community. Although it is true that an NCR accused
    on a conditional discharge can be returned to the Hospital in the event of
    a breach or anticipated breach of condition, I am not satisfied that this
    statement amounted to an error in law. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where
    an NCR accused is on a detention order, a return to the Hospital can be effected
    by Hospital staff in the event of a deterioration in condition without involving
    a peace officer or invoking civil processes. Having regard to the potential
    need to return the appellant in the event he fails to fully comply with his
    conditions, I see nothing unreasonable about the Board's decision </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    I am not persuaded that the Board's statement that a condition ordering the
    appellant to take psychiatric treatment cannot be imposed in this case is
    an error in law. If, as Mr. Davies submitted, there is a distinction to be
    made between the appellant’s ability to consent to treatment and his ability
    to consent to a condition in a disposition order requiring treatment, it
    is a distinction without a difference in this case, where the condition in
    question would effectively involve consenting to treatment. In any event,
    on my reading of the Board's reasons, its real concern was the impracticality
    of making an order with which there is no reason to believe the appellant
    will comply. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>    <b>III.       Disposition</b></p>
