  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is an appeal from the judgment of Lofchik J. dated May 16, 2008 and September
    5, 2008 (the “Judgment”).  In the Judgment, The Personal Insurance Company
    of Canada/La Personnelle Compagnie D’Assurance Du Canada (“Personal”) was
    ordered to pay the plaintiff, Jokelee Vanderkop, income replacement benefits
    (“IRBs”) pursuant to the <i>Statutory Accident Benefits Schedule </i>(“<i>SABS</i>”),
    without reduction for possible long term disability benefits (“LTD”).</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>  </span>The
    facts in this case are not in dispute.  They are set out both in an agreed
    statement of fact and in the reasons for decision below.  There is no need
    to recite them here save in summary form.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Vanderkop was seriously injured in a car accident on February 17, 1997.  At
    that time, she was 44 years old and worked for the Wellington County Board
    of Education as a secondary school teacher.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Personal
    insured Ms. Vanderkop under a motor vehicle policy.  The policy included
    the standard accident benefits afforded accident victims pursuant to <i>SABS</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Vanderkop was also insured under a group policy in effect between her employer
    and the Manufacturers Life Insurance Company (“Manulife Policy”).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Manulife Policy included provision for LTD, which obligated Manulife to pay
    a monthly loss of income benefits provided eligibility and entitlement requirements
    were met.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Vanderkop initially returned to work but had to use sick credits to complete
    the school term.  In July 1997, believing that she qualified for LTD, she
    applied to Manulife for LTD but her application was denied.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Vanderkop attempted to return to work in February 1998.  With the assistance
    of her principal and others, she made it to the end of that term but was
    unable to ever return to work again.  She used her remaining sick leave credits
    to November 17, 1998.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Personal
    paid no IRBs for the ensuing 112 weeks based on its position that Ms. Vanderkop
    did not qualify for them.  Eventually, it admitted that Ms. Vanderkop met
    the <i>SABS</i> test for payment of IRBs from, at least, the 104 week mark.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    June 28, 1999, Ms. Vanderkop issued a statement of claim against Manulife
    in which she sought to recover LTD from September 1997.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    November 27, 2002, Ms. Vanderkop attended a private mediation with Manulife,
    Personal and the defendant in her tort action arising from the accident.  At
    the mediation, Ms. Vanderkop entered into a settlement with Manulife in which
    she released all entitlement to past, present and future benefits under the
    Manulife Policy for $57,500.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    negotiations at the mediation, the issue of co-ordination of benefits was
    at the forefront.  Personal did nothing at the mediation to encourage or
    induce Ms. Vanderkop to enter into the Manulife settlement or that could
    be reasonably interpreted by Ms. Vanderkop to mean that it approved the Manulife
    settlement.  However, nor did it tell Ms. Vanderkop that it would take the
    position that it was entitled to reduce future payment of IRBs, to the point
    of extinguishment, by virtue of the fact of her settlement with Manulife. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Pursuant
    to s. 7 of <i>SABS</i>, Personal is entitled to deduct Manulife LTD payments
    from IRBs otherwise payable by it only if:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>(a)  Ms. Vanderkop had been paid LTD, or </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>(b)  she failed to apply for LTD.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    7 (1) 1 reads as follows:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>7.  (1)  Despite subsection 6(1) but subject to
    subsections 6(2) to (6), the weekly amount of an income replacement benefit
    payable to a person shall be the lesser of the following amounts:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>      1.   The amount determined under subsection
    6(1), reduced by,</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>i.   net weekly payments for loss of income
    that are being received by the person as a result of the accident under the
    laws of any jurisdiction or under any income continuation benefit plan, and</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>ii.  net weekly payments for loss of income
    that are not being received by the person but are available to the person
    as a result of the accident under the laws of any jurisdiction or under any
    income continuation benefit plan, unless the person has applied to receive
    the payments for loss of income.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    the mediation, Personal refused to pay IRBs to Ms. Vanderkop even though
    she met the test for entitlement because of the settlement that she made
    with Manulife.  It contended that it could deduct any LTD payments that <i>might</i> have
    been payable had Ms. Vanderkop successfully litigated with Manulife (the “hypothetical<i> </i>payment<i>s</i>”).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Ms.
    Vanderkop sued Personal for the IRBs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Manulife
    was not present at trial.  No witness from Manulife was called to testify.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Personal
    called no witnesses at trial.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found in favour of Ms. Vanderkop and ordered Personal to pay
    IRBs to her.  He held that Personal had the onus to prove that settlement
    of the LTD benefits claim against Manulife was unreasonable in all the circumstances.  He
    found that Personal had failed to establish “beyond dispute” that Ms. Vanderkop
    was entitled to the hypothetical payments and to the quantum of those hypothetical
    payments had the settlement not been entered into.  He held that Personal’s
    failure to lead evidence to demonstrate that, if the settlement with Manulife
    could be set aside, Ms. Vanderkop would be entitled to LTD was fatal to a
    claim to deductibility of those benefits.  He rejected the submission that
    the legislature would, without clear wording, oblige an injured party caught
    between two insurance companies to pursue litigation where the only benefit
    of the litigation would accrue to the automobile insurer.  </p>

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE ISSUE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Personal’s
    appeal is based on its submission that the trial judge erred in finding that
    it was not entitled to a reduction for LTD from the quantum of IRBs otherwise
    payable to Ms. Vanderkop.  Specifically, it argues that the trial judge erred
    in finding that LTD was not available to Ms. Vanderkop and that she had applied
    for such benefits within the meaning of s. 7 (1) 1 (ii) of the <i>SABS</i>.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    accept neither submission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> There
    are two issues of interpretation raised on appeal.  First, the appellant
    argues that by entering into a settlement with Manulife regarding her LTD
    claim, Ms. Vanderkop should be treated as, in effect, voluntarily withdrawing
    her application for LTD benefits.  As a result, the appellant says, from
    the date of settlement forward she cannot be taken to have “applied” for
    LTD benefits within the meaning of s. 7(1) 1(ii).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    disagree.  Ms. Vanderkop applied for LTD benefits and they were denied.  Thereafter,
    Manulife persisted in that denial of benefits by resisting and defending
    her action against it.  In these circumstances, Ms. Vanderkop did not abandon
    or withdraw her application for LTD benefits.  She merely compromised her
    claim as a result of mediation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the appellant argues LTD benefits were
    “available” to Ms. Vanderkop within the meaning of s. 7(1) 1 (ii) of <i>SABS</i>.  Again,
    we disagree.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>IRBs
    are to be reduced by LTD being received as a result of the accident.  The
    legislation does not entitle Personal to set off hypothetical benefits applied
    for but refused.  Ms. Vanderkop was not in receipt of LTD.  As Manulife had
    denied her claim, she cannot be described as entitled to the payment of LTD.  That
    is, LTD was not “available” to her.  To treat LTD as being available would
    effectively oblige an insured to litigate with their collateral benefits
    insurer, at their own risk and expense, for the benefit and at the discretion
    of, their accident benefits insurer.   In our view, <i>SABS </i> places no
    such obligation on an insured. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    said that, we wish to note Ms. Vanderkop’s concession that Personal could
    have recouped the $57,500 paid to her by Manulife, had it followed the necessary
    statutory procedures.  That is, she has conceded that after the mediation,
    had Personal paid Ms. Vanderkop the IRBs to which she was entitled, it could
    have deducted the $57,500 from those ongoing payments in the manner permitted
    by the legislation. It chose not to.   </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>DISPOSITION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the appeal is dismissed with costs to the respondent fixed at $15,000, inclusive
    of disbursements and GST.</p>
