    amendment.  For the reasons that follow, I agree with both contentions.  I

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>First,
      Juriansz J.A. held that whether the proposed amendment seeking damages
      for breach of warranty arise other than from the practice of professional
      engineering is, at the very least, a genuine issue for trial.  Second,
      he held that discoverability of the claim is a genuine issue for trial.  Thus,
      if the relevant limitation period is six years, that cracks in the casing
      were first discovered in April 2000 and the motion to amend was not brought
      until June 2006 may not statutorily bar the amendment.  It is a question
      for trial whether the cracking before June 2000 was significant enough
      to trigger the running of the limitation period.  </span></p>

      decision of this court in <i>Mazzuca v. Silvercreek Pharmacy Ltd</i>. (2001),
      56 O.R. (3d) 768, is directly on point.  The plaintiff, Ms. Mazzuca, operated
      a ladies clothing and lingerie store.  A fire occurred next door at the
      Silvercreek Pharmacy.  The fire damaged the clothing and lingerie store.  Ms.
      Mazzuca sued Silvercreek for damages to her inventory and for loss of income
      while her store was being repaired.  During discoveries, Ms. Mazzuca determined
      that her company, La Gondola Ltd., owned the store and the business and
      that it, not she, was the proper plaintiff.  She moved to amend her statement
      of claim to substitute her company as the named plaintiff.</span></p>

      opposed the amendment on the ground that the accountants for Ms. Mazzucas
      company had destroyed business records that might have assisted in Silvercreeks
      defence of the damages claim.  These documents, however, were destroyed
      three years before the action was started.  The motion judge, Molloy J.,
      granted the amendment and her decision was upheld by our court.  On the
      question of prejudice caused by the destruction of the documents, Cronk
      J.A. wrote at para. 65:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I agree with the motions judges conclusion that,
    although the destruction of the source documents relied upon for preparation
    of the financial statements conceivably might give rise to some element of
    prejudice, this prejudice would have existed, in any event, if the action
    had named La&nbsp;Gondola Ltd. as plaintiff from the outset.  I also agree
    with her observation that had the proper parties been named at the time of
    the commencement of the action, Silvercreeks position in respect of the
    missing records would be precisely the same as it is today.  This cannot
    be viewed as prejudice arising from the requested amendment.</p>

lang=EN-US>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>However,
      the expiry of a limitation period before a motion to amend was brought
      might provide the necessary link.  An amendment to assert a new cause of
      action after the limitation period has run is presumed to be prejudicial
      to the opposing party.  The opposing party could justifiably argue that
      the prejudice arose from the proposed amendment.  That argument is not
      available to the defendants in this case because whether the limitation
      period has expired is a genuine issue for trial.</span></p>

      a motion to amend before the expiry of a limitation period could give rise
      to prejudice that would result from the amendment.  Take this example.  A
      defendant has given advice to a plaintiff on two separate transactions.  The
      plaintiff sues for negligent misrepresentation on the first transaction,
      but not the second.  The defendant then destroys records pertaining to
      the second transaction in the ordinary course of its business.  Or, the
      defendant fails to obtain the evidence of a material witness to the second
      transaction and the witness unexpectedly dies.  If the plaintiff later
      seeks to amend its statement of claim to sue on the second transaction,
      the defendant may legitimately contend that it altered its position in
      reliance on the plaintiffs claim as originally framed.  In this example,
      the destroyed records or the death of the witness may be items of non-compensable
      prejudice that would result from the proposed amendment.  </span></p>

      of this sort occurred here.  The defendants did not change their position
