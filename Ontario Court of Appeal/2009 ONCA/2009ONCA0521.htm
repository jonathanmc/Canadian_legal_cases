  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is an appeal from an order dismissing a motion to vary spousal and child
    support obligations contained in minutes of settlement, entered following
    several days of trial.  The appellant also seeks leave to appeal the costs
    award.</p>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US>Spousal Support</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant’s motion to vary support was based on the fact that the respondent
    remarried and was being supported by her new husband, which the appellant
    claims amounted to a material change in circumstances justifying a variation.  The
    minutes of settlement provided for a review of support in five years time
    and also provided for review on the basis of a material change in circumstances.  The
    minutes of settlement were silent as to any change in support in the event
    of the respondent's remarriage or cohabitation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the motion judge’s findings, which were amply supported by the
    evidence, constitute an insurmountable hurdle for the appellant on this appeal.  The
    motion judge found that at the time that the minutes of settlement were entered
    into, the appellant knew that the respondent “was in a serious relationship
    that was heading toward marriage.”  She also found that “the wife laid her
    relationship on the table” and that it was evident
    “that her relationship with [her now husband] was serious, longstanding,
    and likely headed toward marriage.”  The motion judge found that the appellant
    must have factored in the possibility of the respondent’s remarriage when
    he signed the minutes of settlement.  The motion judge further found that “the
    husband has failed to demonstrate a material change in circumstances; he
    not only foresaw the possibility of remarriage but subjectively believed
    it was likely, if not certain.  He thus must be taken to a have accounted
    for it when negotiating spousal support.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge concluded that the parties had
    “clearly directed their minds to the very issue of a variation” and that
    the appellant had not asked for a term that spousal support would be reviewed
    or reduced upon remarriage or cohabitation.  Instead, he had accepted the
    term providing for review after five years.  As the motion judge observed,
    while in retrospect this may seem disadvantageous to the appellant, he had
    actually received the assurance of a review after five years, which might
    well have shortened the duration of spousal support to which the respondent
    would otherwise have been entitled.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not accept the submission that the appellant lacked sufficient information
    at the time that the minutes of settlement were negotiated to foreclose him
    from now asserting a material change as a result of the respondent’s remarriage.  The
    respondent’s new husband was a close friend of the appellant’s.  The appellant
    believed him to be a wealthy man and also believed at the time the minutes
    of settlement were negotiated that he was already providing financial support
    to the respondent. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree with the motion judge that as the prospect of the respondent’s remarriage
    to a wealthy man was known at the time the minutes of settlement were entered,
    the fact that she did remarry cannot be relied upon as a basis for a variation:
    see <i>Willick v. Willick</i>, [1994] 3 S.C.R. 670; <i>L. G. v. G.B.</i> [1995]
    3 S.C.R. 370.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, this case is distinguishable from <i>Marinangeli v. Marinangeli</i> (2003),
    66 O.R. (3d) 40 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  That case involved a stock option.  Although the precise value that the
    stock option would have in the future could not be determined, it would have
    been possible at the time of the settlement to give it a present value.  The
    rationale for finding that the subsequent substantial gain realized by the
    husband constituted a material change was that he had failed to disclose
    the details necessary to permit the wife to assess its present value at the
    time of the settlement.  Here, the prospect of remarriage could not be valued.  There
    were unknown facts, including if and when the respondent might remarry and
    what financial consequences might flow from marriage but, as the motion judge
    found, the respondent had “laid her relationship on the table” and the appellant
    entered the minutes of settlement with full knowledge that it was likely
    that she would remarry.</p>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US>Child Support</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    we agree with the appellant that the motion judge’s order that he pay one
    half of the total nanny costs failed to take into account the respondents’ contribution
    to the nanny costs, the operative provision of the judgment, paragraph 8,
    accurately quantifies the actual payment required from the appellant by way
    of child support. </p>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US>Costs</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    see no error in the motion judge’s assessment of the costs of the motion.  She
    was entitled to take into account the fact that the bulk of the motion concerned
    support, which was also the issue on which the appellant was unsuccessful.  In
    view of the very reasonable offer to settle made by the respondent, the quantum
    of costs ordered was entirely reasonable. </p>
  <h4><i><span lang=EN-US>Conclusion</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    we dismiss the appeal and deny leave to appeal costs.  The respondent is
    entitled to her costs of this appeal fixed at $10,000 inclusive of disbursements
    and GST.</p>
