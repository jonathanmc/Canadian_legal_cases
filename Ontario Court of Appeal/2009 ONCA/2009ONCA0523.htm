  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents were charged with violating s. 84(1) of the <i>Highway Traffic
    Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. H.8.  That section prohibits driving or operating
    a vehicle in such a dangerous or unsafe condition as to endanger any person.  Section
    84(1.1) provides that if a commercial motor vehicle has a critical defect “as
    prescribed by regulation” it is deemed to be in such a dangerous or unsafe
    condition as to endanger any person.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial the respondents’ commercial motor vehicle was shown to have defects
    which are designated by regulation as “a critical defect for the purposes
    of s. 82.1 of the <i>Act</i>.”  There is no counterpart regulation designating
    the defects in the respondent’s vehicle as critical defects for the purposes
    of s. 82 of the <i>Act</i>. There was no other evidence that the respondent’s
    vehicle was in such a dangerous or unsafe condition as to endanger any person.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents were acquitted at trial because the trial judge concluded that
    the regulation defining critical defects for the purposes of s. 82.1 means
    what it says, and does not apply to s. 84 of the Act.  That decision was
    upheld on appeal.  With leave, the Crown appeals to this court.  For the
    reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    section of the Act under which the respondents were charged has been in the
    legislation for a number of years and reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>84. (1) No person shall drive or operate or permit
    the driving or operation upon a highway of a vehicle, a street car or vehicles
    that in combination are in such a <u>dangerous or unsafe condition as to
    endanger any person</u>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    82 has also been in the Act<i> </i>for a number of years and deals with vehicles
    found to be “in a dangerous or unsafe condition”.  Sections 82(2) and (5)
    permit a police officer or other officer to order a vehicle found to be in
    a dangerous or unsafe condition removed from the highway and not operated
    until placed in a safe condition.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    February 2, 1998, a new regime for impounding critically defective commercial
    vehicles came into force through the addition to the Act<i> </i>of s. 82.1.  Section
    82.1(6) says this: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If the police officer or officer appointed for
    carrying out the provisions of this Act finds that the commercial motor vehicle
    or trailer has one or more critical defect, the vehicle shall be <u>deemed
    to have been found to be in dangerous or unsafe condition under section 82,</u> but
    instead of exercising the powers set out in subsections 82(2) and (5), he
    or she shall forthwith,</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a)       notify the Registrar of the findings
    or cause the Registrar to be notified;</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(b)       seize the number plates of the vehicle
    that has the critical defect or defects and remove its vehicle inspection
    sticker or comparable device issued by another jurisdiction; and</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(c)       detain the vehicle that has the critical
    defect or defects until the Registrar issues an order under subsection (7).  [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    82.1(37) provides the following power to make regulations:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Lieutenant Governor in Council may make regulations,</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a)       prescribing what constitutes a critical
    defect;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the same date, February 2, 1998, O. Reg. 512/97 came into force.  It is entitled “Suspension
    and Impoundment of Commercial Motor Vehicles for Critical Defects Under s.
    82.1 of The Act”.  Section 7(2) of that regulation defines the kinds of defects
    in a brake system that constitute a critical defect for the purposes of s.
    82.1.  In part, it says:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>A commercial motor vehicle or trailer, if the trailer
    is required by subsection 64(5) of the Act to have brakes, equipped with
    an air brake system other than an air-over-hydraulic brake system <u>has
    a critical defect for the purposes of section 82.1</u> of the Act if one
    or more of the following defects is present on more than 50 per cent of the
    wheel brakes of the vehicle.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>…</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>4.  The push rod travel out of the service
    brake chamber is ¼ inch (6.3 mm) or more beyond the measurement listed in
    Column 2 of Schedule 1 for the type of chamber listed in Column 1 of Schedule
    1 if the brake is cam or disc type.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Effective
    the same day, February 2, 1998, s. 84(1.1) was added to s. 84, the offence
    section set out above.  It reads:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If a commercial motor vehicle or trailer has one
    or more critical defect, as prescribed by regulation, it shall be deemed
    to be <u>in such a dangerous or unsafe condition as to endanger any person</u>.  [Emphasis
    added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    facts on which the prosecution was based are not in dispute.  On July 20,
    2006, the respondent Randy Banning was operating a tractor and two-axle trailer
    owned by the respondent Quality Carriers Inc. on Highway 401 near
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    London,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario.  There is no doubt that this is a commercial motor vehicle for the
    purposes of the Act.  Pursuant to instructions, Mr. Banning pulled the vehicle
    into a weigh station where it was inspected by a Ministry of Transportation
    officer.  The officer found that, for all four brakes on the trailer, the
    push rod travel out of the service brake chamber exceeded that permitted
    by s. 7(2)(4) of O. Reg. 512/97.  As a result, the trailer was impounded
    for 15 days under s. 82.1 of the Act.  Thereafter, both the driver and the
    owner were charged under s. 84 of the Act.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    trial, there was evidence of the push rod travel defects in the brakes, but
    no evidence that this actually affected the braking capacity of the vehicle.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Justice of the Peace concluded that, as a matter of statutory interpretation,
    a defect deemed by regulation to be a critical defect for the purposes of
    s. 82.1 of the Act is not thereby deemed to be a critical defect for the
    purposes of s. 84(1.1).  There being no other evidence that the vehicle was
    dangerous or unsafe, she acquitted both respondents.  Her decision was upheld
    by the Ontario Court of Justice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this court, the Crown submits that O. Reg. 512/97 must be taken to apply
    to s. 84(1.1) as well as to s. 82.1 and that since the vehicle in this case
    had a critical defect as prescribed by that regulation, the respondent should
    have been convicted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown argues that this is the plain meaning of s. 84(1.1), which encompasses
    any defect defined by regulation as a critical defect. That includes the
    push rod travel defects found on this vehicle. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    also says that this is consistent with the legislative intent that such defects
    would carry two sanctions, namely vehicle impoundment under s. 82.1 and conviction
    under s. 84(1) and (1.1).  It says that this is evident from the fact that
    s. 82.1 and s. 84(1.1) came into force simultaneously and from the record
    of the proceedings of the Legislature at the time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    also argues that without such an interpretation the same phrase, namely “critical
    defect”, would carry different meanings in s. 82.1 and s. 84.(1.1) contrary
    to the rule of construction favouring consistent expression.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition it says there would be a gap in the legislative scheme because with
    no other prescription by regulation of what constitutes a critical defect,
    s. 84(1.1) would be rendered meaningless.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    and in the alternative, the Crown says that the regulation making authority
    given by s. 82.1(37)(a) requires the Lieutenant Governor in Council to prescribe
    for all purposes what constitutes a critical defect and that the attempt
    to confine the prescription to s. 82.1 should be excised from the regulation
    as a limit the LGIC could not impose.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view these arguments cannot succeed.  Most obviously, the plain meaning
    of O. Reg. 512/97 does not permit it.  Section 7(2) of that regulation explicitly
    provides that it prescribes what is to be a critical defect “for the purposes
    of s. 82.1 of the Act”.  The title of the regulation itself (“Suspension
    and Impoundment of Commercial Motor Vehicles for Critical Defects Under s.
    82.1 of The Act”) confirms this.  This language can only mean that the prescription
    of what is a critical defect applies just to s. 82.1 of the Act.  That was
    the clear intention of the Lieutenant Governor in Council.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    there is nothing in the language of s. 84(1.1) to suggest that the intention
    of the Legislature was to have what was prescribed by regulation as a critical
    defect for s. 82.1 also be a critical defect for s. 84(1.1).  Quite the reverse.  Under
    s. 82.1(6) a critical defect causes a vehicle to be deemed in a dangerous
    or unsafe condition. Under s. 84(1.1), on the other hand, a critical defect
    causes a vehicle to be deemed in such a dangerous or unsafe condition <u>as
    to endanger any person</u>.  This suggests a legislative intent that a critical
    defect under s. 84(1.1) is something more than a critical defect under s.
    82.1.  In other words, they are not to be equated.  Nor does a reading of
    Hansard, where the focus was entirely on the new scheme for impoundment and
    not the offence provisions, suggest a legislative intent that the same conduct
    should attract both the sanctions of impoundment and conviction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    providing that O. Reg. 512/97 applies only to s. 82.1, the Lieutenant Governor
    in Council acted consistently with the legislative intention reflected in
    s. 82.1 and s.&nbsp;84(1.1).  That intention is that, unlike s. 82.1(6),
    s. 84(1.1) encompasses serious critical defects sufficient to render a vehicle
    in such a dangerous or unsafe condition as to endanger any person.  The differing
    purposes of s. 82.1 and s. 84(1.1) explain why the prescribed list of critical
    defects for one cannot be taken as the prescribed list for the other.  It
    also explains why the regulation does not contravene the rule favouring consistent
    expression.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is true that this creates a gap in the legislative scheme.  There is no regulation
    prescribing what is a critical defect for the purposes of s. 84(1.1).  However,
    that does not render the offence section unworkable.  Section 84(1) has operated
    for many years without s. 84(1.1).  Moreover, if the absence of a regulation
    applicable to s. 84(1.1) is considered a gap, it is not the role of the courts
    to determine how it should be filled.  See <i>Beattie v. National Frontier
    Insurance Co.</i> (2003), 68 O.R. (3d) 60 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), at para. 18.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    I do not think that the regulation making authority given by s. 82.1(37)(a)
    limits the Lieutenant Governor in Council to writing a single prescription
    of what constitutes a critical defect that must apply to all sections of
    the Act.  The subsection does not say so.  It simply says that the Lieutenant
    Governor in Council may make regulations prescribing what constitutes a critical
    defect.  This constitutes a delegation by the Legislature of a sphere of
    legislative authority in permissive terms, which the Lieutenant Governor
    in Council can exercise in whole, in part or not at all.  Here it has done
    so but only for the purposes of s. 82.1, something it was perfectly entitled
    to do. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    summary, I conclude that the regulation relied on by the Crown does not apply
    to s. 84(1.1).  Given the absence of other evidence, the charges were properly
    dismissed.  The appeal is dismissed.</p>
