    appellant was convicted of the sexual assault of S.V. and sentenced to an
    18-month conditional sentence, followed by three years probation.  He appeals
    from his conviction on the grounds that he was denied the effective assistance
    of counsel at trial,  the trial judge erred by misapprehending the defence
    expert evidence at trial, and the trial judge further erred in her assessment
    of S.V.s credibility.  For the reasons that follow, we conclude that the
    appeal must be allowed. </p>
  <h2>I.          BACKGROUND</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant and S.V. became close friends at university during the fall of
    2003.  During the mid-winter school break the following year, S.V. planned
    to go snowboarding in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Collingwood,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario.  On February 18, 2004, while enroute to Collingwood, she stopped
    at the appellants home in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Barrie for a pre-arranged visit.  S.V. and the appellant had dinner with
    two of the appellants friends, R.D. and K.K., and the group then spent several
    hours drinking at Fitzys, a local bar, with a third friend of the appellant,
    D.C.  S.V. claimed that before going to Fitzys bar, the group went to a
    Tim Hortons restaurant and a pool hall with an individual named John.  The
    appellant denied that they had attended at the restaurant or the pool hall
    or that they had been with someone called John.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    the end of the evening, S.V. stayed overnight at the appellants home instead
    of continuing on to Collingwood.  As they had apparently done in the past
    as platonic
    friends, S.V. and the appellant slept together in the same bed.  S.V. alleged
    that during the night, the appellant engaged in oral sex and unprotected
    sexual intercourse with her despite her protestations and lack of consent.  The
    appellant admitted the oral sex but claimed that it was consensual.  He denied
    that any sexual intercourse had occurred.  The trial judge accepted S.V.s
    version of events and convicted the appellant of sexual assault.  She imposed
    an 18-month sentence, to be served in the community, followed by three years probation.</p>
  <h2>II.        ISSUES</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    are three issues on appeal:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Was
    the appellant denied the effective assistance of counsel at trial?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Did

    Joseph A. Zadra, a urologist?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>(3)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Did
    the trial judge err in her assessment of S.V.s credibility?</p>
  <h2>III.       ANALYSIS</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Of
    the issues raised by the appellant, we consider it necessary for the disposition
    of this appeal to address only some aspects of his claim of ineffective assistance
    of trial counsel and his allegation that the trial judge misapprehended the
    defence expert evidence led at trial.</p>
  <h2>(1)       Ineffective Assistance of Trial Counsel</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>An
    accused who is represented by counsel at trial is entitled to receive effective
    legal assistance.  This entitlement is embodied in the constitutional protections
    afforded by ss. 7 and 11(d) of the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>.  In <i>R.
    v. Joanisse</i> (1995), 102 C.C.C. (3d) 35, leave to appeal to S.C.C. refused,
    [1996] S.C.C.A. No. 347, at p. 57, Doherty J.A. of this court explained:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Where counsel fails to provide effective representation,
    the fairness of the trial, measured both by reference to the reliability
    of the verdict and the adjudicative fairness of the process used to arrive
    at the verdict, suffers.  In some cases the result will be a miscarriage
    of justice.  This court is under a statutory obligation to quash convictions
    which are the product of a miscarriage of justice: <i>Criminal Code</i>,
    s.&nbsp;686(1)(a)(iii).  The accused who is the victim of a miscarriage of
    justice is entitled to at least a new trial.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    burden of establishing ineffective representation at trial warranting appellate
    intervention rests on the accused.  This burden is not easily discharged.  Claims
    of ineffective representation by trial counsel are approached with caution
    by appellate courts.  As Doherty J.A. observed in <i>Joanisse</i>, at p.
    58: It would be a rare case where, after conviction, some aspect of defence
    counsels performance could not be subjected to legitimate criticism.  Appeals
    are not intended to be forensic autopsies of counsels performance at trial.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span

    court has adopted a three-stage approach to the scrutiny of ineffective representation
    claims.  Under this approach, in order to succeed in a claim of ineffective
    assistance of counsel at trial, an appellant must establish:  (i) the facts
    on which the claim of incompetence is based; (ii) that the representation
    provided by trial counsel was incompetent (the performance component of the
    test); and (iii) that the incompetent representation resulted in a miscarriage
    of justice (the prejudice component of the test): <i>Joanisse</i>, at p.
    59; <i>R. v. P.(T.)</i> (2002), 59 O.R. (3d) 577 (

      v. G.D.B.</i>, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 520, at paras. 26-29, Major J. of the Supreme
      Court of Canada observed that, in most cases, it is best to begin with
      an inquiry into the prejudice component of an ineffective assistance of
      counsel claim.  If the appellant cannot demonstrate prejudice from the
      alleged ineffective assistance of counsel, it is unnecessary to address
      the competence of counsel at trial.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    standard to be met in relation to the performance component of the test is
    one of reasonableness.  Hindsight has no place in this assessment: see <i>R.
    v. G.D.B.</i>, at para. 27; <i>Joanisse</i>, at p. 61.  The prejudice component
    focuses on the nature and seriousness of counsels errors both from the
    perspective of the reliability of the verdict and the adjudicative fairness
    of the process leading to the verdict: <i>Joanisse</i>, at p. 62.  Prejudice
    can be established if the appellant can show that there is a reasonable probability
    that but for the alleged incompetence, the result of the proceeding would
    have been different.  A reasonable probability in this context is a probability
    that is sufficiently strong to undermine the appellate courts confidence
    in the validity of the verdict: <i>Joanisse</i>, at p.&nbsp;64; <i>R. v.
    Dunbar</i>, 2007 ONCA 840, at para. 23.  As Doherty J.A. indicated in <i>Joanisse</i>,
    at p. 64: A reasonable probability is established when the reviewing court
    is satisfied that because of counsels incompetence, the verdict cannot be
    taken as a reliable assessment of the appellants culpability.</p>

    appellant argues that numerous acts or omissions of his trial counsel were
    incompetent and that these acts or omissions occasioned a miscarriage of
    justice.  In support of this argument, he relies on fresh evidence, the admissibility
    of which is not disputed by the Crown, which includes an affidavit sworn
    by defence counsel at trial (not Mr. Breen), the transcript of the cross-examination
    of defence counsel on his affidavit, an affidavit sworn by the appellant,

    appellant gave two videotaped statements to the police.  The first statement,
    made prior to the appellants arrest, was approximately one and a half hours
    in duration.  The second statement, made at the time of arrest, was approximately
    30 minutes in length.  In his statements, the appellant provided a detailed

    his affidavit filed on the fresh evidence application, defence counsel indicated
    that the Crown disclosure brief was provided to him on June 23, 2004 and
    that he subsequently gave a copy of the brief to the appellant for his review.  The
    brief included a summary of what defence counsel described as the exculpatory
    statement of the appellant and various police officers notes.  No transcription

    counsel reviewed the appellants videotaped statements to the police, as
    well as S.V.s statement to the police and that of the appellants brother,
    within approximately two weeks of his receipt of the Crown disclosure brief.  Although
    he prepared summaries of the statements by S.V. and the appellants brother,
    he did not prepare a summary or transcription of the appellants statements, as
    the statements were exculpatory and both were of considerable length.  Nor
    did he take the steps necessary to obtain a copy of the videotapes or a transcript
    of the appellants
    videotaped statements.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial commenced about 15 months later, on September 26, 2005.  The number
    of meetings held with the appellant by defence counsel to prepare for trial
    is unclear.  However, the following facts are undisputed.  First, the appellant
    was not provided with a copy of his statements to the police prior to trial.  Second,
    defence counsel did not review those statements with the appellant at any
    time.  Third, defence counsel never advised the appellant to review his statements
    to the police.  Fourth, the appellant was never advised by defence counsel
    to refrain from discussing the Crown disclosure brief with his friends  including
    R.D. and K.K.  and to avoid any discussions with his friends regarding the
    events at issue.  Fifth, after July 2004, defence counsel himself failed
    to again review the appellants statements to police before trial.  Sixth,
    prior to trial, defence counsel conceded the voluntariness of the appellants
    statements to the police for the purpose of cross-examination by the Crown.  Seventh,
    at a pre-trial conference held in December 2004, although Crown counsel confirmed
    that the appellants statements would not be tendered as part of the prosecutions
    case, she also indicated that the statements would be used to cross-examine
    the appellant should he elect to testify at trial.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When
    cross-examined on his affidavit, defence counsel said that he was not concerned
    that the appellants statements would form part of the prosecutions case.  Given
    the Crowns comments at the pre-trial conference, this was understandable.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>But
    defence counsel also admitted that he never turned his mind to the potential
    evidentiary use or significance of the appellants statements, or to the
    need to prepare the appellant for cross-examination on them.  He acknowledged
    that he simply did not consider the prospect that the appellant could be
    cross-examined on the statements by the Crown at trial.  As a result, notwithstanding
    Crown counsels clear warning about nine months prior to trial that the appellant
    could be subjected to cross-examination on his statements to the police,
    defence counsel took no steps to prepare the appellant for such cross-examination.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    trial, after the appellants cross-examination was well underway, Crown counsel
    suggested that he review his videotaped statements during a lunch break since
    she intended to question him on parts of his statements.  Defence counsel
    agreed with this suggestion, as [the appellant] hasnt ever seen them.  In
    a later exchange with the trial judge, defence counsel indicated that he
    did not know where Crown counsel was going with her announced intention to
    cross-examine the appellant on his statements, indicating that it had been a
    long time since he [counsel] had reviewed the statements.  In fact, it appears
    that he had not reviewed the statements for approximately 14 months.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant watched his videotaped statements at the courthouse that afternoon
    and the following day during breaks in the trial proceedings.  As his cross-examination
    was then in progress, he did not have the benefit of consultations with his
    counsel while doing so.  Nor did the timing of his review of the statements,
    given the length of the statements, permit thoughtful reflection by the appellant
    on their contents.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    transcript reveals that Crown counsel cross-examined the appellant over two
    days before questioning him on the contents of his statements.  In so doing,
    she elicited testimony from the appellant that contradicted several parts
    of his statements to the police.  In other words, before the appellant was
    cross-examined on his statements and at least in part before he reviewed
    his statements, the foundation was laid by the Crown to argue that the appellants
    trial testimony was inconsistent with his prior statements to the police
    regarding his version of events with S.V.</p>

    counsel cross-examined the appellant for a total of about three days.  About
    77 pages of the transcript are devoted to cross-examination of the appellant
    on his statements to the police.  During this phase of her cross-examination,
    Crown counsel identified approximately 20 examples of inconsistencies and
    contradictions between the appellants trial testimony and his statements
    to the police, many of which concerned critical facts in issue at trial.  These
    included:</p>

    transcript suggests that throughout this lengthy cross-examination, the appellant
    was caught unaware by the contents of his statements to the police on several
    occasions and that he frequently struggled to respond to the questions posed
    by Crown counsel.  More than once, he was compelled to say that he had exaggerated
    or lied in his statements to the police.  He also acknowledged that despite
    numerous earlier opportunities to do so during the course of his interviews
    with the police, it was not until virtually the end of his second statement
    that he alluded to what became one of the central planks of his defence at
    trial, namely, that sexual intercourse with S.V. could not have occurred
    without physical injury to S.V. (scarring, bleeding or ripping) due to the
    alleged size of the appellants penis.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is the evidence of defence counsel on the fresh evidence application that
    until the appellant was confronted at trial with his police statements, defence
    counsel was unaware of any inconsistencies in the appellants description
    of events to the police.  Defence counsel testified that it was only with
    the benefit of hindsight that he appreciated that there was some risk
    for the appellant on cross-examination at trial on his statements to the
    police.  In fact, there were substantial risks.  On any objective reading
    of the transcript, this component of the Crowns cross-examination was nothing
    short of devastating to the appellants credibility.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    conclusion is confirmed by the trial judges reasons.  It is apparent from
    her reasons that the trial judge viewed the appellants credibility as having
    been significantly undermined by his cross-examination on his statements
    to the police.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    we have said, the trial judge rejected the appellants testimony.  She held
    that [t]he main problem with [the appellants] evidence is not that it was
    unsupported but that his testimony was itself flawed.  In support of this
    holding, the trial judge relied on four factors: (i) inconsistencies between
    the appellants examination-in-chief and his cross-examination at trial;
    (ii) inconsistencies between the appellants trial testimony and his statements
    to the police; (iii) what the trial judge viewed as the lack of an air of
    reality in the appellants description of his relationship with S.V.; and
    (iv) the appellants demeanour and attitude towards S.V. while testifying
    at trial.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    respect of the second factor, it was the trial judges view that: (i) the
    appellants evidence at trial was inconsistent with his statements to the
    police about (a) the amount of alcohol that he had consumed and his level
    of intoxication on the night in question; (b) the timing of S.V.s departure
    from his home; and (c) whether the appellant was sexually aroused by S.V.s
    conduct; (ii) the appellant included significant details of S.V.s alleged
    conduct in his trial testimony that he had not mentioned to the police; and
    (iii) in contrast to the appellants claim at trial that the large size of
    his penis presented a physical impediment to the sexual intercourse alleged
    by S.V., this claim and the facts supporting it were never clearly or fully
    disclosed to the police.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus,
    the trial judges reasons reveal that the inconsistencies and contradictions
    between the appellants evidence at trial and his statements to the police
    were integral to her adverse assessment of his credibility.  These inconsistencies
    and contradictions figured prominently in her rejection of the appellants
    testimony.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    least some of those inconsistencies and contradictions were significant.  For
    example, at trial, the appellant testified that although he had been drinking
    on the night in question and had a little bit of a glow, his physiological
    responses were not impaired and he was not inebriated.  Indeed, at least
    initially, he specifically denied that he was drunk.  Later in his testimony,
    he said that he was slightly drunk.  In contrast, he told the police that
    he had
    a lot to drink, that he was inebriated, that he was feeling no pain,
    and that he was drunk.  If the latter description of his condition was accurate,
    it lent credence to the Crowns assertion that the appellant, while in a
    drunken state, had taken advantage of S.V.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Similarly,
    throughout his trial testimony, the appellant was adamant that he was not
    physically attracted to or interested in any way in S.V.  Nor was he sexually
    aroused or even slightly sexually excited by her on the night in question.  Yet,
    when he was cross-examined on his statements to the police, he admitted that
    he had told the police that he was
    getting turned on by S.V. while they were in bed together.  This, too,
    supported the Crowns theory that non-consensual sexual intercourse had taken
    place.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    as we have mentioned, the appellant never clearly told the police that the
    sexual intercourse alleged by S.V. could not have occurred without physical
    injury to her due to the size of his penis.  Yet, at trial, this claim was
    central to the appellants defence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    acknowledge that nothing in the appellants affidavit filed on his fresh
    evidence application specifically outlines what he might have done or said
    differently if he had been fully prepared to give evidence at trial.  However,
    the transcript of his cross-examination at trial reveals a witness who was
    woefully ill-prepared to deal with questioning on his statements to the police.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Preparing
    an accused for cross-examination at trial by having the accused review his
    or her prior statements to the police is not a simple matter of trial tactics.  Rather,
    the valid purpose of such a review is to address the natural phenomenon of
    fading memories.  Trial fairness may be compromised if testifying becomes
    little more than a memory contest.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this case, the appellant provided his statements to the police in April and
    May, 2004, about 16 months prior to the commencement of trial.  Given this
    lengthy interval between the date of the statements and the date of trial,
    there was a clear need for the appellant to refresh his memory regarding
    his statements to the police.  This case turned on credibility.  It was therefore
    vital that the appellant be prepared to face cross-examination on his prior
    statements to the police.  This did not occur.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[35]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    also observe that because defence counsel did not have a transcribed copy
    of the appellants statements in his possession, he was not positioned to
    ensure that the contents of the statements were accurately put to the appellant
    on cross-examination at trial.  In at least one instance, Crown counsel  no
    doubt through inadvertence  arguably misstated the contents of the statements
    by suggesting that the appellant had not provided the police with any details
    of any conversation with S.V. that occurred prior to the oral sex.  In fact,
    the appellant had told the police of some of S.V.s statements while in bed.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[36]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    our opinion, in all these circumstances, defence counsels failure to ensure
    that the appellant was afforded a meaningful opportunity to review his statements
    in preparation for cross-examination materially prejudiced the appellant
    in his defence.  Defence counsels failure to obtain copies of the appellants
    statements to the police for the appellant to review in preparation for giving
    evidence at trial fell below the prevailing standard of competence by counsel
    applicable in a case of this kind.  The following observation by Doherty

    is generally unwise and inappropriate to second-guess trial counsel on decisions
    concerning the evidence to be led at trial in the defence of criminal charges.  In
    the particular circumstances of this case, however, we are satisfied that
    defence counsels ultimate decision to call R.D. and K.K. as witnesses was
    ill-advised and highly prejudicial to the appellants defence.  To illustrate
    the basis for this conclusion, it is necessary to review the background to
    R.D.s and K.K.s evidence in some detail.</p>

    June 22, 2004, the day before his first appearance in court, the appellant
    arranged for a fax to be sent to his counsel enclosing unsigned statements
    from R.D. and K.K.  In his June 2004 statement, R.D. indicated that he spoke
    with the appellant on February 19, 2004, the morning after the visit to Fitzys
    bar, regarding what had transpired between S.V. and the appellant.  R.D.
    said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The next day I spoke to [the appellant], after noting
    her actions toward him that evening, I had asked him if they had had sexual
    intercourse that evening after I had left.  [The appellant] and I are best
    friends and have nothing to hide from each other.  His response to that question
    was a definite no.  He said he had no interest in [S.V.] in any romantic
    or sexual ways.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    her June 2004 statement, K.K. stated:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The next day [the appellant] and I had a conversation
    [on an electronic messaging system], and I asked what happened with them
    that night after we left.  He told me they fooled around and she wanted to
    have sex, but he couldnt because they were both intoxicated and he would
    feel as if he was taking advantage of her because of her drunken state.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Subsequently,
    in August 2004, R.D. and K.K. prepared a joint statement, with the involvement
    of the appellant.  This statement focused on the movements of the appellant
    and his friends, including S.V., on the night of February 18, 2004 prior
    to the attendance at Fitzys bar.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>During
    cross-examination on his affidavit filed on the fresh evidence application,
    defence counsel agreed that if R.D. and K.K. were contemplated as potential
    defence witnesses, it was important that they not be tainted by any discussions
    with the client, the accused.  Nonetheless, he confirmed that he had asked
    the appellant to contact R.D. and K.K. for the purpose of obtaining written
    statements from them of their recollections of the night in question.  He
    said that he made this request to preserve their recollections at a time
    when he understood that the appellant had already spoken to R.D. and K.K.
    about the events at issue.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thereafter,
    as part of his ongoing efforts to persuade the Crown to withdraw the charge
    against the appellant, defence counsel provided the Crown with copies of
    R.D.s and K.K.s unsigned statements.  Their August 2004 joint statement
    was furnished to the Crown at trial.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Two
    matters relating to R.D.s and K.K.s statements and their subsequent evidence
    at trial must be emphasized.  First, their statements contradicted the appellants
    trial testimony in several important respects.  At trial, the appellant maintained
    that he had told R.D. that he had oral sex with S.V.  This disclosure is
    not reflected in R.D.s June 2004 statement.  Similarly, K.K.s June 2004
    statement does not refer to any disclosure by the appellant of sexual activity
    with S.V. apart from some fool[ing] around.  Indeed, fairly read, both
    statements suggest the opposite.  Moreover, K.K.s statement indicates that
    the appellant said that both he and S.V. were intoxicated and that S.V. was
    in a drunken state.  However, at trial, the appellant testified that S.V.
    had not had a lot to drink and that she was very sober.  As we have said,
    he also suggested that he was only slightly drunk and that he was not inebriated.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Defence
    counsel met with R.D. and K.K. on October 6, 2005 when the appellant was
    still under cross-examination.  During this meeting, defence counsel did
    not ask R.D. and K.K. about any discussions with the appellant on the day
    after the attendance at Fitzys bar.  Ultimately, both R.D. and K.K. were
    called as defence witnesses at trial, apparently for the purpose of contradicting
    S.V.s claim that the group, including an individual named John, had attended
    at a Tim Hortons restaurant and a pool hall before arriving at Fitzys bar.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant argues that, given the nature of their anticipated evidence based
    on their statements, the decision to call R.D. and K.K. as defence witnesses
    at trial posed significant risks for his defence.  We agree.  In light of
    the discrepancies between the contents of their statements 
    copies of which had been provided to the Crown  and the appellants testimony,
    it was probable that R.D. and K.K. would be cross-examined on the statements
    made to them by the appellant after the event.  This cross-examination could
    only serve to undermine the appellants credibility and to establish one
    or more prior inconsistent statements by him.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    fact, as might have been anticipated, when R.D. and K.K. did testify at trial,
    they were cross-examined on what the appellant had told them of his activities
    with S.V. during the night of February 18, 2004.  Both witnesses contradicted
    the appellants testimony on this important issue.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    rejecting the appellants evidence, the trial judge placed particular emphasis
    on the inconsistencies between R.D.s testimony and that of the appellant.  She
    stated:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It is quite significant that R.D. testifies that
    he and [the appellant] are close friends and keep nothing from each other.  The
    day after the event, the two discussed S.V.s visit.  R.D. asked [the appellant]
    directly if anything had happened and he was either told nothing happened
    or they may have fooled around a bit.  [The appellant] has testified that
    he performed oral sex on S.V.  I find R.D. did not intend to include oral
    sex in his indication that [the appellant] may have told him they fooled
    around if indeed he told him they did anything at all.  This indicates that
    [the appellant] was not being straight with his good friend.  I can see no
    reason why [the appellant] would not have told R.D. about the oral sex if
    that had occurred as he described.  It appears that [the appellant] was not
    disclosing what had happened when he could and would ordinarily have done
    had there been the oral sex as he described.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>On the contrary, [the appellant] states he told
    R.D.
    nothing happened other than oral sex.  I gave her oral sex and that was
    it.  R. and I are very open.  Were best friends.  I would have told him
    everything.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I find as a fact [the appellant] did not tell R.D.
    he gave S.V. oral sex.  R.D., K.K. and J.B. [the appellants brother] were
    trying so hard to provide evidence supporting [the appel-lants] story, I
    cannot accept that this important detail would have been forgotten or overlooked
    if it occurred.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>As I indicated earlier, innocent misrecollection
    is common but a falsehood [is] always serious in the assessment of credibility.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Nor
    were the discrepancies between K.K.s evidence and that of the appellant
    lost on the trial judge.  The trial judge relied on those aspects of K.K.s
    evidence that contradicted the appellants testimony to support her rejection
    of the appellants evidence.  In her reasons, she observed:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>K.K. also asked [the appellant]the next afternoon
    if anything happened between him and S.V.  He told her they fooled around
    and she wanted to have sex but he couldnt because they were both intoxicated
    he would feel he was taking advantage of her because of her drunken state.  I
    find a statement of this nature was made by [the appellant].  It is telling
    that, in their testimony, K.K. describes S.V. as drunk but [the appellant]
    doesnt.  Further, we know from [the appellants] testimony that there was
    oral sex so his statement to K.K. was a half truth at best.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    rather than contradicting S.V.s description of events leading up to her
    overnight stay at the appellants home, the trial judge viewed R.D.s and
    K.K.s evidence as corroborating key aspects of S.V.s testimony.  In her
    reasons, the trial judge stated:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>R.D.s and K.K.s evidence also had an inadvertent
    effect of supporting the evidence of S.V. on a key assertion of [the appellants]
    defence.  Both confirmed that her initial plan had been to stop by before
    going to snowboard in Collingwood and R.D. states that they went to Fitzys,
    she wound up not going to snowboard and this was not established until she
    was here.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>This is contrary to [the appellants] insistence
    that the overnight visit was planned well in advance and his insinuation
    that it had been S.V.s intention all along to bed [the appellant] during
    reading week when she was broken up with [her boyfriend].  Moreover, this
    inadvertent support reduces the impact of the discrepancy between S.V. and
    [S.V.s boyfriends] evidence.  It can no longer be argued that the visit
    to Collingwood was always a pretext invented by S.V. to hide the truth from
    [her boyfriend] that she was pursuing and bedding [the appellant]. The evidence
    from R.D. and K.K. has confirmed S.V.s contention that leaving to go snowboarding
    was the planned trip that fell through as the events of February 18 played
    out.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[51]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    is a second troubling aspect of the decision to call R.D. and K.K. as witnesses
    at trial notwithstanding the nature of their anticipated evidence.  This
    concerns the circumstances under which their statements were obtained.  Given
    the appellants involvement with R.D. and K.K. in the preparation of their
    statements, Crown counsel argued that their evidence was fabricated and that
    it had been developed through collaboration with the appellant.  On cross-examination
    on his affidavit, defence counsel acknowledged that if the appellants involvement
    in the preparation of R.D.s and K.K.s joint statement became known, There
    was a real downside to it.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge, at least in part, accepted the Crowns argument that R.D.s
    and K.K.s evidence should be discounted on this basis.  She said in her
    reasons: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Much of the evidence of R.D. and K.K. is challenged
    as collusion between them and [the appellant] to show that S.V.s memory
    of the events was faulty and her account false.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Nothing could be more natural than friends discussing
    an evening they were all part of when one of them has been charged with a
    criminal offence for an event arising from it.  In and of itself, the discussion
    does not establish collusion.  However, in each of their testimony R.D. and
    K.K. conceded there were points in their joint statement that they did not
    themselves observe or remember but accept from one anothers memory.  By
    the time the testimony of K.K. was complete, she herself emotionally deflated,
    it was patent that [the appellant] played a major role in the discussion
    that reconstituted the itinerary of the evening such that it was not independent
    support of [the appellants] evidence at all.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Calling
    R.D. and K.K. to testify at trial was clearly fraught with danger for the
    defence.  The potential advantage to the defence of leading evidence through
    R.D. and K.K. that contradicted S.V.s claim of a trip to a Tim Hortons
    restaurant and a pool hall prior to the arrival at Fitzys bar on the night
    of February 18, 2004 pales to insignificance in comparison with the risks
    to the appellants credibility that forseeably would arise on cross-examination
    of R.D. and K.K.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Defence
    counsel admitted as much during cross-examination on his affidavit filed
    on the appellants fresh evidence application when he said, If I had it
    to do all over again, would I have called the two of them?  Probably not,
    given how things unfolded.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>But
    this is not a case where the defence elected to call a witness who, in hindsight,
    simply did not fare well on cross-examination.  That is an everyday occurrence
    in respect of which counsel can neither be faulted nor held responsible.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    is a case where R.D.s and K.K.s anticipated evidence was known in advance
    by both the defence and the Crown.  Based on their June 2004 statements,
    that evidence contradicted the appellants version of events on several disputed
    factual issues.  Moreover, the appellants involvement in the preparation
    of R.D.s and K.K.s statements exposed him to a claim of collusion  a claim
    that eventually, at least implicitly, was accepted by the trial judge.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    conclude that if R.D. and K.K. had not been exposed to cross-examination
    by the Crown, it is highly likely, if not inevitable, that the trial judges
    assessment of the case against the appellant and his credibility would have
    proceeded on a much different basis.  This, too, calls the reliability of
    the verdict into serious question. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    we turn to the matter of S.V.s trial testimony and defence counsels approach
    to her cross-examination.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>S.V.
    gave several statements to the police in which she recounted the details
    of the appellants alleged sexual misconduct.  As well, during her testimony
    at the preliminary inquiry held in this matter, S.V. again outlined the appellants
    alleged assaultive behaviour.  Finally, shortly after the incident in question,
    S.V. disclosed certain aspects of her encounter with the appellant to her
    boyfriend, P.H.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Before
    this court, the appellant argues that defence counsel prejudiced his defence

    on her prior inconsistent statements.  Again, we agree.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    bears repeating that credibility was the central issue in this case.  While
    defence counsel cross-examined S.V. at length, he failed to question her
    on several apparent inconsistencies and contradictions in her evidence, including:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>(i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>S.V.s
    claim at trial that her decision to stay overnight at the appellants home
    was made late in the evening on February 18, 2004, in contrast to her testimony
    at the preliminary inquiry that she brought a bag containing her overnight
    clothes into the appellants home on arrival.  The issue of when S.V. retrieved
    her overnight bag from her car was described as critical by Crown counsel
    in her closing submissions, since the timing of this event could support
    S.V.s claim that she did not decide to stay overnight with the appellant
    until hours after her arrival in Barrie;</p>

    her testimony at the preliminary inquiry that she had done so.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>During
    his cross-examination on his affidavit, when afforded an opportunity to explain
    his failure to cross-examine S.V. on these apparent inconsistencies and contradictions,
    defence counsel merely offered that he did not believe that there were any
    significant inconsistencies in S.V.s accounts of the key events, either
    to the police or at the preliminary inquiry.  In his view, S.V. had been
    consistent throughout regarding her allegation of sexual assault.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is impossible to gauge precisely on appeal the impact that cross-examination
    of S.V. on these issues may have had on the trial judges assessment of her
    credibility.  But the omissions above-described, in combination, suggest
    that less than a reasonably thorough challenge of S.V.s credibility was
    mounted at trial on behalf of the appellant.  Moreover, certain of the identified
    omissions are significant when viewed in the context of the reasons of the
    trial judge in support of her conclusion that S.V.s claim of sexual assault
    had been established beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge devoted almost five pages of her reasons to the assessment of
    S.V.s credibility.  Absent from the list of factors identified by her as
    bearing on S.V.s credibility is mention of any inconsistency between S.V.s
    trial testimony and her account of events to the police, to her boyfriend,
    or at the preliminary inquiry.  In her reasons, the trial judge mentions
    only one alleged prior inconsistent statement by S.V.</p>

    the extent that prior inconsistent statements by S.V. arose on the evidential
    record, they were clearly relevant to the assessment of her credibility.  In
    at least one instance, the inconsistencies were also directly relevant to
    the evaluation of the appellants credibility: P.H.s evidence of the substance
    of S.V.s disclosure to him of sexual activity with the appellant, in contrast
    to S.V.s description of such disclosure, supported the appellants claim
    that only consensual oral sex took place with S.V.</p>

    to alert the trial judge to material issues concerning S.V.s credibility.  S.V.s
    prior inconsistent statements had significant potential for impeachment.  Defence
    counsels failure to exploit this potential prejudiced the appellants defence
    and further undermines this courts confidence in the reliability of the

    defence called evidence from Dr. Joseph A. Zadra, a urologist, who testified
    as to the appellants large penis size and the implausibility of S.V.s version
    of the alleged intercourse.  Dr. Zadra testified that the appellants erect
    penis was more than 8 inches long and 6-1/2 inches in girth.  It was well
    above the 95<span

    average size of a vagina of a young woman who had not yet experienced vaginal
    child birth, according to Dr. Zadra, is 6 inches in depth, maximum.  The
    doctor said that it would be extremely difficult for such a woman to have
    vaginal penetration without artificial lubrication and an extremely gentle
    approach because of tearing and damage to the vagina, especially at the entrance.  Such
    intercourse would be extremely painful.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>S.V.
    had not experienced a vaginal child birth.  She did not complain of pain
    and when she was medically examined a week later there was no evidence of
    tearing or damage to her vagina.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    stating in her reasons that Dr. Zadra gave
    reliable evidence, the trial judge said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Despite Dr. Zadras opinion concerning the difficulty
    of penetration, I do not find that S.V. would necessarily be bleeding and
    scarred.  There is no evidence of S.V.s indiv-idual measurement.  She is
    510 tall and I have no evidence to find that she is average or not.  That
    disproportionate insertion would cause bleeding and scarring in some or even
    most is not determinative of whether it would cause bleeding and scarring
    in S.V.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I am troubled by the lack of report by S.V. of any
    discomfort related to size.  She did report pain due to lack of lubrication
    and friction but that description could be expected for a forced penetration
    by a penis of lesser size.  She did report that she [did not] focus on the
    pain, being preoccupied with the shock at the enormity of the betrayal.  She
    testified she felt nothing as she was thinking about what was happening not
    how it felt, that she felt sick to her stomach.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>S.V. was never asked about penis size although her
    testimony of the event included that when he placed her hand on his penis
    he stated mines still bigger meaning than her wrist and referencing a
    prior occasion when he grabbed her wrist and stated mines bigger which
    in the context she assumed meant his penis.  There is a rule of evidence
    that if there is no cross-examination of a Crown witness on an issue and
    the defence leads evidence to contradict that evidence, the trier of fact
    may take the failure to challenge on a significant matter into account in
    assessing the credibility of the witness and the contrary evidence.  In the
    specifics of this case, since she was not asked, we cannot know if S.V.s
    description of the discomfort she experienced would have focused on this
    aspect.  We know that [the appellant] didnt mention size until he had been
    asked several times about the event and possibly, like him, S.V. did not
    appreciate that size, large or small, had any bearing on the issue of what
    happened.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for the appellant submits that the trial judges reasons exhibit a misapplication
    of the rule in <i>Browne v. Dunn</i> (1893), 6 R. 67 (H.L.).  Arguably, the
    circumstances here do not present the typical <i>Browne v. Dunn</i> situation.  Even
    if it could be said that defence counsel at trial should have put the doctors
    evidence to S.V., the Crown could have done so in her re-examination of S.V.,
    which was not yet completed.  Also, the Crown had received the doctors report
    prior to trial and was not in any way taken by surprise by the evidence.  Before
    the doctor was called to testify, the trial judge received submissions from
    both counsel concerning the anticipated evidence.  It is significant that
    counsel for the Crown did not raise the <i>Browne v. Dunn</i> objection in
    those submissions and waited until final argument to raise the point.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Given
    that the purpose of the rule in <i>Browne v. Dunn</i> is to promote fairness
    in the trial process, we do not discern any unfairness in the leading of
    the expert evidence and the failure to put it squarely to S.V.:  see <i>R.
    v. Verney</i> (1993), 87  C.C.C. (3d) 363 (Ont. C.A.), at p.&nbsp;376 where
    Finlayson J.A. said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><i>Browne v. Dunn</i> is a rule of fairness that
    prevents the ambush of a witness by not giving him an opportunity to state
    his position with respect to later evidence which contradicts him on an essential
    matter.  It is not, however, an absolute rule and counsel must not feel obliged
    to slog through a witnesss evidence-in-chief, putting him on notice of every
    detail that the defence does not accept.  Defence counsel must be free to
    use his own judgment about how to cross-examine a hostile witness.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    there is another matter of concern related to the trial judges treatment
    of the expert evidence.  The trial judge observed that there was a lack of
    evidence concerning the size of S.V.s vagina and the likelihood of bleeding
    and scarring in her case.  As submitted by counsel for the appellant to this
    court:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[T]he relevance of Dr. Zadras evidence did not
    depend upon it affording determinative proof that [S.V.] would suffer bleeding
    and scarring if raped by the appellant.  The evidence was capable of raising
    a reasonable doubt as to [S.V.s] credibility on the issue of consent.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judges reasoning in respect of this evidence suggests that she erred
    in the application of the burden of proof.  Her observation suggested that
    the appellant was obligated to lead evidence concerning bleeding and scarring.  No
    such obligation exists.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    we note that the trial judge said that she was troubled by the lack of report
    by [S.V.] of any discomfort related to size.  Although she reported pain
    due to lack of lubrication and friction, the trial judge said that this
    was consistent with forced penetration by a penis of lesser size.  The
    trial judge did say that a possible explanation was that S.V. said she did
    not focus on the pain as she was shocked by the circumstances of the alleged
    sexual assault.  That said, the trial judge does not appear to have turned
    her mind to the issue whether the lack of report was capable of raising a
    reasonable doubt as to whether intercourse occurred. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Based
    on the above, we would also give effect to this ground of appeal. </p>
  <h2>IV.       DISPOSITION</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    conclude that the ineffective representation of the appellant at trial, together
    with the trial judges flawed treatment of the defence expert evidence, outlined
    above, necessitate a new trial.  In our view, the record establishes a reasonable
    probability that a miscarriage of justice occurred in this case.  Accordingly,
    the appeal is allowed and a new trial is ordered.</p>
