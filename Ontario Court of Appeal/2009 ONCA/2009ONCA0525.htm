  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    main issue to be determined on the arbitration was whether part-time employees
    were entitled, under the terms of the applicable collective agreement, to
    be paid holiday pay for statutory holidays not worked.<a href="#_ftn1"

    Taking into account extrinsic evidence, he resolved the ambiguity in the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Union’s favour.  The
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court disagreed that the agreement was ambiguous and quashed the

  <p class=HeadingNumber><b>BACKGROUND</b></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although
    the grievance giving rise to the arbitration arose under the 2004-2005 collective
    agreement, the arbitrator described the
    “crux of the dispute” as “the proper interpretation of the 2001-2004 collective
    agreement.”  He said that the parties argued the arbitration on “the assumption
    that subsequent contracts mean the same thing as the 2001-2004 agreement.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    as no formal collective agreement was ever signed for the 2001-2004 period,
    the arbitrator determined that a signed July 19, 2001 memorandum of agreement
    (“MOA”) constituted the 2001-2004 Collective Agreement.  The parties do not
    dispute that finding. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    preamble to the MOA stated that “the said Collective Agreement shall include
    the terms of the previous Collective Agreement which expires on August 31,
    2001, provided, however, that the amendments below be incorporated.”  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Appendix
    6 to the MOA, which was the Employer’s last monetary offer of settlement,
    was one of the amendments.  Article 1 of Appendix 6 reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><b>1.         Guaranteed Hours</b></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Both letters of Agreement for guaranteed hours to
    be renewed (estimated cost – 3% of total payroll) and put in Collective Agreement
    and new language for article 19.02 part time to meet new Employment Standards
    Act.     </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Although
    Appendix 6 refers to “both” letters of agreement for guaranteed hours, there
    is some disagreement as to whether there was more than one letter of agreement
    that referred to guaranteed hours.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a>  However, it is common ground that Article 1 refers,
    at least, to a letter of agreement dated November 28, 1997 relating to the
    1997-1999 and 1999-2001 collective agreements.  It states in part: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Union and Management agree to the following guaranteed hours in exchange
    for the stat qualified Article 19:02 for part-time employees only.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Article
    19:02 of the 1997-1999 and 1999-2001 collective agreements was entitled “Pay
    for Regularly Scheduled Work on a Paid Holiday”.  Article 19:02(a) stated
    that “[a] part-time employee who is scheduled to work on” one of the listed
    statutory holidays “[s]hall be paid at the rate of time and one-half (1½)
    times regular rate for each hour worked on the above holiday.”  Article 19:02(b)
    provided that “[a] part-time employee who does not work on a paid holiday
    named in 19:02(a) and who does not qualify for the holiday pay as set out
    in 19:02(a) shall not be entitled to a holiday pay.”  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    arbitrator determined that Appendix 6 to the MOA was ambiguous.  Relying
    on evidence extrinsic to the wording of the MOA to resolve the ambiguity,
    the arbitrator concluded that the employees were entitled to the holiday
    pay for statutory holidays.  </p>

    agree with the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court that the arbitrator’s decision interpreting the collective
    agreement is to be reviewed on a standard of reasonableness. The proper approach
    to the reasonableness standard of review is as set out in <i><span style='line-height:200%;'>Dunsmuir
    v.
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">

  <p class=HeadingNumber style='line-height:
normal;'><span>               </span>Tribunals have a margin of appreciation
    within the range of acceptable and rational solutions.  A court conducting
    a review for reasonableness <span style='color:black;'>inquires into the
    qualities that make a decision reasonable, referring both to the process
    of articulating the reasons and to outcomes. In judicial review, reasonableness
    is concerned mostly with the existence of justification, transparency and
    intelligibility within the decision-making process. But it is also concerned
    with whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes
    which are defensible in respect of the facts and law.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    reject the Employer’s submission that the effect of the arbitrator’s decision
    was to amend the collective agreement and that, as such, the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court was entitled to review it on a standard of correctness.  The
    case was argued before the arbitrator and the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court as one relating to the ambiguity in Appendix 6 of the MOA.  In
    our view, the issue here is properly characterized as one of ambiguity.  The
    arbitrator’s decision resolved the ambiguity and the decision did not purport
    to, or in effect, amend the collective agreement.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    reaching the decision that Appendix 6 was ambiguous, the arbitrator said
    the following:  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The union contends this paragraph indicates employees
    were to be paid for statutory holidays.  According to this line of argument,
    this provision indicates the employer was agreeing to bear a cost of 3%,
    and [the employer’s human resources representative at the time] had stated
    this was the cost of providing holiday pay.  The employer notes the MOA continued
    the terms of the previous agreement except where the parties agreed to amend
    it.  The employer also notes the reference to 3% appears in the middle of
    the language dealing with guaranteed hours, rather than in the subsequent
    wording about holidays.  (No evidence was led as to the actual cost, if any,
    of guaranteed hours, but the employer does concede 3% is the approximate
    cost of eight statutory holidays.)  The employer also notes that the MOA
    called for the renewal of the letter of understanding about guaranteed hours
    and the letter being renewed, as set out in the previous agreement, says
    the guarantee was given “in exchange” for statutory holiday pay.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>There is some force to the argument made by each
    party about the meaning of the MOA.  In my view, the wording of this document
    does not clearly indicate whether employees are entitled to statutory holiday
    pay in addition to the payment in lieu of benefits.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    our view, these paragraphs reflect the arbitrator’s reasoning process leading
    to the conclusion that the language of Appendix 6 is ambiguous.  His reasons
    meet the transparency and intelligibility requirements set out in <i>Dunsmuir. </i>Moreover,
    his conclusion that the agreement is ambiguous is within the range of “possible,
    acceptable outcomes, which are defensible in respect of the facts and law” for
    several reasons.  However, before explaining our reasons for saying the arbitrator’s
    conclusion was within the range of possible acceptable outcomes, we note
    that the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court relied on a number of inaccurate facts in reaching the contrary
    conclusion.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    example, the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court indicated that the MOA
    “clearly stated an intention to incorporate <u>all</u> the terms of previous
    collective agreement<b><i><u>s</u></i></b>”, whereas the actual wording referred
    only to the singular
    “previous Collective Agreement which expires on August 31, 2001” (underlining
    in original; emphasis added in bold/italics/underlining).  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    addition, the Divisional Court stated that the “letters of agreement regarding
    guaranteed hours in the prior collective agreement clearly and explicitly
    indicated that holiday pay was to be <u>included in the 14% in lieu of benefits
    payment</u>” (emphasis in original).  In fact, the letter of agreement regarding
    guaranteed hours in the prior collective agreement did not refer to the 14%
    in lieu of benefits payment.  Rather, as set out above, it provided that
    the employees would forego holiday pay for statutory holidays in exchange
    for guaranteed hours.  As noted in footnote 2, there had been a 1992 letter
    of agreement containing the terms referred to by the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court.  However, that letter had expired in 1997 and did not form
    part of the agreement between the parties that immediately preceded the MOA. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Returning
    to an analysis of the arbitrator’s reasons, there are several reasons for
    finding that his conclusion that the collective agreement was ambiguous was
    reasonable. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    the language of Appendix 6 is internally inconsistent.  There are at least
    two reasonable interpretations of Appendix 6. On one reading, urged by the
    Employer, Appendix 6 has the effect of disentitling employees to holiday
    pay for statutory holidays.  The other interpretation, urged by the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Union, entitles the employees to holiday pay for statutory holidays.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    difficulty in interpretation arises from the inconsistency in Appendix 6
    between its reference to the letters of agreement and its reference to new
    language for Article 19:02 to meet the new <i>Employment Standards Act</i>.  The
    1997 letter of agreement provides that part-time employees are not entitled
    to holiday pay for statutory holidays.  On the other hand, the inclusion
    of language in Article 19:02 to meet the <i>Employment Standards Act, 2000</i>,
    S.O. 2000, c. 41 would entitle employees to pay for statutory holidays.  To
    add to the difficulty, there is reference to 3% of total payroll, wording
    that the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court did not address.  The purpose of this reference is not clear,
    particularly in light of the inconsistency referred to above and the location
    of the reference in the paragraph.  </p>

    we are of the view that it was open to the arbitrator in concluding that
    the language was ambiguous to consider the evidence that the reference to
    3% in Appendix 6 was to the Employer’s cost of providing holiday pay for
    statutory holidays to part-time employees.  The respondent does not dispute
    that it is open to an arbitrator considering a submission that a provision
    in a collective agreement is ambiguous to have regard to extrinsic evidence
    in determining the issue of ambiguity.  See <i><span style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>Noranda

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Having
    determined that Appendix 6 was ambiguous, it was also open to the arbitrator
    to have regard to extrinsic evidence to assist in clarifying the ambiguity.  After
    executing the MOA, a “blue book”, entitled “Collective Agreement”
    between the parties “September 1, 2001 – August 31, 2004”, purporting to
    set out the terms of the collective agreement, was prepared and distributed.  The
    blue book was not signed by the parties and it was for that reason that the
    arbitrator found that the MOA constituted the collective agreement.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>That
    said, in trying to resolve the ambiguity in Appendix 6, the arbitrator had
    regard to two provisions in the blue book.  First, he noted that Article
    17:01, which dealt with guaranteed hours, did not include the phrase “in
    exchange” for statutory holidays that had been included in the 1997 letter
    of agreement.  Further, the arbitrator noted that Article 19:02 in the blue
    book created an entitlement to holiday pay for statutory holidays regardless
    of whether the employee works on the statutory holiday.  The arbitrator concluded
    that the inclusion of these provisions in the blue book favoured the interpretation
    of the MOA urged by the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Union.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    addition, immediately after the MOA came into effect, the Employer began
    paying part-time employees for statutory holidays not worked, which was consistent
    with Article 19:02 of the blue book. Moreover, the Employer continued these
    payments without objecting for over three years.  The Employer’s practice
    supports the

    Union’s interpretation of Appendix 6.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    February 2005, during negotiations for the next collective agreement, the
    Employer’s manager of human resources, who had not been involved in the MOA
    negotiations, took the position with the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    Union that part-time employees were not entitled to holiday pay for statutory
    holidays under the MOA.  However, the Employer called no evidence to support
    this position or explain why payments had been made for the previous three
    years.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    arbitrator had regard to both the above provisions in the blue book and the
    Employer’s practice of paying holiday pay for statutory holidays.  The arbitrator
    concluded that, taken as a whole, these facts strongly suggest that the Employer
    understood that the MOA constituted an entitlement to holiday pay for statutory
    holidays.  He also noted the absence of evidence suggesting that the Employer’s
    representatives involved in the negotiation and execution of the MOA understood
    it to mean something different or that someone mistakenly had authorized
    the payments made.  He concluded that, taken as a whole, the evidence of
    past practice resolved the ambiguity in the Union’s favour.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent argues that the arbitrator erred in considering the evidence referred
    to above in resolving the ambiguity because that evidence failed to meet
    the test set out in <i><span style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>John

    do not accept this argument.  Even assuming that the <i>Bertram</i> test
    applies to the circumstances of this case, in our view, it is implicit in
    the arbitrator’s reasoning that he had regard to the appropriate factors.  In
    any event, we are satisfied that the evidence he relied upon could reasonably
    come within the factors suggested in that case.  </p>

    employees were to be paid for statutory holidays they did not work.  As a
    result, throughout these reasons, when we refer to employees and to holiday
    or statutory pay, the references are to part-time employees being paid for
    statutory holidays not worked.  </p>

    suspended part-time employees’ right to holiday pay for statutory holidays
    for a period of time during which it would be “deemed to be included in 14%
    in lieu of benefits”.  That letter of agreement expired in 1997. It did not
    make reference to guaranteed hours.</p>
