  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    individual defendants John Falcioni and John Perdue move for an order striking
    the notice of cross-appeal delivered by the respondents.  The moving parties
    state that they delivered no notice of appeal and that they were not brought
    into nor named a party to any other appeal brought by any other party.  They
    submit that the notice of cross-appeal is a fresh appeal which was required
    to be commenced by delivery of a notice of appeal rather than a notice of
    cross-appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondents further submit that as the judgment of the trial court is dated
    January 23, 2009, the Rules require that any notice of appeal be delivered
    within 30 days of the date of judgment.  The notice of cross-appeal was delivered
    March 5.  If the moving parties are correct and a notice of appeal is required,
    rather than a notice of cross-appeal, the respondents are out of time and
    the appeal (now named a cross-appeal) should be struck.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    action which gives rise to the issue raised was a complex one and was tried
    before Newbould J. over 18 days.  His reasons for judgment were delivered
    January 23, 2009. The trial judge succinctly summarized the issues in the
    first three paragraphs of his reasons.  I can do no better than to repeat
    them:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[1]       This action arises from a number of contracts
    made by Ontario Realty Corporation (ORC) with corporations related to the
    defendant Frank Angelo Gabriele (Gabriele).  One of the contracts involved
    an environmental clean up of a site.  Six of the contracts involved sales
    by ORC to a Gabriele related corporation.  The plaintiffs sue in fraud, conspiracy
    and unjust enrichment. The claims relate to alleged manipulation of bids
    for the purchase of the properties and the obtaining of unlawful price reductions
    for those properties.  It is alleged that with respect to the environmental
    clean-up transaction, these were manipulated bids and the work contracted
    for was not done but billed and paid for by ORC.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[2]       The statement of claim is lengthy, some
    500 pages, and has been amended a number of times.  There were many other
    transactions that were initially impugned but they have not been pursued.  A
    number of individuals were sued, some of whom remain defendants and others
    who do not.  Included in the personal defendants against whom claims are
    made are three former employees of ORC, Vincent Catalfo, John Perdue and
    John Falcioni. The other remaining personal defendants are business partners
    of Gabriele or persons involved with related corporations.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[3]       One of the sale transactions in issue
    involved a property in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Aurora.  The transaction did not close.  The purchaser, P. Gabriele &amp; Sons
    Limited (Gabriele Ltd.), has counterclaimed for damages for an alleged breach
    by ORC of the agreement of purchase and sale resulting from its failure to
    close the transaction.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants Frank Angelo Gabriele, Rosebury Holdings Inc., Michael Zentil
    and Mauro Tonietto appeal from the judgment of the trial court and in their
    notice of appeal ask:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>that the judgment be set aside FOR THE MOST PART
    and that judgment be granted in favour of the Appellants</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Their
    notice of appeal was delivered February 19, 2009, well with the 30 day time
    limit for the filing of an appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    notice of cross-appeal was  delivered by the respondents March 5, 2009 and
    asks that the judgment be varied as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Judgment
    for damages in the amount $300,000 together with interest and costs be granted
    against the defendant, John Falcioni (Falcioni) in respect of the transaction
    known as Brittania/Tourkin;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Judgment
    for damages in the amount of $291,861.20 together with interest and costs
    be granted against the defendant, John Perdue (Perdue) in respect of the
    transaction known as Bowmanville; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Judgment
    for damages in the amount of $216,500 together with interest and costs be
    granted against the defendant, John Perdue in respect of the transaction
    known as Bowmanville;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No
    relief is claimed in relation to any of the appellants named in the notice
    of appeal delivered February 19, 2009.  In these circumstances, where the
    cross-appeal is irrelevant to and does not involve the parties bringing the
    appeal, the moving parties submit, that the respondents ought to have delivered
    a notice of appeal rather than a notice of cross-appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Cross-appeals
    are governed by rule 61.07 and it provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>CROSS APPEALS</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>61.07 (1)        A respondent who,</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a)       seeks to set aside or vary the order
    appealed from; or</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(b)       will seek, if the appeal is allowed
    in whole or in part, other relief or a different disposition than the order
    appealed from,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>shall within 15 days after service of the notice
    of appeal serve a notice of cross-appeal (Form 61E) on all parties whose
    interests may be affected by the cross-appeal and on any person entitled
    by statute to be heard on the appeal, stating the relief sought and the grounds
    of the cross-appeal.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(l.l)      A respondent may, subject to subrule
    (1.2) serve a notice of cross-appeal without obtaining leave to appeal for
    the cross-appeal if,</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a)       there is an appeal as of right; or</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(b)       leave to appeal has been granted.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1.2)    The respondent shall obtain leave to appeal
    in the manner provided by subrule 61.03(8) or 61.03(18), as the case may
    be, if the cross-appeal is taken under,</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a)       clause 133(b) of the <i>Courts of
      Justice Act</i>; or</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(b)       another statute that requires leave
    for an appeal.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2)       The notice of cross-appeal, with proof
    of service, shall be filed in the office of the Registrar within ten days
    after service.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3)       Where a respondent has not delivered
    a notice of cross-appeal, no cross appeal may be heard except with leave
    of the court hearing the appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view a plain reading of the rule suggests that the respondents are within
    their right and entitled to deliver a notice of cross-appeal.  There is nothing
    in the rule that requires that the subject of the cross-appeal must relate
    to the appeal. Nor is there any requirement that the only responding parties
    to the cross-appeal must be the appellants.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    language of rule is broad. The respondents to the appeal are Ontario Realty
    Corporation and Her Majesty the Queen in right of the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    Province of
    <st1:PlaceName
 w:st="on">
    Ontario as represented by the Attorney General. They are the responding parties
    to the notice of appeal delivered February 19, 2009 and they seek to vary
    the judgment appealed from and thus are within rule 61.07(1)(a).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    not directly dispositive of the precise point raised on this motion, in my
    view the decision of this court in <i>Sigesmond v. Royal College of Dental
    Surgeons of Ontario</i>, (2006) O.J. No. 3334 is powerfully persuasive.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    issue is <i>Sigesmond </i>arose in the circumstances of an appeal from an
    order of the
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court in a professional misconduct case. Dr. Sigesmond had been
    charged with seven counts of professional misconduct by the College.  The
    Discipline Committee found him guilty on all counts.  The doctor’s appeal
    to the
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court was allowed in respect of four of the counts but was dismissed
    in relation to the other three counts. The College was granted leave to appeal
    the order of the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court by this court February 13, 2006 and served Dr. Sigesmond
    with notice of appeal February 15, 2006.  On March 2, 2006 Dr. Sigesmond
    served the College with a notice of cross-appeal. The College, by way of
    appeal, sought to restore the Discipline Committee’s conviction of Dr. Sigesmond
    on all counts of professional misconduct while Dr. Sigesmond sought to set
    aside the conviction on all counts. The College moved for an order to quash
    Dr. Sigesmond’s cross-appeal on the basis that Dr. Sigesmond required leave
    to appeal.  This court concluded that Dr. Sigesmond did not require leave
    to cross-appeal and dismissed the motion to quash.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    basis for the College’s motion was its position that Dr. Sigesmond required
    leave to appeal because the issues he raised in his notice of cross-appeal
    were not the same as those the College raised in its appeal.  The College’s
    submission was that Dr. Sigesmond had to obtain leave to appeal because he
    alleged different errors by the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court in respect to issues other than those raised by the College
    in its notice of appeal.  The argument, if not identical, is very similar
    to the position taken by the moving appellants in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    reasons of Borins J.A. writing for this court are most helpful.  At paragraph
    10:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>10.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Doctrinally,
    an appeal is taken from the order or judgment of the court.  In some proceedings,
    the court’s order may resolve more than one issue, as in this appeal.  Sometimes,
    and this appeal is a prime example, success in the court below is divided.  As
    a result of Dr. Sigesmond’s appeal to the
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court, some of his convictions were set aside, while others were
    sustained.  The College was first off the starting line and obtained leave
    to appeal to restore the findings of guilt against Dr. Sigesmond that were
    set aside.  However, the opposite could have taken place, and Dr. Sigesmond
    could have been the first party to obtain leave to appeal.  Thus, had the
    circumstances been the reverse, there is no doubt that the Collge would have
    wanted to proceed with its appeal, but in these circumstances, by cross-appeal.  In
    my view, it would undoubtedly have done so in reliance on rule 67.07(1.1)(b).  It
    would not have sought leave to appeal.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>11.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Obviously,
    there can be a cross-appeal only if there is an appeal.  Although each party
    could commence a separate appeal in such circumstances, the provisions of
    Rule 61 enable the parties to avoid separate proceedings by permitting the
    respondent to commence a cross-appeal. This is a mechanism directed to the
    simplification of proceedings, avoidance of multiple proceedings, judicial
    economy and the reduction of litigation expenses for the parties.  As such,
    a cross-appeal is similar to a counterclaim and a third party claim.  In
    most cases, a party may appeal as of right.  In other cases, such as this
    appeal, the intended appellant must obtain leave to appeal. Provided that
    there is an appeal as of right or leave to appeal has been granted, rule
    61.07(1.1) permits a respondent to serve a notice of cross-appeal.  The only
    exceptions are found in rule 61.07(1.2) which requires the respondent to
    obtain leave to cross-appeal if the cross-appeal is in respect of costs,
    or leave to appeal is required by a statute other than the CJA.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>12.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    summary, rule 61.07(1.1)(b) expressly states that leave to appeal is not
    required to serve a notice of cross-appeal if leave to appeal has been granted.
    In this case, the respondent was granted leave to appeal.  Nowhere in Rule
    61.67 does it state, as the College contends, that a respondent is required
    to obtain leave to appeal if the cross-appeal relates to a different issue
    or a different part of the order or which leave to appeal has been granted.  Logically,
    almost invariably a cross-appeal will be based on a different error in the
    court below than that on which the appeal is based. Moreover taken to its
    logical conclusion, if the College is correct, there could now be a cross-appeal,
    with or without leave, on any issue different from the issue raised by the
    appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view the comments of Borins J.A. are equally applicable to the issue raised
    on this motion.  A notice of cross-appeal will be appropriate where the issues
    raised on the cross-appeal are different from those raised on the appeal
    and where the parties to the cross-appeal may be different from the appellants.  In
    my view, it is merely a logical extension that where different issues are
    raised on the cross-appeal so too may the parties to that cross-appeal be
    different and particularly so in a case involving multiple parties.</p>
