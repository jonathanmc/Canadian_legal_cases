  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants, Steven Lindsay and Raymond Bonner, appeal their convictions for
    extortion and extortion for the benefit of, or at the direction of, or in
    association with, a criminal organization, namely, the Hells Angels.  The
    main focus of the appeals is a constitutional challenge to ss. 467.1 and
    467.12 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>, which provide:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>467.1(1) The following definitions apply in this
    Act.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>“criminal organization” means a group, however
    organized, that</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a)       is composed of three or more persons
    in or outside
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    ; and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b)       has as one of its main purposes or main
    activities <i>the facilitation</i> or commission of one or more serious offences
    that, if committed, would likely result in the direct or indirect receipt
    of a material benefit, including a financial benefit, by the group or by
    any of the persons who constitute the group.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:
center;'>. . .</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            467.12(1) Every person who commits
    an indictable offence under this or any other Act of Parliament for the benefit
    of, or at the direction of, or <i>in association with</i>, a criminal organization
    is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term
    not exceeding fourteen years.   [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants contend that these provisions, and in particular the words “the
    facilitation” in s. 467.1 and “in association with”
    in s. 467.12, violate s. 7 of the <i>Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i> because
    they are both vague and overbroad.</p>

    Barrie home of M.M., a dealer in black market satellite television equipment,
    and demanded that he pay them $75,000 to cover an alleged debt arising from
    an earlier sale.  The appellants threatened M.M. with bodily harm.  Both
    men were wearing jackets bearing the Hells Angels logo, though M.M. only
    realized this when they turned their backs and walked away from his house.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>M.M.
    reported the encounter to police.  At their direction, M.M. arranged through
    an intermediary to meet Lindsay at a local restaurant on January 31, 2002.  He
    agreed to wear a body pack to record the encounter.  Bonner came to the restaurant
    with Lindsay, but waited in the truck while Lindsay went inside.  Lindsay
    wore boots with the words “Hells Angels North Toronto” and the death head
    logo, a belt bearing the words “Hells Angels”
    embroidered on it and a death head on its buckle, a t-shirt bearing the death
    head logo and the words “Hells Angels Singen”, and a necklace with a pendant
    of the Hells Angels death head logo.  Bonner wore a jacket bearing the Hells

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is no doubt that the principles of fundamental justice enshrined in s. 7
    of the <i>Charter</i> protect against both vague and overbroad laws.  The
    concepts of vagueness and overbreadth were well-described by Cory J. in <i>R.
    v. Heywood </i>(1994), 94 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (S.C.C.) at p. 516:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Overbreadth and vagueness are different concepts,
    but are sometimes related in particular cases….[T]he meaning of a law may
    be unambiguous and thus the law will not be vague; however, it may still
    be overly broad.  Where a law is vague, it may also be overly broad, to the
    extent that the ambit of its application is difficult to define.  Overbreadth
    and vagueness are related in that both are the result of a lack of sufficient
    precision by a legislature in the means used to accomplish an objective.  In
    the case of vagueness, the means are not clearly defined.  In the case of
    overbreadth the means are too sweeping in relation to the objective.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is also no doubt that s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i> and the protection embedded
    in it against vague and overbroad laws, are engaged in this appeal.  That
    is because a conviction under s. 467.12 of the <i>Code</i> can result in
    imprisonment, as it did in this case.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants contend that ss. 467.1 and 467.12 are both vague and overbroad.  They
    single out “the facilitation” in s. 467.1 and “in association with” in s.
    467.12 as phrases that trigger vagueness and overbreadth concerns.  They
    submit that the effect of these words is that s. 467.12 of the <i>Code</i> creates “a
    fundamentally standardless offence.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    several reasons, I do not accept this submission.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    it is important not to exaggerate the role of the vagueness and overbreadth
    principles in Canadian constitutional jurisprudence.  They exist, they are
    regularly invoked by litigants unhappy with certain laws, but the reality
    is that they are rarely applied by the courts to invalidate federal or provincial
    laws.  The reason for this is the careful and narrow way these principles
    have been defined in the case law.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    overbreadth exists only if the adverse effect of legislation on individuals
    subject to it is grossly disproportionate to the state interest the legislation
    seeks to protect or achieve: see <i>R. v. Malmo-Levine </i>(2003), 179 C.C.C.
    (3d) 417 (S.C.C.) at para. 143.  This test, as Sharpe J.A. noted recently, “clearly
    incorporates a substantial measure of deference to the legislature’s assessment
    of the risk to public safety and the need for the impugned law”: <i>Cochrane
    v.
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario</i> (2008), 92 O.R. (3d) 321 (
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) at para. 31.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly,
    a law should be declared impermissibly vague only if it does not provide
    a “basis for legal debate and coherent judicial interpretation.…[i]f judicial
    interpretation is possible, then an impugned law is not vague”: <i>R. v.
    Canadian Pacific Ltd.</i> (1995), 99 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (S.C.C.) at para. 79.  It
    follows that there is “a relatively high threshold” for potential application
    of the vagueness principle to an impugned law: <i>Winko v.
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    British Columbia (Forensic Psychiatric Institute)</i> (1999), 135 C.C.C.
    (3d) 129 (S.C.C.) at para. 68.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the word “facilitation” and the phrase “in association with” are common and
    well-understood, both in ordinary parlance and in a legal context.  This
    was a central point in the trial judge’s ruling on the constitutional issue.  She
    wrote at paras. 58 and 59:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The word “facilitate” also has a clear meaning.  It
    is defined in <i>The Concise</i> <i>Oxford Dictionary</i> (10th<sup> </sup>ed.)
    to mean, “make easy or easier”.  <i>Black’s Law Dictionary</i> (7th ed.)
    indicates that the word
    “facilitation” has a recognized meaning in the context of criminal law, as
    follows: “The act or an instance of aiding or helping; esp., in criminal
    law, the act of making it easier for another person to commit a crime”;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>. . .</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The phrase “in association with” is not impermissibly
    vague.  The phrase is intended to apply to those persons who commit criminal
    offences in linkage with a criminal organization, even though they are not
    formal members of the group.  The <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i> (10th
    ed.) defines the phrase “associate oneself with” to mean, “allow oneself
    to be connected with or seen to be supportive of”.  The phrase “in association
    with” requires that the accused commit a criminal offence in connection with
    the criminal organization.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>I agree with this reasoning.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    this point, I also highlight the similar reasoning, with which I also agree,
    of Ewaschuk J. in another case involving a constitutional challenge to ss.
    467.1 and 467.13 of the <i>Code</i>, <i>R. v. Ward et al</i>, [2008] C.L.B.
    15134 (Ont. S.C.J.) at paras. 6 and 7:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>As for the word “facilitation”, I am satisfied
    that it does not give rise to a “standardless sweep.”  Instead, it is a common
    English word which means to aid someone, to make a matter easier for someone
    to do.  In this sense, it constitutes an intelligible standard and is not
    disproportionate to its legitimate legislative purpose.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>As for the expression “in association with”, I
    am satisfied that it means that the offence instructed must be done in connection
    with the criminal organization and not for the instructor’s personal benefit
    alone unrelated to that of a criminal organization.  I find that the expression “in
    association with” is a limiting expression and constitutes an intelligible
    standard which is not disproportionate to its legitimate legislative purpose. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    there are a variety of sections of the <i>Criminal Code</i> in which the
    concept of
    “facilitation” and the phrase “in association with” are utilized. See, for
    example: ss. 83.03, 83.04(a), 83.18(2), 83.19, 83.2, 83.21, and 83.23 (terrorism
    offences); 186(1.1) and 186.1 (wiretap authorizations); 230(a) and 231(6.1)
    (murder); 244(2)(a) (discharging a firearm); and 718.2(a)(iv) (sentencing).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    might be contended that this is a bootstrap point, that there is no link
    between the number of times a word is employed in a law and whether the word
    is vague or overbroad.  I do not agree.  In my view, the resort by Parliament
    to the words “facilitation” and “facilitating” and the phrase “in association
    with” in diverse sections of the <i>Criminal Code</i> underlines the second
    point above in my analysis, namely, that the words at issue in these appeals
    truly are common and well-understood.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth,
    the constitutionality of ss. 467.1, 467.12 and 467.13 has been considered
    by several courts across the country, including the British Columbia Court
    of Appeal.  In these cases, the courts have held that these provisions are
    not vague or overbroad: see <i>R. v. Terezakis</i> (2007), 223 C.C.C. (3d)
    344 (B.C.C.A.), leave to appeal refused, [2007] S.C.C.A. No. 487; <i>R. v.
    Ward</i>, supra; <i>R. v. Smith</i> <span class=canliicitation><span style='color:black'>(2006),
    280 Sask. R. 128</span></span><span style='color:black'> </span>(Q.B.); and <i>R.
    v. Joseph </i>500-01-004704-059 (
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Que.
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    S.C.) December 18, 2006,
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Montreal.  Moreover, the predecessor of s. 467.1, which also employed the
    phrase “in association with”, survived many constitutional challenges on
    vagueness and overbreadth grounds, including one in the Quebec Court of Appeal:
    see <i>R. v. Couture</i>, [2007] J.Q. No. 13091 (C.A.), leave to appeal refused,
    [2008] S.C.C.A. No. 58.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    review of the reasoning in these cases leads to an obvious point: it is not
    surprising that the Supreme Court of Canada has twice refused leave to appeal
    to enable it to consider constitutional challenges to s. 467.1 and related
    subsections of the <i>Criminal Code</i> (both the current version and its
    predecessor); there is simply no serious vagueness or overbreadth issue with
    respect to these provisions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fifth,
    I do not accept that the use of the word
    “facilitation” and the phrase “in association with” in ss. 467.1 and 467.12
    will inevitably mean that the innocent actions of some persons may be swept
    into the net of criminal charges.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the trial judge responded to this submission in an appropriate fashion,
    at para. 59:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Whether the particular connection is sufficient
    to satisfy the “in association with” requirement will be for a court to determine,
    based on the facts of the case.  It is not necessary for the legislation
    to set precise parameters on the relationship between the accused and the
    criminal organization.  There is a risk zone for criminal sanction delineated.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Precisely
    the same point was made by McLachlin J. in <i>Winko, supra</i>, at para.
    68:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Laws must of necessity cover a variety of situations.  Given
    the infinite variability of conduct, it is impossible to draft laws that
    precisely foresee each case that might arise.  It is the task of judges,
    aided by precedent and considerations like the text and purpose of a statute,
    to interpret laws of general application and decide whether they apply to
    the facts before the court in a particular case.  This process is not in
    breach of the principles of fundamental justice; rather, it is in the best
    tradition of our system of justice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Indeed,
    the process described by the trial judge and by McLachlin J. has already
    been employed by Canadian courts with respect to the interpretation of s.
    467.12 of the <i>Code</i>.  For example, the trial judge interpreted s. 467.12
    as a specific intent offence, stating at para. 64:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]here is an implicit requirement that the accused
    committed the predicate offence with the intent to do so for the benefit
    of, at the direction of, or in association with a group he/she knew had the
    composition of a criminal organization….</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>Similarly, in <i>Terezakis</i>, <i>supra</i>, Chaisson
    J.A. interpreted s. 467.12 as having a knowledge component, stating at para.
    60:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[I]n a prosecution for an offence under ss. 467.11,
    467.12 or 467.13, the Crown would be obliged to establish that the accused
    had knowledge of the criminal main purpose or activity of the group.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>In my view, interpretations like these assist in creating
    a clear intelligible standard for citizens and law enforcement personnel.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, I conclude that ss. 467.1 and 467.12 of the <i>Criminal Code</i> are
    not impermissibly vague and overbroad.  Accordingly, they do not infringe
    s. 7 of the <i>Charter.</i></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>(2) <u>The application of s. 467.12 of the <i>Code</i></u><i></i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants contend that there were fundamental flaws in the trial judge’s
    reasoning leading to her conclusion that they committed the offence of extortion “in
    association with” the Hells Angels.  They also submit that her verdict on
    these charges was unreasonable.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    core of the trial judge’s reasons on this issue is contained in paras. 1084-1089
    of the trial judgment:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-size:7.0pt;'> </span>I am unable
    to agree with the defence submission that to be convicted on the evidence
    in this case, the accused must have done something “active” to associate
    themselves with the organization, beyond wearing its symbols, or that the
    fact that Mr. M. did not see the HAMC emblem until Mr. Lindsay and Mr. Bonner
    turned around indicates that they did not intend to invoke the organization’s
    symbols.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The “in association with” element is established
    by the evidence of the manner in which Mr. Lindsay and Mr. Bonner chose to
    portray themselves to Mr. M.&nbsp; I have found that on January 23, 2002,
    both Mr. Lindsay and Mr. Bonner went to Mr. M.’s house wearing jackets bearing
    the primary symbols of the HAMC, the name
    “Hells Angels” and the death head logo.&nbsp; In so doing, they presented
    themselves not as individuals, but as members of a group with a reputation
    for violence and intimidation.&nbsp; Only full members of the organization
    could wear its symbols.&nbsp; It is a reasonable inference and one that I
    draw, that Mr. Lindsay and Mr. Bonner were each well aware of the implications
    of their choice of attire. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>On January 31, 2002, for their meeting in a public
    place, Mr. Lindsay chose to wear less overt garb, but nonetheless he was
    attired in paraphernalia displaying his connection to the HAMC.&nbsp; This
    included boots with the words “Hells Angels North Toronto” and the death
    head logo on the foot.&nbsp; Mr. Bonner waited outside in a vehicle, wearing
    the same jacket as on January 23.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Mr. Lindsay told Mr. M. on January 31 that if he
    did not receive a sufficient amount of money each month, he would send “people” to
    Mr. M.’s house, and that the money sought was his and five other “guys” who
    were “the same kind of mother fuck as I am”.&nbsp; It is a reasonable inference
    and one that I draw, that Mr. Lindsay intended to communicate that he would
    send other members of the Hells Angels to Mr. M.’s home.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Both Mr. Lindsay and Mr. Bonner were full members
    of the HAMC at the time.&nbsp; Mr. Lindsay was a particularly committed member,
    who kept various chapter cards in his possession, used his chapter’s clubhouse
    as his address on his driver’s licence, travelled to other HAMC venues and
    spent time with other members, and wore front rockers bearing the names of
    other influential Canadian chapters on his colours.&nbsp; Mr. Bonner had
    graduated from the position of prospect to become a full member.&nbsp; It
    is a reasonable inference and one that I draw, that both men were well aware
    of what the organization was about, including its composition and characteristics,
    globally and specifically as it existed in
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    and in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario.&nbsp; In particular, both men knew the HAMC’s reputation for violence
    and intimidation.&nbsp; They deliberately invoked their membership in the
    HAMC with the intent to inspire fear in their victim.&nbsp; They committed
    extortion with the intent to do so in association with a criminal organization,
    the HAMC to which they belonged. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Crown has established the element of “in association
    with” beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><a name=JJ></a>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants assert that the following facts belie this analysis: the appellants
    did not make explicit reference to the Hells Angels in their conversations
    with M.M., the Hells Angels clothing they wore to the two meetings was simply
    their ordinary attire, and a proper analysis of the circumstances surrounding
    the two meetings should have cast doubt on their intent to link their criminal
    activities with the criminal organization to which they belonged.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    disagree.  The trial judge carefully and comprehensively reviewed all the

    after giving credit for 20 months (10 months on a 2:1 basis) of pre-trial
    custody.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lindsay
    acknowledges that, by virtue of s. 718.2(a)(iv) of the <i>Code</i>, evidence
    that the offence was committed in association with a criminal organization
    is an aggravating factor on sentencing.  However, he contends that the trial
    judge overemphasized this factor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Again,
    I disagree.  The effects of the extortion <i>by members of the Hells Angels</i> on
    M.M.’s family have been devastating.  As described by the trial judge in
    her reasons for sentence:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The wife of Mr. M. provided a victim impact statement,
    in which she described the devastating impact of the events on the members
    of the M. family, including the children.  They were compelled to leave their
    home on the sudden, and ultimately to obtain secure identity changes.  They
    were required to relinquish their identities, move away from family and friends,
    forego all contact with them, and in Mrs. M.’s case, abandon her job and
    career prospects.  In Mrs. M.’s words, “we live in isolation from the rest
    of society”.  Fear is their constant companion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>Against the backdrop of this sad description, it would
    be wrong to say that the trial judge overemphasized the statutory aggravating
    factor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lindsay
    also takes issue with this passage of the trial judge’s reasons for sentence:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I am unable to agree with defence counsels’
    submission that Mr. Lindsay and Mr. Bonner should receive credit against
      any period of incarceration for the time they have been on judicial interim
      release bound by strict conditions.  The offenders are not youthful, nor
      has there been inordinate delay in the imposition of sentence, as in <i>R.
      v. P. (L.)</i> (2003), 172 C.C.C. (3d) 195 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) and <i>R. v. Ewanchuk</i> (2002), 164 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (Alta.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lindsay
    contends that this passage is inconsistent with the decision of this court
    in <i>R. v. Downes</i> (2006), 205 C.C.C. (3d) 488 wherein Rosenberg J.A.
    stated, at para. 33, “time spent under stringent bail conditions, especially
    under house arrest, must be taken into account as a relevant mitigating circumstance.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not accept this contention.  To begin, I observe that <i>Downes</i> was
    not released until shortly after the sentences were imposed in this case.  Moreover,
    the trial judge did consider Lindsay’s bail as a mitigating circumstance:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There are mitigating factors….I take into account
    that he has been bound by strict conditions of judicial interim release for
    33 months, without incident.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, I point out that in <i>Downes</i>, in the passage immediately after
    the words relied on by Lindsay and quoted above, Rosenberg J.A. continued:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>However, like any potential mitigating circumstance,
    there will be variations in its potential impact on the sentence and the
    circumstances may dictate that little or no credit should be given for pre-sentence
    house arrest.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    it should not be forgotten that bail is the opposite of incarceration.  Accused
    persons almost always seek bail in order to stay out of jail until their
    trial: see <i>R. v. Panday </i>(2007), 226 C.C.C. (3d) 349 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) at para. 31.  Accordingly, although judges must consider bail on stringent
    conditions as a potential mitigating factor, it does not follow that credit
    in the form of a reduced sentence should always be given.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Taking
    these factors together, I see no error in the trial judge’s treatment of
    Lindsay’s pre-sentence bail circumstances.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>E. <u>DISPOSITION</u></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I

    appellants also challenged the constitutionality of s. 467.14, which provides
    that sentences for offences under ss. 467.11, 467.12 and 467.13 shall be
    served consecutive to any other sentence for an offence arising from the
    same event or series of events.  The trial judge reserved her ruling on s.
    467.14 to the end of the trial, at which time she dismissed the challenge.  The
    appellants do not appeal this ruling.</p>
