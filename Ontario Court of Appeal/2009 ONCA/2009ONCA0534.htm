  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><span lang=EN-US>By the Court:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the time of the order under appeal, Brute Manufacturing Ltd. (“Brute”), a
    manufacturer and assembler of large component pieces of heavy equipment,
    was a corporation subject to the <i>Companies’ Creditors Arrangement Act</i>,
    R.S.C. 1985, c.C-36, as amended (“CCAA”).  As part of the CCAA process, Brute
    sold its assets to the appellant, Clemmer Steelcraft Technologies Inc. (“Clemmer”),
    by way of an asset purchase agreement.  Title to all of the assets was transferred
    pursuant to a vesting order dated June 27, 2008, made by Morawetz J. within
    the CCAA process.  The asset purchase agreement closed on July 23, 2008.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Among
    the scheduled assets covered by the vesting order is a large spray booth
    and racking that Brute installed in premises it leased from the respondent,
    Northgate Properties Inc. (“Northgate”).  On July 31, 2008, Clemmer advised
    the president of Brute that it wished to remove the spray booth from the
    Northgate premises.  Later that day, a newly incorporated subsidiary of Brute,
    which intended to continue Brute’s business, entered into a new lease with
    Northgate for the express purpose of retaining the use of the spray booth
    and racking.  Northgate then took the position that the spray booth and racking
    were its property as landlord.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    response, the appellant Clemmer brought a motion for an order declaring that
    the equipment belongs to it, that it be permitted to enter the Northgate
    premises to remove the equipment and that neither Brute nor Northgate had
    any interest in the equipment.  There was no cross-motion for an order setting
    aside the vesting order in respect of the disputed equipment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge took the view that the vesting order did not restrict his ability
    to consider the question of who owned the assets.  He noted that the order
    vested only Brute’s title and interest in the assets in Clemmer.  He observed
    that “[i]f Brute did not have any title to the assets in dispute, the vesting
    order does not assist Clemmer.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge examined the original lease between Brute and Northgate and
    in particular s. 21 which provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>            All
    … Leasehold Improvements and fixtures upon the Demised Premises and which
    in any manner are or shall be attached to the floors, walls, ceiling or roof
    of the Demised Premises shall, upon the Commencement Date, become the sole
    property of the Landlord and, for purposes of greater certainty, provided
    that the Tenant shall be entitled to remove any fixtures or other Leasehold
    Improvements at or after the expiry or termination of this Lease in the Landlord’s
    and Tenant’s agreed discretion, and shall repair any damage occasioned by
    such installation or removal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge concluded that although the disputed equipment was a trade or
    tenant’s fixture, title to it had passed to the landlord under s. 21 of the
    lease. Consequently, he reasoned that because Brute did not have title to
    the equipment at the time of the vesting order, the vesting order could not
    pass title to Clemmer.  He also specifically found that Northgate’s interest
    in the equipment under para. 21 was not a security interest, but that full
    title had passed to the landlord.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Shortly
    before the oral argument of this appeal, the court was advised by counsel
    for the respondents that they would not be filing respondents’ factums, and
    that while they did not consent to the court allowing the appeal, they did
    not oppose the appeal. Counsel for the respondents attended the hearing and
    advised the court that they were taking no position on the appeal because
    there was no longer an interest in continuing with the manufacturing business
    of Brute.  Therefore, they were no longer concerned about the disputed equipment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, this appeal must be allowed, and the order of the motion judge
    set aside.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not agree with the motion judge’s reading of the vesting order.  The purpose
    of a vesting order made in the context of a CCAA proceeding is to effectively
    deal with the assets of the corporation and to obtain funds to pay creditors
    in accordance with the plan of arrangement, so that the corporation and all
    creditors can move forward.  The vesting order, read purposively as a whole,
    vested title to the assets in schedule 1.1 of the asset purchase agreement,
    including the spray booth and racking, in Clemmer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    effect of the order under appeal is to give rise to two inconsistent orders
    of the Superior Court, both of which remain outstanding.
     One vests the disputed equipment in the appellant and one declares that
    the appellant has no interest in the disputed equipment.  These two orders
    cannot stand together.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect, the motion judge could not have dismissed the motion without setting
    aside or varying the vesting order, nor should he have entertained the respondents’ arguments
    on the motion in the absence of a motion to set aside or vary the vesting
    order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
    if the motion judge could consider setting aside or varying the vesting order
    without a motion that he do so, the record before him was inadequate for
    that purpose.  At the very least, the reports of the Monitor in the CCAA
    process should have been before the court and the Monitor and its counsel
    should have been made parties to the motion.  The record did not indicate
    what was provided to Morawetz J. when the original vesting order was made
    regarding Brute’s interest in the equipment or Northgate’s interest.  Counsel
    advised the court that the Monitor provided Northgate with a notice to all
    creditors in October, 2007, but not with the CCAA application record or the
    motion for the vesting order.  We do know that Northgate received notice
    of the vesting order from Clemmer, but took no steps to set it aside.  Rather,
    it refused to allow Clemmer to enforce the order.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Therefore,
    in any event, the motion judge could not have set aside or varied the vesting
    order on the record that was before him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    order of the motion judge dismissing the motion is set aside.  The vesting
    order remains in full force and effect. The motion is remitted to the Commercial
    List for rehearing on a full record, if the parties wish to proceed.  On
    the rehearing, the respondents may bring a cross motion to set aside or vary
    the vesting order.  If they do so and the matter is considered afresh, nothing
    in these reasons should be taken as approving of  the motion judge’s conclusion
    that s. 21 of the lease should not be read as granting the landlord nothing
    more than a security interest in the property. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Costs
    of the appeal to the appellant fixed at $7,500, inclusive of GST and disbursements,
    and payable jointly and severally by the respondents.</p>
