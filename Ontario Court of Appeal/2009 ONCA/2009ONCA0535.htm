  <h2>II.        Background</h2>
  <h2>            (1)       New Limousine Licensing Scheme</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    decades, the limousine industry in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto has been regulated by a municipal licensing scheme established by
    the City.  Under the By-laws, this scheme provides for three types of limousine
    licences: (i) a limousine owner licence, which entitles the licensee to own
    a limousine and to pick up passengers in the City for transportation to any
    destination; (ii) a limousine driver licence, which authorizes the licensee
    to drive, but not to own, a licensed limousine to pick up passengers in the
    City for transportation to any destination; and (iii) a business licence
    for limousine service companies (“LSCs”).  As defined under the By-laws,
    a limousine is any automobile other than a taxicab, including a stretch or
    sedan luxury vehicle, that meets minimum size criteria set by the City and
    that is used “for hire for the conveyance of passengers in the City”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>From
    1986 to 2005, the City imposed a “cap” of 375 limousine owner licences in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto (the “Cap”).  Since the Cap limited its ability to grow, the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto limousine industry lobbied extensively for many years to persuade
    the City to remove the Cap. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>These
    lobbying efforts eventually bore fruit.  In 2001, the City embarked on a
    major review of its limousine licensing scheme.  On July 21, 2005, after
    several years of study and consultations, the City enacted By-law 706-2005
    under the authority of the <i>Municipal Act</i>, <i>2001</i>, S.O. 2001,
    c. 25 (the
    “<i>Municipal Act</i>”).  By-law 706-2005, which became effective on September
    1, 2005 and was subsequently amended by By-laws 217-2006 (enacted March 30,
    2006), 1417-2007 (enacted December 13, 2007), and 230-2008 (enacted March
    5, 2008), is the cornerstone of the City’s current limousine licensing regime
    and the primary focus of the issues on appeal.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    By-laws introduced significant changes to the City’s former limousine licensing
    scheme.  Under By-law 706-2005, the Cap was removed and replaced by criteria
    to be met by prospective licensees.  Among other things, By-law 706-2005:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>(i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>requires
    all owners of licensed limousines to register their vehicles with and to
    operate through a LSC under a service level agreement.  It also obliges LSCs
    to maintain identified business records at a central place of business that
    is accessible during regular business hours (collectively, the “LSC Requirements”);</p>

  <h2>IV.       Discussion</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants advance two jurisdiction complaints.  First, they contend that
    the <i>Municipal Act</i>, rather than the <i>Toronto Act</i>, governs the
    question of the City’s jurisdiction to pass the By-laws and that the City
    exceeded its statutory authority under the <i>Municipal Act</i> in enacting
    the By-laws.  If that argument fails, the appellants next submit that in
    passing certain specific provisions of the By-laws, the City exceeded the
    scope of its jurisdiction.  I will address these arguments in turn.  </p>
  <h2>            (1)       Challenge to the</h2>
  <h2>                        By-laws as a Whole</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    the outset, I note that the application judge stated in her reasons: “The
    applicants did not contend that the impugned provisions [of the By-laws]
    exceeded the City’s statutory powers.”  Contrary to this statement, the appellants
    claim that their jurisdiction challenge was a live issue before the application
    judge.  The City does not contest this assertion and the question of the
    City’s statutory authority to pass the By-laws was fully argued before this
    court.  Further, the fresh as amended notice of application before the application
    judge included a challenge to the City’s jurisdiction to pass the By-laws
    under the <i>Municipal Act</i>.  As this notice was delivered in July 2006,
    it contained no reference to the <i>Toronto Act</i>, which was not yet in
    force.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    these circumstances, I am satisfied that the issue whether the City had jurisdiction
    to enact the By-laws was joined by the parties and that it is properly before
    this court for determination.   I therefore turn to the merits of this ground
    of appeal.</p>
  <h2><i>(i)        Governing Statutory Framework</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, the first branch of the appellants’
    jurisdiction complaint, by which they attack the By-laws as a whole, must
    fail.  The contention that the <i>Municipal Act</i> governs the City’s authority
    to pass the By-laws is inconsistent with the <i>Municipal Act</i>, as amended
    on enactment of the <i>Toronto Act</i>.  It is also inconsistent with the
    purpose and the express provisions of the <i>Toronto Act</i>.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    January 1, 2007, the same day that the <i>Toronto Act</i> became effective,
    s. 7.1(1) of the <i>Municipal Act</i> came into force.<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[3]</span></span></span></a>  Section 7.1(1) provides that the <i>Municipal
    Act</i> does not apply to the City
    “except as otherwise provided by another provision of the [<i>Municipal Act</i>]
    or of the [<i>Toronto Act</i>]”.  There is no suggestion that this exception
    is engaged in this case.  Accordingly, on the introduction of s. 7.1(1),
    the <i>Municipal Act</i> ceased to apply to the City and was replaced by
    the <i>Toronto Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The <i>Toronto
      Act</i>, in turn, contains several transitional provisions, two of which
      are especially relevant in this case.  Section 419(2) of the <i>Toronto
      Act</i> provides that a provision of that statute, for which there is a
      corresponding provision of the <i>Municipal Act</i>, and the enactment
      of s. 7.1 of the <i>Municipal Act</i> are deemed to constitute the substitution
      of the provision of the <i>Toronto Act</i> for the corresponding provision
      of the <i>Municipal Act</i>.  The effect of s. 419(2), for example, is
      to continue the City’s by-law making authority, formerly established by
      the <i>Municipal Act</i>, under the <i>Toronto Act</i>. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    addition, s. 419(4) of the <i>Toronto Act</i> expressly addresses the effect
    of that statute on by-laws enacted by the City under the <i>Municipal Act</i>.  Pursuant
    to s. 419(4), if a by-law that was in effect immediately before January 1,
    2007 was made by the City under a provision of the <i>Municipal Act</i> for
    which there is a corresponding provision of the <i>Toronto Act</i>, the by-law
    remains in effect and is deemed to have been made by the City under the corresponding
    provision of the <i>Toronto Act</i>.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Under
    the <i>Municipal Act</i>, the City was empowered to license, regulate and
    govern any business carried on within the City (s. 150(1)).  By virtue of
    s.&nbsp;150(2) of the <i>Municipal Act</i>, the City was required to only
    exercise its licensing powers under s. 150(1), including its power to impose
    conditions, for one or more of the following purposes: “1. Health and safety.
    2. Nuisance control. 3. Consumer protection.”  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    under s. 150(8) of the <i>Municipal Act</i>, the City’s power “to license,
    regulate and govern a business” by by-law included the power: “to prohibit
    the carrying on of or engaging in the business without a licence” (s. 150(8)(a)); “to
    refuse to grant a licence or to revoke or suspend a licence”
    (s. 150(8)(b)); “to define classes of businesses and to separately license,
    regulate and govern each class” (s.&nbsp;150(8)(d)); and “to exempt any business
    or person from all or any part of the by-law” (s. 150(8)(j)), among other
    matters.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    City’s regulatory authority was significantly expanded under the <i>Toronto
    Act</i>.  Indeed, as the application judge observed, the <i>Toronto Act</i> affords
    the City “sweeping powers”.  As I have mentioned, s. 2 states in part that
    the purpose of the <i>Toronto Act</i> is “to create a framework of broad
    powers for the City”, which recognizes that the City must be able, among
    other things, to: (i) “[d]etermine what is in the public interest for the
    City”
    and (ii) “[r]espond to the needs of the City”, in order “to provide good
    government”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section
    8(2) of the <i>Toronto Act</i> vests the City with broad powers to make by-laws,
    including by-laws regarding business licensing.  This provision states in
    part:  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The City may pass by-laws respecting the following
    matters:</p>

    City also enjoys statutory authority under the <i>Toronto Act</i> to provide
    for a system of business licences.  Section 86(1) authorizes the City to
    prohibit the carrying on or engaging in a business without a licence (s.
    86(1)(a)); to refuse to grant a licence or to revoke or suspend a licence
    (s. 86(1)(b)); to impose conditions as a requirement of obtaining, continuing
    to hold or renewing a licence (s. 86(1)(c)); to impose special conditions
    on a business in a class that have not been imposed on all of the businesses
    in that class in order to obtain, continue to hold or renew a licence (s.&nbsp;86(1)(d));
    and to license, regulate or govern real and personal property used for a
    business and the persons carrying it on or engaged in it (s. 86(1)(f)).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

    the purpose of the

    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    <i>Toronto</i><i> Act</i> expressed in s. 2, the effect of ss. 8(2) and 86(1)
    of the <i>Toronto Act</i> is to grant wide authority to the City to pass
    business licensing by-laws that advance the public interest and respond to
    the needs of the City.  Under the express language of s. 8(2), those by-laws
    may relate to consumer protection, the economic and social well-being of
    the City, and the health, safety and well-being of persons in the City.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Importantly,
    the powers conferred on the City by the <i>Toronto Act</i> attract an expansive
    and deferential interpretation.  Section 6(1) of the <i>Toronto Act</i> contains
    the following blunt legislative directive:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The powers of the City under this or any other Act
    shall be interpreted broadly so as to confer broad authority on the City
    to enable the City to govern its affairs as it considers appropriate and
    to enhance the City’s ability to respond to municipal issues.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Section
    6(1) of the <i>Toronto Act</i> is far-reaching.  It applies to the City’s
    general power to make by-laws under s. 8(2) and its specific power under
    s. 86(1) to establish business licensing systems.  Furthermore, by its terms,
    s. 6(1) is stated to apply to the powers of the City “under this or <i>any
    other Act</i>” (emphasis added).  Thus, the expansive interpretive approach
    mandated by s. 6(1) also applies to the construction of the scope of the
    City’s statutory powers under the <i>Municipal Act</i>.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    effect of these provisions, in my opinion, is that the City’s statutory authority
    to license, regulate and govern the limousine industry – previously conferred
    under the <i>Municipal Act</i> – is now continued and expanded by the <i>Toronto
    Act</i>.  Further, by the combined effect of s. 7.1(1) of the <i>Municipal
    Act</i> and ss.&nbsp;419(2) and (4) of the <i>Toronto Act</i>, the By-laws
    are deemed to be governed by the <i>Toronto Act</i>.  Accordingly, the issue
    whether the City acted within the scope of its statutory authority in passing
    the By-laws must be determined by reference to the <i>Toronto Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    am fortified in this conclusion by an additional compelling factor.  If the
    appellants’ contention that the <i>Municipal Act</i> governs the By-laws
    was to be accepted, it would result in the continuing application of two
    separate statutory regimes – the <i>Municipal Act</i> and the <i>Toronto
    Act</i> – to the City’s exercise of its by-law making powers, including its
    business licensing jurisdiction.  This would give rise to potential confusion,
    uncertainty and inconsistency regarding the source and limits of the City’s
    regulatory jurisdiction in respect of a host of businesses, including the
    limousine industry.  There is nothing in either statute that directs or even
    suggests this legislative intention.  On the contrary, the clear and unambiguous
    language of s. 7.1(1) of the <i>Municipal Act</i> and s. 419 of the <i>Toronto
    Act</i> suggests precisely the opposite.</p>
  <h2><i>(ii)       Bad Faith Claim</i></h2>

    did not understand the appellants to dispute the wide cast of the City’s
    powers under the <i>Toronto Act</i>.  Rather, they submit that the City did
    not act in good faith in passing the By-laws, with the result that it had
    no jurisdiction to enact them.  I do not accept this submission.      </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Under

    213 of the <i>Toronto Act</i> states: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><i>A by-law of the City</i> or a local board of
    the City <i>passed in good faith under any Act shall not be quashed or open

    ), at para 61, this court indicated that bad faith by a municipality “connotes
    a lack of candour, frankness and impartiality.  It includes arbitrary or
    unfair conduct and the exercise of power to serve private purposes at the
    expense of the public interest” (citations omitted).</p>

    public notice and consultation process concerning the By-laws and held that
    it was “indicative of a careful approach to the City’s powers of regulation” and “bespeaks
    the absence of both bad faith and arbitrariness”.  </p>

    see <i>Equity Waste, </i>at pp. 333-34.  I see no basis on which to conclude
    that the application judge’s finding of an absence of bad faith by the City
    is tainted by palpable and overriding error.   </p>

  <h2>(2)       Challenge to Specific </h2>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This,
    however, does not end the matter.  As advanced during oral argument before
    this court, the appellants impeach three particular aspects of the By-laws:
    (i) the Minimum Fare Requirement; (ii) the LSC Requirements; and (iii) the
    Ratio Requirement (collectively, the “Challenged Provisions”).  They argue
    that the Challenged Provisions are arbitrary and oppressive; that there is
    no rational connection between the Challenged Provisions and the City’s legitimate
    statutory objectives; and that the Challenged Provisions unfairly favour
    the taxicab industry over the limousine industry.  Therefore, the appellants
    submit, the application judge erred by failing to quash the Challenged Provisions
    on the basis that they are unreasonable or illegal.</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span

    City accepts that a municipal by-law may be quashed if it was passed in bad
    faith.  The City also acknowledges that bad faith may be found where a municipal
    council has acted “unreasonably and arbitrarily and without the degree of
    fairness, openness, and impartiality required of a municipal government”:
    see <i>Equity Waste</i>, at pp. 343-45, citing <i>Re H.G. Winton Ltd. and

    the City asserts that the Challenged Provisions cannot be quashed on the

    for alleged unreasonableness.  The appellants bore the onus to establish
    that the City acted in bad faith in enacting the By-laws: see <i>Boyd Builders, </i>at
    pp. 412-13; <i>Equity Waste</i>, at p. 343.  On the application judge’s findings,

    the appellants also claim that the application judge erred by failing to
    quash the Challenged Provisions under s. 214(1) of the <i>Toronto Act</i> on
    the ground of illegality.  Section 214(1) reads: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Upon the application of any person, <i>the Superior

    assertion of illegality, reasoning as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In my opinion, each of the impugned by-law provisions
    related to a legitimate concern in terms of regulating the limousine industry.  This
    regulation does not occur in a vacuum.  The City also regulates the taxi
    industry.  Its goal of ensuring that each industry can operate in the public
    interest is rational.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To
    begin, the examination of the legality of the Challenged Provisions must
    proceed in light of the generous, deferential standard that applies to appellate
    review of the exercise of municipal powers: see <i>Equity Waste</i>, at p.
    339, citing <i>Howard and Toronto (City) (Re)</i> (1928), 61 O.L.R. 563 (C.A.)
    and <i>Shell Canada Products Ltd. v. Vancouver (City)</i>, [1994] 1 S.C.R.

    respect the responsibility of elected municipal bodies to serve the people
    who elected them and exercise caution to avoid substituting their views of
    what is best for the citizens of those municipal councils”: <i>Shell Canada</i>,
    at para. 19.  Further, this approach to the interpretation of municipal powers
    presumes that municipal by-laws are validly enacted absent a clear demonstration
    that the by-law in question exceeds the municipality’s powers: see <i>Ontario
    Restaurant Hotel &amp; Motel Assn. v. Toronto (City)</i>, [2005] O.J. No.

    Toronto.  The evidential record supports the City’s claim, detailed in its
    factum, that the City “was cognizant of the need to balance the interests
    of the two industries to prevent the limousine industry from being flooded
    with additional operators, potentially to the ultimate detriment of the travelling
    public and the City as a whole”. </p>

    this context, it was for the City, acting within its authority under the <i>Toronto
    Act</i>, to determine what measures for the regulation of the limousine industry
    are in the public interest.  So long as the measures chosen are not arbitrary
    and are rationally connected to a legitimate municipal objective, the court
    is precluded from second-guessing City Council on what regulatory measures
    are in the public interest of the citizens of the City.  As this court explained
    in <i>Howard and Toronto</i> at p. 567:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>What is or is not in the public interest … is a
    matter to be determined by the judgment of the municipal council; and that
    what it determines, if in reaching its conclusion it [acted] honestly and
    within the limits of its powers, is not open to review by any court.  [Citations

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this case, the <i>Toronto Act</i> specifically empowers the City to differentiate
    between licence holders when passing by-laws in the exercise of its business
    licensing and other powers under s. 8(2).  Section 10(1) of the <i>Toronto
    Act</i> reads:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Without limiting the generality of section 6 and
    except as otherwise provided, <i>a by-law under this Act</i> may be general
    or specific in its application and <i>may differentiate in any way and on
    any basis the City considers appropriate</i>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[49]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus,
    the City had the statutory power to take steps, by by-law, that advantaged
    the taxicab industry over the limousine industry, so long as the City acted
    honestly in so doing and the steps taken were rationally connected to a legitimate
    municipal objective.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[50]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third,
    there can be no sustainable complaint concerning the Challenged Provisions
    on the basis that they oblige limousine owners or drivers to undertake specific
    actions or to operate their businesses in ways expressly delineated by the
    City.  As I have said, the City’s powers under the <i>Toronto Act</i> to
    regulate businesses includes the power to impose conditions as a requirement
    of obtaining, holding or renewing a licence (s.&nbsp;86(1)).  See also <i>United

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the end, the appellants’ real complaint in this case is that the Challenged
    Provisions are arbitrary and that they are not rationally connected to legitimate
    City concerns regarding the regulation of the limousine industry.  The application
    judge rejected this contention.  In my view, she was correct to do so.  I
    say this for the following reasons.</p>
  <h2><i>(i)        Minimum Fare Requirement</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Virtually
    from the outset of the development of potential by-law amendments to remove
    the Cap, the City proposed the establishment of a minimum hourly fare for
    limousine services.  From at least January 2002, a minimum hourly fare was
    called for in City staff and committee reports regarding reform of the City’s
    limousine licensing scheme.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    proposal also formed part of various regulatory measures discussed with representatives
    of the limousine and taxicab industries at meetings and workshops held by
    the City prior to the enactment of By-law 706-2005.  Indeed, the minutes
    of a meeting held with representatives of those industries on March 4, 2005
    suggest that the participants in the meeting agreed on a minimum fare of
    $60 per hour for the first two hours or part thereof of limousine services.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[55]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    City staff report to the Planning and Transportation Committee of City Council
    dated April 1, 2005 identified the following rationale for the Minimum Fare
    Requirement:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Concern has been raised relative to the similarity
    between livery service and the service provided by taxicabs in the City.  Taxicab
    operators are concerned that livery vehicles will compete for their business.  The
    introduction of a minimum fare for livery service that is well above the
    average taxicab fare and the pre-arranged fare provisions will deter direct
    competition between the two modes of transportation service.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[56]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    recitals to By-law 706-2005, as subsequently amended by By-law 1417-2007,
    accord with the rationale for the Minimum Fare Requirement advanced by City
    staff.  They include the following statement: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Whereas a minimum rate for limousine transportation
    services is necessary to deter direct competition between limousines and
    taxicabs and to establish and maintain a clear distinction between limousine
    transportation services and taxicab transpor-tation services;</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Consistent
    with this rationale, Bruce Robertson (“Robertson”), the Director of the City’s
    Licensing Services, Municipal Leasing and Standards Division, swore in his
    affidavit filed on the application that the objective of the Minimum Fare
    Requirement was “to discourage fly-by-night operators and to maintain the
    distinction between the taxi and limousine industries”.  He also said that
    the City’s Licensing Sub-Committee ultimately settled on a minimum hourly
    fare of $70 on the basis of the exercise of its judgment and information
    received from one of the largest limousine companies in the City that it
    charged $85 per hour.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[58]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus,
    the record supports the conclusion that the Minimum Fare Requirement is directed
    at a legitimate municipal goal – the regulation of competition between the
    limousine and taxicab industries in the City, in the public interest.  In
    my view, it was for the City to determine the appropriate quantum of such
    a measure.  On this record, it cannot be said that the Minimum Fare Requirement
    is arbitrary or irrational.</p>
  <h2><i>(ii)       LSC Requirements</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[59]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    reach a similar conclusion regarding the LSC Requirements.  By-law 706-2005
    offers the following justification for the LSC Requirements: “WHEREAS [LSCs]
    will ensure a level of accountability to the public for the arrangement of
    limousine service, ensuring all limousines used in their companies comply
    with the <i>Municipal Code</i> provisions”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[60]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    accountability focus of the LSC Requirements was also emphasized by the City’s
    Commissioner of Urban Development Services in a report to the Planning and
    Transportation Committee of City Council dated April 1, 2005:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The recommendation to create a new licence category
    for companies that provide livery service, separate from driver’s and owner’s
    licences, will establish a level of accountability for these types of businesses
    and provide higher standards of consumer protection.  The companies will
    be responsible for ensuring the pre-arrangement of fares, for ensuring vehicles
    used in their business are inspected, insured and properly licensed, and
    for maintaining proper records of all requests for service.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    his affidavit, Robertson reiterated that the requirement that all limousine
    owners and drivers enter into a service agreement with a LSC was intended
    to ensure a level of accountability to the public for businesses that arrange
    and provide limousine services in the City.  Further, he said that the City
    sought to impose requirements that would “facilitate investigation and enforcement
    to ensure greater compliance with the City’s licensing requirements”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Robertson
    also deposed that before the introduction of the LSC Requirements, limousines
    generally operated in the City through a company or brokerage that received
    customer telephone calls and arranged trips.  Consequently, Robertson indicated: “[A]s
    a practical matter, the creation of a license requirement for [LSCs] and
    the requirement that limousines do business through a [LSC] simply formalized
    the general manner in which limousines operated to being with.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[63]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    his affidavit sworn on May 31, 2007 in support of the application, Danylevich
    suggested that after the introduction of LSCs, “some brokerages began to
    increase the charges payable by livery vehicle owners to operate”.  But the
    appellants have been unable to point to any evidence of usurious administrative
    or other fees charged by LSCs to individual limousine drivers or owners or
    any other LSC-imposed measure that has restricted the ability of limousine
    vehicle drivers or owners to carry on business.  On this record, there appears
    to be no firm evidence of the overcharging of limousine drivers or owners
    by LSCs.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[64]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    the evidence suggests that the LSC Requirements have not frustrated the ability
    of limousine drivers and owners to obtain licences or to carry on business.  As
    of February 2008, 668 limousine owner licences and 950 limousine driver licences
    had been issued under the By-laws.  In contrast, as of August 31, 2005, 305
    limousine owner licences (out of a potential 375 such licences) and 726 limousine
    driver licences had been issued by the City.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    evidence undercuts the appellants’ claim that the LSC Requirements have had “the
    effect of denying most individuals who would have wished to become part of
    the livery industry legally the opportunity to do so”.  On the contrary,
    as sought by the limousine industry, the By-laws appear to have resulted
    in a material relaxation of the pre-2005 limits on the growth of the limousine
    industry and the number of limousine licences actually made available in
    the City.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Nor
    does the evidence support the appellants’ submission that the requirement
    for LSCs to maintain specific business records at a central office location
    is arbitrary or unconnected to a valid City regulatory objective.  On the
    evidence, this requirement is intended: (i) to ensure that the City’s zoning
    by-laws are respected by requiring that limousine businesses be conducted
    from locations zoned for that use; and (ii) to facilitate investigations
    into any offence under the By-laws by requiring that business records be
    maintained and made available for inspection at designated places of business.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    conclude that there was ample evidential support for the application judge’s
    holding of a rational connection between the LSC Requirements and the regulation
    of the limousine industry in the public interest.  There was evidence before
    the application judge demonstrating that the LSC Requirements are linked
    to the health, safety and well-being of members of the travelling public
    and, more generally, to consumer protection.</p>
  <h2><i>(iii)     Ratio Requirement</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[68]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    turn now to the Ratio Requirement, which deals with the number and type of
    vehicles required to be operated by LSCs.  This provision of By-law 706-2005,
    as amended by By-law 1417-2007, obliges LSCs to maintain and operate, as
    a minimum licensing requirement, service agreements for at least one stretch
    vehicle and two sedan vehicles and thereafter, to operate a fixed number
    of stretch vehicles in proportion to the number of sedan vehicles operated
    (<i>e.g.</i> one stretch vehicle for up to four sedans and one stretch vehicle
    for each six additional sedan vehicles) in order to obtain and hold a limousine
    owner licence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[69]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Danylevich’s
    complaints regarding the Ratio Requirement were outlined in his May 2007
    affidavit.  In that affidavit, he alleged that the Ratio Requirement “makes
    no rational, economic or legal sense”.  In support of this allegation, he
    maintained that: (i) the mandatory purchase of a stretch limousine is “financially
    ruinous” given (a) the high costs of a stretch limousine (approximately $100,000
    to $135,000 per unit), (b) the declining consumer demand for stretch limousine
    services, and (c) the fuel costs for such vehicles; and (ii) the application
    of the Ratio Requirement to existing smaller limousine business owners – such
    as Danylevich – (a) will result in “very little legitimate expansion of small,
    closely held independent livery businesses”, (b) will force such limousine
    operators “to drive for a brokerage, and pay dues and rentals for so doing”,
    (c) will reduce the number of new licences issued and “create a vicious cycle
    of failed livery businesses”, and (d) will force small or independent limousine
    operators out of business and into a service agreement and contract with
    an existing broker.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[70]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    application judge rejected these complaints, stating:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><i>The ratio of stretch limousines to sedans is
      designed to limit the number of limousines.</i>  Although other means might
      have been selected, <i>the goal of limitation is a rational one</i>.  [Emphasis
      added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[71]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    City defends the Ratio Requirement primarily on the ground that it was intended
    to reduce a flood of new limousine licence applicants on removal of the Cap.  The
    City maintains that a flood of new applicants: (i) might have led to an increase
    in the number of vehicles operating as limousines to improperly circumvent
    the City’s taxicab licensing requirements; and (ii) might, as well, have
    had deleterious effects on the limousine industry to the disadvantage of
    the travelling public.  The City says that both of these scenarios, if realized,
    would result in consequential adverse effects on the economic well-being
    of the City.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[72]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    City also emphasizes that the grandfathering provision of By-law 217-2006
    was intended “to ensure an orderly transition period for those who owned
    limousines as at May 19, 2005” and, further, “to minimize potential disruption
    in services to the public”.  In reality, the City submits, the attack on
    the Ratio Requirement is designed to achieve a broader exemption from the
    Ratio Requirement than is contemplated by the grandfathering concession agreed
    to by the City.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[73]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    agree with the application judge that the Ratio Requirement addresses a “goal
    of limitation” – that is, the control of the number of limousines in the
    City.  For several reasons, I also agree that, on this record, the Ratio
    Requirement cannot be said to be irrational or arbitrary.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[74]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    on the City’s evidence, the Ratio Requirement is directed at consumer protection,
    public safety and the economic well-being of the City.  In its factum, the
    City described the link between these legitimate municipal objectives and
    the Ratio Requirement in this fashion:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>From the City’s perspective, a flooding of the transportation
    industry by newly licensed limousines had the potential to negatively impact
    customer service and public safety because the City considered there to be
    a correlation between good driving and good service and the economics of
    the industry.  Too many drivers driving for too little business encourages
    drivers and owners to cut corners, by not properly maintaining vehicles,
    driving aggressively and dangerously, or failing to provide good customer
    service, in order to make money; all of which compromises public safety and
    consumers. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[75]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    as outlined in the April 1, 2005 report by the City’s Commissioner of Urban
    Development Services to the Planning and Transportation Committee of City
    Council, the introduction of the Ratio Requirement was tied to the removal
    of the Cap and the core feature of the City’s new limousine licensing scheme – the
    creation of LSCs as a device to “establish a level of accountability for
    [limousine service] businesses and provide higher standards of consumer protection”.  In
    that context, the express goal of LSCs was to “ensure that livery service
    is provided by full-service businesses and not independent operators of one
    vehicle.  As a minimum requirement to obtain a licence, a company will be
    required to [abide by the Ratio Requirement]”.  Further, “[T]he recommendation
    that luxury sedans meeting specific criteria can only be licensed as livery
    vehicles in conjunction with stretched vehicles will establish criteria for
    legitimate livery operations in the City, as [distinct] from the taxi business.”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[76]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Ratio Requirement is also intended to prevent “bandit” or unlicensed limousine
    operators from continuing to operate in the City and to ensure that full-service
    limousine services are made available to the public by established operators
    under controlled conditions.  These objectives of the Ratio Requirement were
    detailed in a December 8, 2005 staff report to the Planning and Transportation
    Committee, in which the grandfathering provision introduced under By-law
    217-2006 was also recommended:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[The Ratio Requirement is] intended, in part, to
    allow unlicensed limousine activity that has been operating in the city for
    several years to come under the regulatory framework.  The vehicle ratios
    are designed to ensure that these new companies [LSCs] are legitimate operators
    who are providing full limousine service to the community.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[77]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    evidence indicates that the Ratio Requirement is integrally linked to the
    removal of the Cap and the new LSC business licence system introduced by
    the City.  This system, in turn, is designed to maintain the distinction
    between taxicabs and limousines, to deter competition between the taxicab
    and limousine industries in the City, to ensure that limousine services are
    offered by full-service operators who meet high standards of consumer protection
    and business regulation set by the City, and to control and deter limousine
    operators who previously operated without authority to do so.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[78]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Reasonable
    people might disagree on the choice of the Ratio Requirement as a control
    measure for the purposes advanced by the City.  However, I am unable to conclude
    that it is arbitrary or unconnected to valid City objectives or that the
    purposes for which it was introduced, as articulated by the City, are outside
    the boundaries of legitimate City concerns.  There is support in the evidential
    record for the City’s claim that the Ratio Requirement is rationally related
    to public safety, consumer protection and the economic well-being of the
    City.  These are valid regulatory objectives in respect of which the City,
    in the exercise of its discretion, may pass by-laws under the authority of
    s. 8(2) of the <i>Toronto Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[79]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third,
    I note that the establishment of the Ratio Requirement was not a surprise
    development in the City’s overhaul of its limousine licensing scheme.  As
    I have said, the City’s review of its pre-2005 licensing scheme commenced
    in 2001.  Like the Minimum Fare Requirement, the recommendation by City staff
    that limousine vehicles be registered with the City according to a stretch
    limousine-sedan ratio formula had emerged from at least January 2002 and
    was an item for discussion at various public consultation and workshop meetings
    held by the City with representatives of the limousine and taxicab industries
    thereafter.  Those meetings eventually led to the grandfathering exemption
    from the Ratio Requirement provided for under By-law 217-2006.  Danylevich
    made submissions to the City’s Planning and Transportation Committee concerning
    the proposed grandfathering exemption from the Ratio Requirement.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[80]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    as I have said, deference is owed to the decisions of City Council as to
    how best to regulate the limousine industry and to balance the competing
    interests of the limousine and taxicab industries in the City.  As the appellants
    fairly conceded during oral argument, it was open to the City to retain the
    previous Cap or to impose a new and different cap.  It was also open to the
    City to decline to exempt any limousine licence holder from the Ratio Requirement.  It
    chose not to do so, opting instead for an integrated limousine licensing
    scheme that incorporates a variety of controls on the provision of limousine
    services and the number of limousines in the City.  The Ratio Requirement
    is but one of these.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[81]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly,
    for the reasons given, I would not give effect to the appellants’ attack
    on the Ratio Requirement.</p>

    conclude with three observations.  First, as I have indicated, the <i>Toronto
    Act</i> confers express authority on the City to differentiate by by-law “in
    any way and on any basis the City considers appropriate” (s.&nbsp;10(1)).  The
    application judge essentially concluded that in invoking its statutory authority
    to differentiate between licence holders and between the limousine and taxicab
    businesses in the City, the City did not act contrary to the public interest
    or in an arbitrary or capricious manner.  I am not persuaded that in so holding,
    the application judge misapprehended the evidence or otherwise erred.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    I reiterate that, on the findings of the application judge, the City did
    not act in bad faith in passing the By-laws.  In particular, its notice and
    consultation process was not inadequate, contrary to the City’s procedural
    by-law, or discriminatory in the manner alleged by the appellants.  In these
    circumstances, no breach of s. 15(1) of the <i>Charter</i> nor any procedural
    unfairness was made out.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third,
    I cannot accede to the appellants’
    argument that the By-laws offend the provisions of the <i>Competition Act</i>.  The
    regulation of the limousine business in the City is a <i>bona fide</i> municipal
    objective, authorized by statute.  Incidental to the City’s power to regulate
    this business is the implicit power to consider and regulate competition
    between the limousine and taxicab businesses in the City, in the public interest.  See
    for example, <i>Associated Cab Limousine Ltd. v.
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Calgary (City)</i> (2006), 390 A.R. 82 (Alta. Q.B.).   </p>

    would dismiss the appeal.  I would award the City its costs of the appeal
    in the total amount of $10,000, inclusive of disbursements and GST, as agreed
    by counsel.  There is no basis to interfere with the application judge’s
    costs award in favour of the City.</p>
