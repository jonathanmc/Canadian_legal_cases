  <h4><span lang=EN-US>I.          OVERVIEW</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>EnerNorth
    Industries Inc. is bankrupt.  Its various creditors are squabbling amongst
    themselves over the amount owing to one of them, Oakwell Engineering Limited.  To
    sort this out, the appellant creditors sought to obtain an order under s.
    135(5) of the <i>Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</i>, R.S.C. 1985, c. B-3 (the “<i>BIA”</i>),
    entitling them to challenge and determine the validity of the proof of claim
    filed by Oakwell.  That proof of claim is founded upon a judgment rendered
    in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Singapore</st1:country-region>
    prior to EnerNorth’s assignment in bankruptcy.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Justice
    Colin Campbell dismissed the creditors’ motion on <i>res judicata</i> and
    issue estoppel grounds, holding that the very issue they wished to have determined
    had already been decided in the proceedings before the courts in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Singapore</st1:country-region>
    .  In my view, he was correct in arriving at this conclusion, and I would
    dismiss the appeal for the reasons that follow.</p>
  <h3 style='page-break-after:avoid'>II.        FACTS</h3>
  <p style='
page-break-after:avoid'><b>The Genesis of the Problem</b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>EnerNorth
    and Oakwell were parties to a joint venture agreement concerning the construction
    and operation of two power plants in the State of
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Andhra Pradesh in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>
    .  They incorporated a company (the “Project Company”) to finance, construct
    and operate the Project.  EnerNorth held an 87.5% interest, and Oakwell a
    12.5% interest, in the Project Company.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Project did not develop according to plan and various disputes arose between
    the parties.  The disputes were ultimately resolved in December 1998, by
    way of a Settlement Agreement in which EnerNorth agreed to buy out Oakwell’s
    interest in the Project Company.  In exchange, EnerNorth was to pay Oakwell: </p>
  <p>(1)       1.85 million EnerNorth shares, in lieu of payment of approximately
    US$3 million;</p>
  <p>(2)       US$2.79 million, payable within 30 days after successful financing
    of the Project (“Financial Closure”); and</p>
  <p>(3)       a royalty equivalent to 6.25% of the actual cash flow of the Project
    Company for the first five years of its commercial operation, according to
    a formula set out in the Settlement Agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Under
    the Settlement Agreement, both parties agreed to do all things necessary
    to give effect to the agreement.  They also agreed that any disputes would
    be governed by
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Singapore</st1:country-region>
    law and subject to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Singapore</st1:country-region>
    courts.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>EnerNorth
    did not achieve Financial Closure.  Although it transferred the 1.85 million
    shares to Oakwell, it never paid Oakwell either the $2.79 million or the
    6.25% annual royalty.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>EnerNorth’s
    inability to realize Financial Closure and to make the payments under the
    Settlement Agreement was attributable to the fact that EnerNorth – perhaps
    in recognition of its inability to complete the Project – sold <i>its</i> interest
    in the Project Company (including the newly-acquired Oakwell portion) to
    another group of companies known as The VBC Group, in August 2000.  I will
    refer to the August 2000 Agreement between EnerNorth and the VBC Group as “the
    VBC Agreement”.  Although Oakwell had been aware of VBC’s interest in the
    Project, it was initially unaware of the VBC Agreement.  When it discovered
    what had occurred, it protested to VBC and entered into negotiations with
    VBC directly, arguing that EnerNorth and VBC were not entitled to exclude
    it completely from the Project under Indian law because of its position as
    Original Promoter of the Project.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> These
    negotiations led to a series of agreements between Oakwell and the VBC Group
    (including the Project Company) on July 4, 2001.  Principal amongst these
    was a Technology Transfer, Collaboration and Licence Agreement (“the Licence
    Agreement”) pursuant to which the Project Company was to pay Oakwell “technical
    fees” totalling US$6 million “in acknowledgement of the technical services
    and know-how provided and to be provided by [Oakwell] since 1995” and for
    the granting of a certain licence.  Of the $6 million, $2 million was to
    become payable on registration of the Licence Agreement with the Reserve
    Bank of
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>
    .  The other $4 million was payable in respect of technical services in the
    event they were required after signing the Licence Agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> It
    is the payments made, or to be made, under this Licence Agreement, and how
    they were treated before the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Singapore</st1:country-region>
    courts, that provide the grist for the dispute on this appeal.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    August 2002, Oakwell sued EnerNorth in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Singapore</st1:country-region>
    to recover the outstanding amounts under the Settlement Agreement, and other
    damages for the breach of the Settlement Agreement.   EnerNorth defended
    the suit arguing, in part, that the Licence Agreement was a sham and that
    payments made under it were simply camouflaged substitutions for the very
    payments Oakwell was alleging EnerNorth owed it under the Settlement Agreement.  They
    submitted, for example, that the $2 million payment paralleled the $2.79
    million called for on Financial Closure under the Settlement Agreement, less
    credit for a payment of US$790,000 made by EnerNorth to the order of Oakwell
    in July 1999 to discharge certain debts owing by Oakwell to various third
    parties in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>
    .  The remaining $4 million was to satisfy the royalty obligation under the
    Settlement Agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    this Court, Oakwell insists that any payments received, or to be received,
    by it under the Licence Agreement are separate and apart from its claim against
    EnerNorth arising out of the Settlement Agreement and that this issue has
    already been determined in its favour in the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Singapore</st1:country-region>
    proceedings.  The appellants –
    EnerNorth’s creditors – argue here that the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Singapore</st1:country-region>
    proceedings are not dispositive.  As EnerNorth did in the Singapore proceedings,
    they assert that any payments received by Oakwell as a result of the Licence
    Agreement are, in effect, a substitute for the Settlement Agreement payments,
    and must therefore be deducted from any amounts owing by EnerNorth to Oakwell
    in relation to the Settlement Agreement; in the result, there would be more
    money to be distributed amongst the appellant creditors.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    returning to this debate, I turn briefly to a history of the legal proceedings
    between EnerNorth and Oakwell, and a history of the bankruptcy proceedings
    involving the appellant creditors.</p>

  <h3 style='page-break-after:avoid'><u><span style='font-weight:normal'>The
        Trial Proceedings</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Singapore</st1:country-region>
    proceedings, Oakwell alleged that EnerNorth had (i) breached its obligation
    under the Settlement Agreement to achieve Financial Closure, and (ii) repudiated
    the Settlement Agreement by entering into the VBC Agreement.  It claimed
    damages of US$2.79 million, representing the sum due on Financial Closure
    (less credit for two offset amounts discussed below), and damages for loss
    of the 6.25% annual royalty fees.  These issues were all determined in Oakwell’s
    favour:  <i>Oakwell Engineering Limited v. Energy Power Systems Limited</i>,
    [2003] SGHC 241.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>EnerNorth’s
    defence – as set out in its pleadings and in its opening and closing submissions
    at trial – was to argue: </p>
  <p>(a)       that the Settlement Agreement had been frustrated as a result
    of a reduction in tariffs imposed by the Indian Government and reducing the
    amounts payable to the Project Company, thus rendering Financial Closure
    impossible and the performance of the Project economically non-viable;</p>
  <p>(b)       if the Settlement Agreement had not been frustrated, that EnerNorth
    had not breached or repudiated it; and that,</p>
  <p>(c)       even if EnerNorth had breached or repudiated the Settlement Agreement,
    Oakwell had suffered no damages because Oakwell had mitigated its losses
    by entering into the Licence Agreement with VBC – any past or future payments
    received from VBC under the Licence Agreement would have to be set-off against
    any payments payable by EnerNorth under the Settlement Agreement (the “mitigation/set-off
    issue”).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    addition, EnerNorth counterclaimed that Oakwell had breached the Settlement
    Agreement by entering into the Licence Agreement with VBC, in effect selling
    the same interest in the Project to VBC that was to be relinquished to EnerNorth
    as part of the Settlement Agreement.  Accordingly, EnerNorth sought an order
    requiring Oakwell to disgorge any and all “shares, monies or other benefits”
    received, or to be received in the future, under the Licence Agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    the exception of two voluntary credits offered by Oakwell, the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Singapore</st1:country-region>
    trial judge rejected EnerNorth’s defences in their entirety and dismissed
    its counterclaim.  The first voluntary reduction consisted of the US$790,000
    payment referred to above.  The second – which takes on some significance
    for the purposes of this appeal – was a payment of US$350,000 made by VBC
    to Oakwell under the Licence Agreement prior to the commencement of the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Singapore</st1:country-region>
    action.  Oakwell conceded that both of these amounts should be credited to
    EnerNorth in the proceedings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

    Appeal</span></u></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>EnerNorth
    unsuccessfully argued the same issues in its appeal before the Singapore
    Court of Appeal, including the mitigation/set-off issue.  In its written
    appeal case brief, it contended that, “If [EnerNorth] did repudiate the Settlement
    Agreement on or before 10 August 2000, Oakwell mitigated its losses.”  The
    appeal case argued:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>One of [the] ways that Oakwell agreed to receive
    the Royalty under … the Settlement Agreement was by entering into an agreement
    directly with the Project Company [i.e., the Licence Agreement with VBC]
    whereby the company would pay Oakwell “as technical or consultancy fees” an
    amount equal to the Royalty.  One of the agreements Oakwell entered into
    on 4 July 2001 was an agreement with the Project Company whereby Oakwell
    would receive a lump sum as a “Technical Fee”.  <i>Accordingly, Oakwell contracted
    directly with the Project Company for the very thing it had agreed to accept
    from the Project Company under the Settlement Agreement</i>.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Therefore, even if [EnerNorth] had breached the
    Settlement Agreement on 10 August 2000, in respect of the Royalty, Oakwell
    had <i>fully mitigated its losses by directly entering into the very contract
    with the Project Company that under the Settlement Agreement it had agreed
    to accept as payment for the Royalty</i>. </p>
  <p align=center style='
text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Oakwell, in other words, had a duty to mitigate
    its (claimed) losses arising out of [EnerNorth’s] repudiation of the Settlement
    Agreement (if indeed that is what [EnerNorth] did) and Oakwell did in fact
    mitigate its losses by conveying the interests it had relinquished to [EnerNorth]
    under the Settlement Agreement to VBC for valuable consideration.  <i>Therefore,
    the Court erred by awarding damages to Oakwell in these circumstances and
    in effect gave Oakwell double recovery.</i></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[Emphasis added.]</p>

    dismissed the motion to quash after argument of the motion.  Given the reach
    of the appellants’ position that s. 135(5) applicants have an “unqualified
    right” to attack the validity of any judgment issued by a court of competent
    jurisdiction in a hearing under that section, the implications of the appeal
    are widespread and the order or decision is likely to affect other cases
    of a similar nature in the bankruptcy proceedings: s. 193(b).  Even if that
    were not the case, however, we were satisfied that the property involved
    in the appeal exceeds $10,000 in value.  The test for the value of property
    involved in the appeal is the amount of the loss or gain which the granting
    or refusal of the claimed right would entail: <i>Orpen v. Roberts</i>, [1925]
    S.C.R. 364, at p. 367; <i>Fallis v. United Fuel Investments Limited</i>,
    [1962] S.C.R. 771, at p. 774.  Here, the loss or gain to Oakwell or to the

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[37]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    135 of the <i>BIA</i> deals with a trustee’s examination, acceptance or disallowance
    of proofs of claim filed by creditors in bankruptcy proceedings.  Subsection
    135(1) provides that the trustee is to examine proofs of claim or of security
    and the grounds therefore and “may require further evidence in support of
    the claim or security.”  Subsection 135(2) deals with the right of the trustee
    to disallow a claim, and subsections 135(3) and (4) provide for notice of
    that determination and for finality and conclusiveness of that decision subject
    to an appeal from the trustee’s decision.  Subsection 135(5) states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Expunge or reduce a proof</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>135(5)<b> </b>The court may expunge or reduce a
    proof of claim or a proof of security on the application of a creditor or
    of the debtor if the trustee declines to interfere in the matter.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[38]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants’ argument that they have “an unqualified right” to challenge Oakwell’s
    proof of claim under s. 135(5) is based on the unsupported theory that the <i>only</i> precondition
    to a creditor being entitled to a hearing under s. 135(5) is that the trustee
    must have declined to interfere in the matter.  I do not read the provision
    in such a restricted manner.  Their premise that the Singapore judgment cannot “displace” their “unqualified” right,
    is founded on quite old English authority which – if it ever stood for the
    proposition advanced – should no longer be followed, in my view.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the first of these decisions, <i>Re Fraser; Ex parte Central Bank of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    London</i>, [1892] 2 Q.B. 633 (C.A.), at pp. 635-637, Lord Esher M.R. said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>As a matter of law the judgment, therefore, stands
    as a good judgment against John Fraser, and it cannot be questioned by him
    in any Court, except the Court of Bankruptcy. … The mere fact that there
    is a judgment for the debt does not prevent the registrar from saying that
    there is no good petitioning creditor’s debt.  The Court of Bankruptcy can
    go behind the judgment, and can inquire whether, notwithstanding the judgment,
    there was a good debt.  In so doing, the Court of Bankruptcy does not set
    aside the judgment.  If I may use the expression, the Court goes round the
    judgment, and inquires into the subject-matter.
    … The existence of the judgment is no doubt <i>prima facie</i> evidence of
    a debt; but still the Court of Bankruptcy is entitled to inquire whether
    there really is a debt due to the petitioning creditor.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[40]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lord
    Justice Kay concurred, at pp. 637-638, saying:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is old law in bankruptcy that, neither upon
    an attempt to prove a debt, nor upon a petition for an adjudication of bankruptcy
    or a receiving order against a debtor, is a judgment against him for the
    debt conclusive. … Can this judgment be treated as conclusive in bankruptcy
    because the debtor has unsuccessfully attempted to set it aside?  I think
    not, and I cannot see how the matter is any more res judicata because there
    has been an unsuccessful appeal to this Court.  I agree in all that the Master
    of the Rolls has said on this point.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Later,
    in <i>Re Van Laun; Ex parte Chatterton</i>, [1907] 2 K.B. 23 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), Cozens-Hardy M.R. adopted a similar approach.  At p. 29, he said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[I]f a judgment had been obtained upon the covenant,
    it is competent and it is the duty of the Court of Bankruptcy to go behind
    the judgment, to open the judgment and to say, “That is the judgment, but
    the creditor can only prove for the amount which is justly and truly due
    upon it.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    language adopted by the Master of the Rolls, the trial judge in <i>Re Van
    Laun</i> had said, at [1907] 1 K.B. 155, at pp. 162-163:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The trustee’s right and duty when examining a proof
    for the purpose of admitting or rejecting it is to require some satisfactory
    evidence that the debt on which the proof is founded is a real debt.  No
    judgment recovered against the bankrupt, no covenant given by or account
    stated with him, can deprive the trustee of this right.  He is entitled to
    go behind such forms to get at the truth, and the estoppel to which the bankrupt
    may have subjected himself will not prevail against him.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    I accept the first statement of Cozens-Hardy M.R. cited above, with respect
    to those eminent jurists, I disagree with the balance of their sweeping statements.  They
    cast the net of the trustee’s ability to assess a proof of claim based upon
    the judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, and the court’s ability
    to expunge or reduce such a proof, too broadly.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lord
    Esher M.R., himself, suggested as much in an earlier decision, <i>Re Flateau;
    Ex parte Scotch Whisky Distillers, Limited</i>, [1888] 22 Q.B. 83 (C.A.),
    at p. 85.  In that case, the bankruptcy was based upon a judgment debt which
    was under appeal.  The registrar in bankruptcy refused to adjourn the bankruptcy
    petition pending the outcome of the appeal.  His decision was affirmed by
    the Court of Appeal.  On the issue of the right to re-try the issues in Bankruptcy
    Court, Lord Esher M.R. said, on that occasion (at p. 85):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is not necessary now to repeat that, when an
    issue has been determined in any other court, if evidence is brought before
    the Court of Bankruptcy of circumstances tending to shew that there has been
    fraud, or collusion, or miscarriage of justice, the Court of Bankruptcy has
    power to go behind the judgment and to inquire into the validity of the debt.  <i>But
    that the Court of Bankruptcy is bound in every case as a matter of course
    to go behind a judgment is a preposterous proposition</i>.  [Emphasis added.]  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the same decision, Lopes L.J. was equally succinct, at p. 87:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It has been argued that the registrar was bound
    to hear evidence upon issues <i>which had been already tried</i> by a judge
    and jury, and that he had no discretion in the matter.  In my opinion such
    a contention cannot be for a moment maintained.  Proceedings in bankruptcy
    are already scandalously long; if this contention were well founded they
    would be almost interminable.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[46]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    other decisions, English authorities have distinguished <i>Re Fraser</i> and
    its progeny on the basis that it involved a default judgment where there
    had been no determination of the claim on the merits: see e.g. <i>Re a Debtor</i> (1915),
    113 Law Times 704 (K.B.), at p. 705.  I note as well, that <i>Re Van Laun </i>involved
    a default judgment.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Re
      Canada Asian Centre Developments Inc. </i>(2003), 39 C.B.R. (4th) 35 (B.C.S.C.),
      at para. 26, Burnyeat J. drew the same distinction, noting that the comments
      of Cozens-Hardy M.R. in <i>Re Van Laun</i> were obiter.  Lord Justice Fry
      made the point in <i>Re Flateau</i>, at p. 86, as well:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It is true that in some cases the Court of Bankruptcy
    has gone behind a judgment, when it has been obtained by fraud, collusion,
    or mistake.  But this power has never, so far as I am aware, been extended
    to cases in which a judgment has been obtained after issues have been tried
    out before a Court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    see no basis for holding that an applicant pursuant to s. 135(5) of the<i> BIA</i> should
    have
    “an unqualified” right to challenge the validity of a judgment debt that
    is based on a decision of a court of competent jurisdiction on the merits
    of the claim or that <i>res judicata</i> should not apply, where appropriate,
    in such circumstances.  Take, for example, the case of a debtor with $10
    million in assets and judgment debts spread amongst five creditors of $5
    million each.  Suppose that each $5 million judgment debt resulted from lengthy
    and costly litigation from trial, through intermediate appeal to the Supreme
    Court of Canada and that the debtor has failed at each stage.  As EnerNorth
    did here, the debtor makes an assignment in bankruptcy following its last
    loss in the highest court.  It surely contravenes every imaginable principle
    of judicial economy, finality and fairness to say that the Bankruptcy Court
    can now, indiscriminately, re-open each hotly contested dispute in order
    to satisfy itself, in its own mind, that
    “there really is a debt due to the … creditor” (<i>Re Fraser</i>) or that “the
    debt on which the proof is founded is a real debt” (<i>Van Laun</i>).  I
    do not accept such a proposition.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree that the trustee’s power to allow or disallow a proof of claim, and
    the court’s power to expunge or reduce it on an application under s. 135(5)
    of the <i>BIA</i> is wide.  However, to say that the attacking creditor or
    debtor has an “unqualified” right to challenge the proof of claim where the
    claim is based upon a valid and enforceable judgment that is no longer subject
    to appeal is going too far.  The appellant’s submission goes beyond the proposition
    that a judgment creditor is precluded from making a “double recovery”, that
    is, that the Bankruptcy Court may examine whether the amount claimed in the
    proof of claim is the true amount remaining to be paid under the judgment.  The
    Bankruptcy Court may make such an enquiry.  But, in the absence of fraud,
    collusion or some legitimate concern that there has been a genuine miscarriage
    of justice, a judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction should almost
    invariably satisfy a trustee or a court regarding the legitimacy of a claim
    under s. 135 if, in awarding the judgment, the court has considered the merits
    of the claim: see <i>Re Canada Asian Centre Developments Inc.</i>, as cited
    in Lloyd W. Houlden, Geoffrey B. Morawetz and Janis P. Sarra, <i>The 2009
    Annotated Bankruptcy and Insolvency Act</i> (Toronto: Thomson Carswell, 2008),

    concerns: finality (it is in the interest of the public that an end be put
    to litigation); and fairness (no one should be twice vexed by the same cause).  The
    doctrine is part of the general law of estoppel and is said to have two central
    branches, namely,
    “cause of action estoppel” and “issue estoppel.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Cause
    of action estoppel refers to the determination of the cause or causes of
    action before the court.  The applicable form of <i>res judicata</i> in this
    case, however, is issue estoppel.  Issue estoppel prevents a litigant from
    re-litigating an issue that has been clearly decided by a court of competent
    jurisdiction in a previous proceeding between the same parties or their privies
    even if the new litigation involves a different cause of action.  As the
    Supreme Court of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    observed in <i>Danyluk v. Ainsworth Technologies Inc.</i>, [2001] 2 S.C.R.
    460, at para. 18:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>An issue, once decided, should not generally be
    re-litigated to the benefit of the losing party and the harassment of the
    winner.  A person should only be vexed once in the same cause.  Duplicative
    litigation, potential inconsistent results, undue costs, and inconclusive
    proceedings are to be avoided.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Canadian
    authorities confirm that <i>res judicata</i> may apply in bankruptcy proceedings,
    including those involving the establishment of a proof of claim.  In <i>Chaban
    v. Chaban (Trustee of)</i> (1999), 172 D.L.R. (4th) 312, the Saskatchewan
    Court of Appeal held that a trustee in bankruptcy was not permitted to resort
    to its power under s. 135(2) to disallow a claim (by the debtor’s father/mortgagee)
    that had already been determined in the father’s favour in previous proceedings.  Speaking
    for the Court, Chief Justice Bayda said, at para. 31:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Section 135(2) is an empowering provision<i>.  But
      the power vested in the trustee is not absolute.</i> … In my respectful
      view, the power cannot be invoked where to do so results in the reliance
      upon a procedure that conflicts with the procedure prescribed by a subsisting
      order of a superior court.  <i>Parliament did not intend s. 135(2) to be
      used by a trustee in those cases where to do so would amount to a collateral
      attack upon a subsisting order of a superior court or where it would amount
      to something akin to an abuse of process</i>. [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    Bankruptcy Court, acting under s. 135(5), is in no different a position than
    a trustee in bankruptcy in such circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Other
    Canadian decisions have also held that <i>res judicata </i>applies in bankruptcy
    proceedings.  In <i>Re Arnco Business Services Ltd</i>. (1983), 38 C.P.C.
    226 (Ont. H.C.J.), for example, judgment creditors petitioned for a receiving
    order and the debtor defended on the basis that the judgment underlying the
    claim that he was bankrupt should be set aside.  Gray J. refused, holding
    (amongst other things) that “the principle of <i>res judicata</i> can be
    raised as a bar to a subsequent bankruptcy proceeding” (p. 235).  If <i>res
    judicata</i> may be raised as a bar to the bankruptcy proceeding itself,
    it can be raised – where appropriate – in answer to a plea that a proof of
    claim should be disallowed, expunged, or reduced:  see also <i>Gibson Mining
    Co. v. Hartin</i>, [1940] 2 D.L.R. 605 (B.C.C.A.); <i>Re Grossman</i> (1998),
    222 A.R. 139 (Q.B.).</p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,
    the question is whether <i>res judicata</i> applies to preclude the appellants
    from asserting in the bankruptcy proceedings that monies received by Oakwell
    under the Licence Agreement, post-Singapore judgment, are to be set-off against
    monies owing by EnerNorth to Oakwell on the judgment awarding damages for
    breach of the Settlement Agreement, thus reducing or eliminating the Oakwell
    proof of claim in the bankruptcy.  For that to be the case, the same issue
    must have been decided by a court of competent jurisdiction in a prior proceeding
    involving the same parties or their privies.  The decision must have been
    final, fundamental in the sense that it was not collateral to the first proceeding,
    and made on the merits:  see <i>Carl Zeiss Stiftung v. Rayner &amp; Keeler
    Ltd. </i>(<i>No. 2</i>), [1967] A.C. 853 (H.L.), at p. 935; <i>Angle v.

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Two

    proceedings involve the same parties (<i>or their privies</i>) as the proposed
    s. 135 proceedings?  Secondly, was the mitigation/set-off issue determined
    in those earlier proceedings?  The other criteria are not at issue on this

      have involved the same parties or their privies.  Although Ms. Hall and
      Mr. Cassina were the President and Chairman of EnerNorth, respectively,
      at the time of the Singapore proceedings – indeed, Mr. Cassina was a witness
      for EnerNorth in the proceedings<b> </b>– the appellant group of creditors
      argues that its members were in no way involved, nor could they have been.  One
      of the criteria for the application of <i>res judicata</i> has accordingly
      not been met, they say.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not accept this argument.  While there is little authority directly on
    point, I am satisfied that Ms. Hall, Mr. Cassina, and the appellant group
    of creditors are all “privies” of EnerNorth for the purposes of the s. 135
    hearing analysis.  As officers of EnerNorth, Ms. Hall and Mr. Cassina were
    clearly aligned with its interests in the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Singapore</st1:country-region>
    proceedings, and in the present context continue to be so.  It is clear that
    directors and officers may be considered the privies of their companies:
    see, for example, Donald J. Lange, <i>The Doctrine of Res Judicata in Canada</i>,
    2d ed. (Markham, Ont.:  LexisNexis Canada Inc., 2994), at p. 79, citing <i>Bank
    of Montreal v. Maple City Ford Sales (1986) Ltd</i>. (2001), 51 O.R. (3d)
    523 (S.C.).  In the latter case, Gillese J. (as she then was) noted that
    to the extent that the former directors and a creditor of the bankrupt “come
    to this court to advance the claims of [the bankrupt] they are a privy” (p.
    525).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Gillese
    J. went on to observe, at p. 526, that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Privies within the context of the doctrine of <i>res
      judicata</i> means a situation where there is a sufficient degree of identification
      between two persons to make it just to hold that the decision to which

      is a party.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant creditors as a class fall within this description.  For purposes
    of the bankruptcy proceedings, the Trustee stands in the shoes of EnerNorth,
    and for purposes of the proposed s. 135(5) hearing, the creditors in effect
    stand in the shoes of the Trustee, because they seek to have the court do
    what the Trustee has declined to do.  They are
    “identified” with EnerNorth for purposes of the comparison between the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Singapore</st1:country-region>
    proceedings and the proposed s. 135(5) hearing, and there is a “community
    or privity of interest” between them in this regard: see George Spencer-Bower
    and Alexander Kingcome Turner, <i>The Doctrine of</i> <i>Res Judicata</i>,
    2d ed. (London: Butterworths, 1969), at p. 209.   The appellants are only
    entitled to argue that Oakwell’s proof of claim should be expunged or reduced
    if EnerNorth is entitled to make the mitigation/set-off claim.  As creditors,
    therefore, they have “a sufficient degree of identification” with EnerNorth’s
    claim in the
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Singapore</st1:country-region>
    proceedings “to make it just to hold that the decision to which one was a

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge concluded, at para. 22, that the appellants “seek to litigate
    precisely the issue that was before the Singapore Court, namely the entitlement
    of Oakwell to receive funds from VBC and at the same time pursue its entitlement
    under the Settlement Agreement against EnerNorth.”  In his view, “[t]he fact
    that the precise amount was not dealt with in the Singapore trial, apart
    from the concession in respect of $350,000, [did] not invalidate Oakwell’s
    entitlement under the judgment against EnerNorth.”  To permit the s. 135
    challenge to proceed would therefore violate the principles of <i>res judicata</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The

    the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Singapore</st1:country-region>
    proceedings and, indeed, that the trial judge specifically indicated that
    the issue was “not a matter before [him]”.  Alternatively, to the extent
    the issue may have been determined they say it was determined in EnerNorth’s
    favour because the trial judge in fact deducted the $350,000 that had been
    received by Oakwell from VBC to that point.  A review of the trial judge’s
    reasons in their entirety does not bear out this analysis, however.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is no doubt the mitigation/set-off issue was squarely before the trial judge.  It
    was raised in both the defence and counterclaim.  It was the subject of evidence.  It
    was argued in EnerNorth’s written submissions at the opening and the close
    of trial.  But was it decided?  That question is somewhat more difficult
    to answer.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is true that the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Singapore</st1:country-region>
    trial judge gave little direct consideration to the question of whether monies
    received by Oakwell from VBC under the Licence Agreement had to be deducted
    from monies received by Oakwell from EnerNorth under the Settlement Agreement,
    except simply to deduct the amount conceded by Oakwell.  He made no specific
    finding one way or the other on that point.  However, the appellants’ submission
    that he said the mitigation/set-off issue was not before him is not accurate.  What
    he said was that Oakwell’s claim that VBC had breached the Licence Agreement
    by failing to pay the remaining amount of $1,650,000 under that Agreement
    was “not a matter before [him].”  That issue is quite different than the
    mitigation/set-off issue as between <u>EnerNorth</u> and Oakwell.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Read
    as a whole, the trial judge’s reasons – and, more importantly, the judgment
    he rendered – reveal that he rejected the mitigation/set-off argument.  The
    judgment rendered does not make sense unless premised on the rejection of
    EnerNorth’s arguments by way of defence and counterclaim, in their entirety.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    example, at para. 69, the trial judge stated that
    “[Oakwell’s] claim against the VBC Group was to be settled by the payment
    of the sum of US$2 million <i>in respect of past technical services and any
    ongoing technical services and advice</i>, if required, which [Oakwell] rendered
    for the benefit of the Project Company since 1995”.  It necessarily follows
    that he accepted Oakwell’s position that the Licence Agreement and the Settlement
    Agreement dealt with different matters – that is to say, Oakwell had not
    mitigated its losses by entering into the Licence Agreement with VBC.  This
    conclusion is reinforced by the trial judge’s rejection of EnerNorth’s counterclaim
    that any monies or benefits received by Oakwell from VBC under the Licence
    Agreement had to be disgorged to EnerNorth.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    I cannot accept the appellants’ contention, based on the $350,000 reduction
    in damages, that the mitigation/set-off argument was decided in their favour.  If
    EnerNorth’s mitigation/set-off argument had actually been accepted, the judgment
    would not have required EnerNorth to pay – as it does – damages “less the
    sums of US$790,000 and US$350,000”.  The judgment would have provided for
    payment of damages <i>less any monies or benefits <u>received or to be received</u> by
    Oakwell under the Licence Agreement</i>.  It did not.  Viewed in this way,
    the judgment rendered is consistent only with the trial judge having rejected
    EnerNorth’s submissions on the mitigation/set-off issue that were clearly
    put before him.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    realize that the $350,000 deduction is at odds with the rejection of EnerNorth’s
    position.  However, I do not view it as either an acceptance of EnerNorth’s
    mitigation/set-off position (for the reasons outlined above) or an indication
    that he was only dealing with payments already received by Oakwell from VBC
    and leaving the issue of what was to be done with future payments to a future
    determination.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I read the judgment, the trial judge simply reduced the amount of the award
    by the two conceded amounts because Oakwell had voluntarily agreed to those
    reductions.  The trial judge made no finding that Oakwell was obliged to
    make the deduction or that any amounts received under the Licence Agreement
    should be set-off and, as I have explained, his judgment as a whole is incompatible
    with such a conclusion.  His judgment is very full and thorough.  In my view,
    it makes no sense for him to have rejected EnerNorth’s defence and dismissed
    its counterclaim – both of which he did – without also rejecting the mitigation/set-off
    argument.  I am not convinced that he left open to future proceedings the
    resolution of whether the bulk of the monies that were the subject of the
    debate (the US$1,650,000 and US$4 million) were to be set-off against the
    Settlement Agreement damages and/or disgorged.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the end, I am satisfied that the mitigation/set-off issue was both fully
    argued and determined in the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
