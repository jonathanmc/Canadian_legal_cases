  <h4><span lang=EN-US>OVERVIEW</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    two appeals, heard together, concern the interpretation of provisions in
    a directors and officers liability insurance policy regarding the allocation
    of Defence Costs, a defined term in the policy, in proceedings brought against
    persons insured under the policy.  The appellants challenge the decision
    of Campbell J. (the “application judge”), which dismissed their application
    for a declaration that the insurer is obligated to pay either 90 or 100 percent
    of their Defence Costs.   The Defence Costs relate to proceedings brought
    after the expiry of the policy period and allege conduct occurring both prior
    to and after the end of the policy period.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the request of the appellants, these appeals were expedited, and counsel
    have requested that we deliver our reasons expeditiously.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    have concluded that the insurance policy, as it relates to the allocation
    of Defence Costs, is ambiguous.  The conclusion we have reached results from
    a submission first made in oral argument on this appeal.  Were it not for
    that submission, we would have dismissed the appeal for the reasons set out
    below.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    the current state of the record provides little help in resolving the ambiguity.  Moreover,
    the parties assert different facts, most of which are not in evidence, in
    arguing for and against the application of the doctrine of <i>contra proferentem</i>.  In
    our view, it is desirable that this important case be decided on a more complete
    record. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, we have concluded that the preferable course is to order a new
    hearing of the application. We find this conclusion unfortunate because we
    are well aware of the urgency from the appellants’ point of view of having
    the issues raised on this appeal resolved one way or the other.  However,
    the delay is necessary to provide the parties with the opportunity to introduce
    evidence and provide argument that would assist with the resolution of the
    ambiguity.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    order to narrow the future proceedings, we have decided all of the issues
    other than the one giving rise to the ambiguity.  We expect that the parties
    will co-operate with one another in order to achieve a speedy resolution
    of the outstanding issue.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>BACKGROUND</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants are Frank Andrew Dunn and Douglas Beatty.  Although we recognize
    that there are a number of insurers listed as respondents, for the purpose
    of the discussion in these reasons, we refer to the insurers simply as “Chubb” or
    the “insurers”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    insurance policy in issue (the “2001 Policy”) was one of many issued by Chubb
    to Northern Telecom Limited (now Nortel Networks Corporation).  It covered
    the Policy Period from 1999 to 2001 (the “Policy Period”).  The 2001 Policy
    is a variant of a “claims made” policy.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>During
    the Policy Period, the appellants participated in certain conduct that became
    the subject of civil proceedings commenced in 2001 and 2002 (the “2001 Proceedings”).  Chubb
    acknowledges that the 2001 Proceedings triggered coverage under the 2001
    Policy.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    2004 and subsequent years, further proceedings were brought against the appellants.  These
    proceedings include civil cases as well as regulatory proceedings by the
    Ontario Securities Commission and the United States Securities and Exchange
    Commission.  All of these proceedings include allegations against the appellants
    by reason of their conduct in 2001 (the “2001 Conduct”) as well as their
    conduct in 2003 to 2004 (the “2003 Conduct”).  Counsel refer to these 2004
    and subsequent civil and regulatory proceedings as the Hybrid Proceedings.  All
    of the Hybrid Proceedings were commenced after the expiration of the Policy
    Period.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Chubb
    acknowledges that the 2001 Conduct pleaded in the Hybrid Proceedings triggers
    coverage under the 2001 Policy because a claim was made regarding the appellants’ 2001
    Conduct during the Policy Period.  Thus, Chubb accepts that it is responsible
    for 100 percent of the Defence Costs incurred by the appellants in the Hybrid
    Proceedings to the extent that those proceedings relate to the 2001 Conduct.  However,
    Chubb takes the position that it is not responsible for the appellants’ Defence
    Costs in the Hybrid Proceedings to the extent that those costs relate exclusively
    to the appellants’ 2003 Conduct.  As a result of taking the above position,
    Chubb has been paying 50 percent of the appellants’ Defence Costs for the
    Hybrid Proceedings.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge dismissed the appellants’
    application for a declaration that Chubb is responsible to pay either 90
    or 100 percent of the Defence Costs relating to the Hybrid Proceedings.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ISSUES</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    this appeal, the appellants advance three arguments.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    they argue that the application judge erred in failing to give effect to
    the allocation provisions contained in two endorsements to the 2001 Policy,
    which provide a specific allocation for Defence Costs in the case of claims
    that include both covered and uncovered matters.   The appellants submit
    that the endorsements are clear on their face and entitle them to either
    100 percent of their Defence Costs for the Hybrid Proceedings (assuming the
    claims are based on, arising from or in consequence of a “Securities Transaction”),
    or 90 percent otherwise.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    they argue that the application judge erred in failing to find that the particulars
    of the 2003 Conduct alleged in the Hybrid Proceedings were “Interrelated
    Wrongful Acts” with the 2001 Conduct and, as such, were all covered under
    the terms of the 2001 Policy.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    in the alternative to their first and second arguments, the appellants submit
    that the application judge erred in holding that the appellants had the burden
    of proving that a greater proportion than 50 percent of the Defence Costs
    was appropriate for coverage under the 2001 Policy.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h3>1.         The Allocation Provisions Issue</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Chubb’s
    responsibility for Defence Costs relating to the 2003 Conduct in the Hybrid
    Proceedings turns on the interpretation of Endorsements 3 and 10 of the 2001
    Policy.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    endorsements became effective on the same date and replaced s. 12 of the
    2001 Policy.  Section 12 was entitled “Allocation”.  It provided that if
    both “<b>Loss </b>covered and loss not covered” were incurred, “because a <b>Claim</b> against
    the <b>Insured Persons</b> includes both covered and uncovered matters”,
    the parties would use best efforts to agree upon a fair and proper allocation
    between “covered <b>Loss </b>and uncovered loss” (emphasis in original).  Section
    12 further provided that if the parties could not agree on an allocation,
    Chubb would advance Defence Costs that it believed to be covered until a
    different allocation was negotiated, arbitrated or judicially determined.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Endorsements
    3 and 10 replaced the allocation scheme set out in s. 12 of the 2001 Policy.  Both
    endorsements provide for a fixed percentage allocation of Defence Costs for
    claims that include both covered and uncovered matters.  Endorsement 10 allocates
    100 percent of Defence Costs to covered loss in the case of a claim based
    on, arising from or in consequence of a “Securities Transaction”, as that
    term is defined in s. 2 of Endorsement 10.  Endorsement 3 allocates 90 percent
    of Defence Costs to covered matters in the case of claims that do not fall
    within the definition of a “Securities Transaction”.</p>
  <h3 style='page-break-after:avoid;
'>a)         <i>Ambiguity in Endorsement 3</i></h3>
  <h3 style='page-break-after:avoid;
'>&nbsp;</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    relevant part of Endorsement 3 reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If both <b>Loss</b> covered by this coverage section
    and <b>Loss</b> not covered by this coverage section are incurred, either
    because a <b>Claim</b> against an <b>Insured</b> <b>Person</b> includes both
    covered and uncovered matters or because a <b>Claim</b> is made against both
    an <b>Insured</b> <b>Person</b> and others, including the <b>Insured</b> <b>Organization</b>,
    the <b>Insureds</b> and the Company shall allocate such amounts as follows:</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a)       with respect to <b>Defence Costs</b>,
    to create certainty in determining a fair and proper allocation of <b>Defence
    Costs</b>, 90 % of all <b>Defence Costs</b> which must otherwise be allocated
    as described above shall be allocated to covered <b>Loss</b> and shall be
    advanced by the Company on a current basis…. [Emphasis in original.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    interpretation of Endorsement 3 and its application to the Hybrid Proceedings
    depends in part on the meaning of the term “Loss”.  Indeed, Chubb acknowledges
    that, but for the definition of “Loss” in the 2001 Policy, Endorsement 3
    would require Chubb to pay 90 percent of the appellants’ Defence Costs of
    the Hybrid Proceedings, including those aspects of the proceedings that relate
    to the 2003 Conduct.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    relevant part of the definition of “Loss” in the 2001 Policy reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>[T]he total amount which any <b>Insured</b> <b>Person</b> becomes
    legally obligated to pay on account of each<b> Claim</b> and for all <b>Claims</b> in
    each <b>Policy Period</b> and the Extended Reporting Period, if exercised,
    made against them for <b>Wrongful Acts</b> for which coverage applies, including,
    but not limited to, damages, judgments, settlements, costs and <b>Defence
    Costs</b>. [Emphasis in original.]  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Chubb
    argues that this definition limits the application of Endorsement 3 to claims
    made during the Policy Period and does not, therefore, cover claims arising
    from the 2003 Conduct.  Chubb sets out its argument in its factum as follows:  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The 90% Allocation Provision is inapplicable to
    the Hybrid Proceedings because it applies only to <b>Claims</b> first made
    during the 2001 Policy Period that give rise to <b>Loss</b> covered by the
    2001 Policy and loss not covered by the 2001 Policy.  None of the Hybrid

    appellants respond by arguing that the application of the definition of “Loss” to
    Endorsement 3 would render Endorsement 3 meaningless.  The definition of “Loss” in
    the 2001 Policy includes only amounts that an insured person becomes legally
    obligated to pay “<i>for which coverage applies</i>” (emphasis added).  Endorsement
    3 specifically provides for the allocation of costs in situations where there
    is a “Loss” for which there is no coverage.  Indeed, the whole purpose of
    Endorsement 3 is to allocate Defence Costs between covered and uncovered
    losses.  Thus, interpreting the contract as Chubb suggests would mean that
    there could be no “<b>Loss</b> not covered” and therefore no allocation.  The
    appellants submit that this interpretation would negate the overall purpose
    of the allocation provision, a result that could not have reflected the intention
    of the parties.<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Chubb
    acknowledges the difficulty in interpretation that is posed when applying
    the definition of “Loss” in the 2001 Policy to Endorsement 3.  However, it
    submits that the difficulty could be resolved by removing the words “for
    which coverage applies” from the definition of “Loss” when interpreting Endorsement
    3.  Indeed, this is the only solution that Chubb proposes to the interpretation
    dilemma.  Effectively, Chubb is asking the court to amend the definition
    of “Loss”
    in the 2001 Policy. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Chubb
    points out that the interpretation urged by the appellants would require
    ignoring a defined term in the 2001 Policy.  In this respect, it is interesting
    to note that the previous allocation provision – s. 12 of the 2001 Policy – referred
    to “<b>Loss</b> covered by this coverage section and loss not covered by
    this coverage section” and provided an allocation scheme for “covered <b>Loss</b> and
    uncovered loss” (emphasis in original).   Thus, in the original 2001 Policy,
    the word “loss”, as it related to uncovered losses, was neither bolded nor
    capitalized.  Hence, one could read into the term “<b>Loss</b>” in Endorsement
    3 some support, if any is needed, for the position that the parties intended
    the definition of “Loss”
    to be relied upon when interpreting the allocation provisions.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Chubb
    argues that the only way the definition makes sense is if it is amended as
    set out above.  The commercial reality, according to Chubb, is that once
    the parties moved to a fixed allocation for covered and uncovered matters,
    it made sense to limit the allocation to claims made during the Policy Period.  Otherwise,
    the allocation provision would be open-ended and would cover Defence Costs
    for claims against an insured brought years after the Policy Period had expired.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,

    Endorsement 3 without reference to the definition of “Loss” because to do
    so would render Endorsement 3 meaningless.  This would require ignoring the
    definition of the term “Loss” in Endorsement 3 (the appellants’ position);
    or</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span

    defeats the intentions of the parties and their objective in entering into
    the commercial transaction in the first place should be discarded in favour
    of an interpretation of the policy which promotes a sensible commercial result.
    It is trite to observe that <i>an interpretation of an ambiguous contractual
    provision which would render the endeavour on the part of the insured to
    obtain insurance protection nugatory, should be avoided. </i>Said another

    being critical, there is little evidence in the record to assist the court
    in resolving the interpretation dilemma identified on this appeal.  There
    is virtually no evidence about the context or the factual matrix within which
    the 2001 Policy or the endorsements were agreed to.  While both sides have
    urged that “commercial realities” support their interpretation, there is

    to assist with the resolution of the ambiguity.  Significantly, the difference
    in the parties’ positions results primarily from the different facts that
    the parties assert relating to the negotiations and the terms of the insurance

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[39]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants accept that the parties appear to have negotiated the removal
    of the previous allocation clauses and replaced them with Endorsements 3
    and 10.  They also accept that there may have been negotiations with respect
    to the premiums to be paid for the new arrangements.  However, the appellants
    go on to assert that there is no suggestion that Nortel or anyone on behalf
    of Nortel negotiated any of the contractual language in the body of the standard
    insurance policy, including the definition of “Loss”.  Nor is there any evidence
    that the parties negotiated the specific language used in Endorsements 3
    and 10.  Thus, the appellants’ position is that there may have been negotiations,
    but those negotiations were limited to the issues of percentages and premiums.  The
    appellants assert that the 2001 Policy is a standard policy, as are each
    of Endorsements 3 and 10.  As such, they argue that the 2001 Policy is a
    contract of adhesion.  They rely on case law,<a href="#_ftn6"

    proferentem</i> should not be applied against an insurer where the insured
    has participated in the negotiations of endorsements to an insurance policy.  Chubb
    also relies upon the passage from the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision
    in <span class=title><i>Canadian National Railway </i>at para. 33.  There,
    the</span> court spoke of the doctrine being inapplicable where the entire
    policy had been negotiated between sophisticated parties and pointed out

    of adhesion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[41]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    difficulty in both parties’ submissions is the lack of evidence necessary

    Policy or other relevant terms;  what matters were covered in the negotiations;
    the parties involved; or any other information that would assist in determining

    or not there is further evidence to assist with resolving the ambiguity,
    it seems obvious that the doctrine of <i>contra proferentem</i> will play
    an important role in the resolution of the interpretive issue arising from
    the allocation provisions in Endorsement 3.  Clearly, this is an important
    issue for these parties.  It is also an important issue for other cases where
    large and sophisticated parties contract for insurance coverage.  </p>

    wish to stress that the remedy in this case is unusual.  As noted, it arises
    from a submission that was advanced for the first time in oral argument on
    this appeal and from the parties’ different interpretation of facts that
    were not in evidence.  In our view, it would be inappropriate to decide this
    issue in the absence of a complete factual record that would enable the parties

    Proceedings are not “based on, arising from, or in consequence of” the purchase
    or sale of Nortel securities.  Rather, as Chubb argues, the Hybrid Proceedings
    are based on the appellants’ alleged improper accounting treatment of Nortel’s

    argument that the definition of “Loss” limits Endorsement 3 to allocating
    losses for covered and uncovered matters to claims made during the Policy
    Period.  In effect, the appellants argue that the 2001 Conduct and the 2003
    Conduct are “Interrelated Wrongful Acts” (s. 8) or claims arising from the
    same circumstances (s. 10).  As such, they argue that the Hybrid Proceedings
    include only claims made during the Policy Period.  That being the case,
    the appellants argue that the definition of “Loss” does not operate to exclude
    the claims in the Hybrid Proceedings relating to the 2003 Conduct from the
    operation of Endorsement 3.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We

    of the definition of “Loss” as it applied to Endorsement 3.  For different
    reasons, counsel said that it did not.  As a result, we have not taken into
    consideration the amendment to the definition of “Loss” found in Endorsement
    10.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    raise this point at this stage to say that we thought it might be argued
    that the amendment to the definition of “Loss” forms part of the entire 2001
    Policy.  If that were the case, it also might be argued that the definition
    of “Loss”, as amended, is consistent with an approach that when Defence Costs
    are being allocated between covered and uncovered losses, the definition
    of “Loss” in the 2001 Policy should not be applied to uncovered losses.  If
    that were the case, uncovered losses would not be limited by the requirement
    in the definition of “Loss” that they be on account of claims made in the
    Policy Period.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not raise this point at this time to suggest that the amendment to the
    definition of “Loss” in Endorsement 10 should determine the issue or even
    that it is relevant to the resolution of the ambiguity.  We do so only so
    that the parties and the court hearing the reapplication may consider whether
    or not there is any assistance to be gleaned from that amendment.</p>
  <h4><span
lang=EN-US>2.         Interrelated Wrongful Acts</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    this ground of appeal, the appellants argue that the 2003 Conduct that is
    pleaded in the Hybrid Proceedings is covered by the 2001 Policy on two bases.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    they argue that the 2003 Conduct is the same as, or is interrelated to, the
    2001 Conduct on the basis of s. 8 of the 2001 Policy.  Section 8 provides
    coverage for
    “<span style='line-height:200%'>all <b>Loss</b> arising out of the same <b>Wrongful
    Act</b> and all <b>Interrelated Wrongful Acts</b>” (emphasis in original).</span> “<span style='line-height:200%'>Wrongful
    Act” is broadly defined to include the type of conduct at issue in the Hybrid
    Proceedings, including misleading statements. “Interrelated Wrongful Act” is
    defined to mean “all causally connected <b>Wrongful Acts</b>” (emphasis in
    original).</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the appellants argue that the 2003 Conduct is conduct that was “subsequently
    arising from” the 2001 Conduct within the meaning of s. 10 of the 2001 Policy.  Section
    10 provides for coverage where a claim after the Policy Period arises from
    circumstances about which the insured gave notice during the Policy Period<span style='line-height:200%'>.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    essence, these arguments are both based on the premise that the 2003 Conduct
    arose out of, was causally connected to, or was the same as the 2001 Conduct.  In
    support, the appellants point to various broad-based allegations in the Hybrid
    Proceedings, including the Ontario Securities Commission’s allegation that
    the appellants displayed a “culture of non-compliance” throughout the whole
    period.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Broad
    language can usually be chosen to describe a wide variety of allegations
    of misconduct.  However, in our view, a reading of the allegations in the
    Hybrid Proceedings shows that the 2003 Conduct is different in nature, in
    kind, and in time from the 2001 Conduct alleged in the same proceedings.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    allegations of the 2003 Conduct relate to different acts of non-compliance
    than the 2001 Conduct and to acts that took place at different time frames
    and in different ways.  The allegations are specific in describing the different
    acts.  For example, the Securities and Exchange Commission proceedings allege
    that the appellants were involved in two fraudulent accounting schemes, which
    are explained as comprising a Revenue Recognition scheme based on the 2001
    Conduct and a different Provisioning scheme based on the 2003 Conduct.  The
    distinction between the parameters of the conduct and the two time frames
    is further illustrated by recent criminal charges which involve allegations
    restricted to the 2003 Conduct.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    we reject this ground of appeal.  </p>
  <h4><span
lang=EN-US>3.         Larger Costs Issue </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    this ground of appeal, the appellants challenge the application judge’s finding
    that “in the absence of evidence to the contrary”, it was reasonable for
    Chubb to pay them 50 percent of the Defence Costs of the Hybrid Proceedings
    in relation to the 2001 Conduct covered under the 2001 Policy.  The application
    judge made this finding because the appellants did not call evidence that
    the 2001 Conduct consumed more than 50 percent of the costs of the Hybrid
    Proceedings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants argue that the application judge erred in failing to apply the
    decision of this court in <i>Hanis v. Teevan</i> (2008), 92 O.R. (3d) 594.  They
    submit, based on <i>Hanis</i>, that Chubb is obliged to pay any defence costs
    reasonably related to the defence of the 2001 covered claims, even if those
    costs also relate to the defence of any 2003 uncovered claims. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    argument is consistent with <i>Hanis</i> where Doherty J.A. stated at para.
    2, “the insurer is required to pay all reasonable costs associated with the
    defence of those claims even if those costs further the defence of uncovered
    claims.”  However, Doherty J.A. continued to explain at para. 2 that the
    insurer “is not obliged to pay costs related solely to the defence of uncovered
    claims.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, on the state of the current record, and for our reasons relating
    to the Interrelated Wrongful Act argument, this case appears to be one where
    the Defence Costs can be separated into costs relating to the 2001 Conduct
    and costs relating to the 2003 Conduct.  This does not appear to be a case
    where the same costs are being incurred for both covered and uncovered claims:
    see <i>Hanis</i> at paras. 25, 42. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[65]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the appellants argue that the onus was on Chubb to establish which Defence
    Costs relate to the covered claims and which relate to the uncovered claims.  On
    this issue, we agree with the observation of Doherty J.A. in <i>Hanis </i>at
    para. 43, that there does not appear to be “any compelling reason to depart
    from the general rule that the party claiming damages bears the ultimate
    or legal burden of proof on that issue, including proving the quantum of
    damages suffered.”  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[66]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge resolved this issue by observing that Chubb, in the absence
    of evidence to the contrary, had allocated 50 percent of the Defence Costs
    to the Policy Period.  He left it open to the appellants to demonstrate,
    to the satisfaction of Chubb or the court, that a greater percentage was
    appropriate and stated in his reasons that his order could be amended accordingly.  We
    are of the view that in the event that the appellants are ultimately unsuccessful
    on the allocation provisions issue, the approach taken by the application
    judge is appropriate. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    we reject this ground of appeal.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>DISPOSITION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, we allow the appeal and direct a new hearing of the application
    to be limited in accordance with these reasons.  Given the result, we make
    no order as to the costs of this appeal and leave that issue to the judge
    rehearing the application.  However, to assist with respect to the amount
    of the costs to be awarded with respect to the appeal, we fix the costs as
    follows. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[69]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    the appellants are eventually successful, we would have awarded costs on
    a partial indemnity basis.  The appellants argued in their costs submissions
    that the insured “is entitled to all his or her costs on a substantial (or
    full) indemnity basis in an action against an insurer who denies coverage”.  Substantial
    indemnity costs may be appropriate in cases where the issue on appeal is
    whether the insurer had a duty to defend: see <i>M.(E.) v. Reed</i>, [2003]
    O.J. No. 1791 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  However, where the issue on appeal involves the allocation of costs between
    the insurer and the insured, as in this case, costs are awarded on a partial
    indemnity basis: see <i>Hanis v. University of Western Ontario</i>, 2008
    ONCA 793; <i>Boliden Ltd. v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co.</i>, 2008 ONCA
    418.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>That
    said, the amount claimed must also be fair and reasonable having regard to
    the nature of the appeal: see <i>Boucher v. Public Accounts Council for the
    Province of Ontario</i> (2004), 71 O.R. (3d) 291 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  We would fix the costs for the appellant, Dunn, in the amount of $35,000
    and for the appellant, Beatty, in the amount of $15,000.  Both amounts are<b> </b>inclusive
    of disbursements and G.S.T.  If an award is to be made in favour of Chubb,
    we would fix Chubb’s costs on a partial indemnity basis in the amount of
    $35,000, inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T.</p>
