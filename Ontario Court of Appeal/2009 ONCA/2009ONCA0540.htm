style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant, Garry Joseph Lalonde, appeals the January 25, 2008 judgment of
    Hennessy J. of the Superior Court of Justice in this matrimonial case, and
    her subsequent costs award in favour of the respondent, Karen April Lalonde.  In
    particular, he challenges the trial judge’s decision concerning: (i) spousal
    support; (ii) the validity of the property provisions of the agreement entered
    into by the parties; (iii) the award of joint custody of the sole child of
    the marriage, with the primary residence of the child being with the respondent
    wife; (iv) the trial judge’s failure to grant a divorce to the parties; (v)
    the trial judge’s award of a one-half interest in the equity in the former
    matrimonial home in favour of the respondent, without regard to the existing
    mortgage on the property; and (vi) costs.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    respondent does not resist the appellant’s position on the issues (iv) and
    (v).  We agree that the relief sought by the appellant on these two matters
    should be granted.  In particular, it appears that the trial judge mistakenly
    forgot to grant an order of divorce although it was sought by both parties
    and there was no suggestion that the legal grounds for a divorce order had
    not been satisfied.  Accordingly, the requested divorce order is hereby granted.  Further,
    paragraph 6 of the trial judgment is amended to provide that the respondent’s
    entitlement to one-half of the current appraised value of the former matrimonial
    home is subject to the prior payment by the parties of the principal and
    interest owing on the outstanding mortgage on the matrimonial home.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    see no merit to the balance of the appellant’s grounds of appeal for the
    following reasons.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    contrary to the appellant’s contention, there was some evidence before the
    trial judge regarding the respondent’s financial needs and income.  The respondent’s
    Financial Statement was filed at trial.    There was also evidence regarding
    the history of her accommodations and employment and the funds received by
    her from her boyfriend.  In these circumstances, as there was an evidential
    basis for her to do so, we are satisfied that the trial judge did not err
    in ordering spousal support.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    we do not agree that the trial judge erred by concluding that the appellant
    had repudiated the property provisions of the agreement entered into between
    the parties that the appellant sought to enforce.  That agreement contemplated
    that the respondent would be paid her share of the equity in the matrimonial
    home by one of two stipulated means of financing.  From the date of separation
    to the date of trial, the husband continued to occupy the matrimonial home
    without taking any steps to pay the respondent any part of her share of the
    equity in the home.  In these circumstances, regardless of the formalities
    attaching to the execution of the agreement in question, it was open to the
    trial judge to find that the appellant had repudiated the agreement and to
    decline to enforce it on that basis.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third,
    the trial judge’s decision concerning custody was amply supported by the
    evidential record, in particular, by the report of the Children’s Lawyer
    and the other evidence bearing on the best interests of the child of the
    marriage.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Fourth,
    in our view, there is no basis for the appellant’s claim of procedural unfairness.  The
    impugned rulings by the trial judge were discretionary decisions well within
    her jurisdiction.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    we see no error in the trial judge’s costs disposition in favour of the respondent.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appeal is therefore allowed in part to accord with the reasons set out above.  In
    all other respects, the appeal is dismissed.  The respondent is entitled
    to her costs of the appeal and of the proceedings in the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
