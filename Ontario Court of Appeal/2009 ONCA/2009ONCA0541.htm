  <h2>I.          Background</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    action arose from a serious fire that occurred in the early morning hours
    of November 20, 1999 on the appellants’
    farm property in eastern
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario.  As a result of the fire, a complex of barns and silos and a crop
    of about 4,000 tons of dry grain corn were destroyed or extensively damaged.  The
    fire was fought by volunteer firefighters from the respondent, the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">
    Township of
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Rideau (the “Township”), under the direction of the respondent, John Ingraham
    (“Ingraham”), and assisted by the respondent, George Hawkins (“Hawkins”).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    the fire, the appellants sued the Township, Ingraham and Hawkins in negligence,
    claiming damages for that part of the value of their damaged crop and other
    property that was underinsured.  Liability was the only issue at trial.  The
    parties agreed that the damages in question totalled $857,000, plus prejudgment
    interest.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    trial, the appellants alleged, among other matters, that the respondents – in
    particular Ingraham on his arrival at the fire site – failed to conduct an
    adequate assessment or “size-up” of the fire scene, with the result that
    the respondents failed to implement a fire attack plan that the appellants
    claimed could have prevented the spread of the fire to the feed room and
    connecting silos where the recently harvested corn crop was stored.  The
    trial judge agreed.  He held that the respondents breached “a professional
    standard” by failing to carry out an adequate size-up of the fire scene.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Nonetheless,
    despite this key finding, the trial judge held that the respondents, especially
    Ingraham, had exercised reasonable judgment in the “formulation and implementation” of
    the fire attack plan and that the plan itself was reasonable.  He further
    held that the appellants had failed to establish, to the requisite civil
    standard of proof, that the silos (and, hence, the corn crop) would have
    been saved had the fire attack plan recommended by the appellants been implemented.  The
    trial judge accepted the evidence of a defence causation expert that, in
    the prevailing circumstances, it was “inevitable” that the fire would have
    entered the feed room and then the silos, thereby reaching and destroying
    the corn crop.  As a result, in the trial judge’s opinion, causation was
    not established.  Accordingly, by judgment dated April 26, 2005, the trial
    judge dismissed the appellants’ action.  The appellants appeal the trial
    judge’s liability findings.  </p>
  <h2>II.        Issues</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants raise two issues.  First, they argue that the trial judge erred
    by finding that the respondents breached the applicable standard of care
    and also holding that the respondents’ conduct nonetheless was reasonable
    in the circumstances.  The appellants contend that these findings are contradictory
    and that, in effect, the trial judge wrongly purported to “save” the respondents’ breach
    by concluding that aspects of their conduct that flowed directly from that
    breach were reasonable.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants also submit that the trial judge erred in his causation analysis
    by accepting a defence “theory of inevitability” – that is, the thesis that
    the progression of the fire to the feed room and the silos was inevitable – when
    that theory, allegedly advanced for the first time at trial, rested on a
    factual foundation that was discredited at trial.    </p>
  <h2>III.       Discussion</h2>
  <h2>A.        Standard of Care</h2>
  <h2>(1)       Formulation of Standard of Care</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge expressed the standard of care applicable to volunteer firefighters
    in these terms:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In summary, consistent with established tort principles,
    the standard of care is one of reasonableness in the circum-stances.  This
    will include a consideration of the circum-stances of the fire, the relative
    availability of hydrants or alternative water supplies, the equipment available,
    the number of firefighters, their abilities, training and experience, and
    the many safety issues which arise at any scene.  Concisely put, the standard
    of care is the following:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote>The volunteer fire department must perform in
    a manner which is reasonable for a volunteer Fire Department in like circumstances
    and with like resources.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    parties do not challenge this formulation.  In these circumstances, without
    deciding whether the trial judge’s expression of the applicable standard
    of care was appropriate, we accept his articulation of that standard for
    the purpose of the determination of the issues raised on this appeal.</p>
  <h2>            (2)       Agreed Facts</h2>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    trial, the parties filed a Statement of Agreed Facts in which they agreed
    on the following, among other matters: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span

    about 1:00 a.m., the fire was firmly established in the feed room and was
    spreading rapidly along the feed room to the adjoining silos.  Given this
    progression of the fire, it was too late by then to extinguish the fire in
    the feed room.  This occurred within 12 to 15 minutes of the assumption by
    Ingraham of control of the fire scene (at 00:46:26 hours).  Accordingly,
    it was during this 15 minute period that the respondents’ actions were to
    be assessed (paras. 18, 19 and 44);</p>

    heavy black smoke coming from the two-storey barn and “some less dense smoke
    coming from the eaves of the feed room roof” (paras. 17, 24 and 25).  However,

    the trial judge’s findings and contrary to Ingraham’s belief, neither the
    feed room nor the adjoining silos was on fire when Ingraham assumed command
    of the fire ground, ordered the deployment of Pump 5, and carried out his
    size-up of the fire scene.  The trial judge held: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I find that Chief Ingraham was mistaken as to his
    observation concerning the silo being on fire at 00:47:33.  I conclude that
    the glow and the flame at the top of the silos at that point was a reflection

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I do not attribute any negligence to Chief Ingraham

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    core of the trial judge’s reasoning on the issue whether the respondents
    breached their duty of care is found in four paragraphs of his reasons.  At
    paragraph 38 he held: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[38]     <i>I find as a fact that Chief Ingraham
      did not consider the proposed approach [of the fire], because he did a
      very limited size-up and failed to appreciate the path that the advancing
      fire would likely take</i>.  The inspection of Lieutenant Horricks on the
      east and south of the burning calf barn and <i>Chief Ingraham’s own inspection
      of the northern perimeter and his southerly views along the line of silos
      from a position beside the northern most silo, were insufficient</i> to
      accurately assess the condition of the feed room and to identify the presence
      of access doors to the feed room between the northern three silos.  <i>He
      had ordered the deployment of his only (at that point) attack pumper, Pump
      5, before completing his size-up and before Adrian Schouten asked him to
      fight the fire from the south</i> and to channel water into the feed room.  <i>The
      result was that the option of flooding the south end of the feed room was
      not one that Chief Ingraham could pursue when Mr. Schouten proposed that
      approach.</i>  <i>I therefore find that the plaintiffs have proven, on
      a balance of probabilities, that the defendants breached a professional
      standard in failing to carry out an adequate size-up of the fire ground
      upon arrival, thereby prematurely committing their primary fire fighting
      vehicle (Pump 5) in an area that precluded its utilization in any attack
      on the fire (via the feed room) from the south of the fire ground</i>.  [Emphasis
      added.]</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Notwithstanding
    this finding of a breach of “a professional standard” by the respondents,
    the trial judge went on to hold that Ingraham’s deployment of his resources
    on site, his choice of a fire attack plan and the plan itself were reasonable
    in the circumstances:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[42]     In my view, the essential difference between
    Chief Ingraham’s fire attack plan and that suggested by Mr. Henderson [the
    appellants’ expert at trial on the standard of care] is one of differing
    priorities as to the choice of exposures requiring immediate protection.  These
    are judg-ment calls.  On the evidence, Chief Ingraham was not apprised of ‘relative
    values at risk’.  He was entitled to be concerned that a significant potential
    for fire extension existed from the high south-southwest winds blowing burning
    embers toward the two-story barn, the propane tank nearby and the Schouten
    home.  He was of the view that the fire had advanced into the feed room silo
    complex, which was not initially accurate, but was not unreasonable in all
    the circumstances.  He was also entitled to consider that deploying his primary
    pumper to the south of the fire, out of sight of his command post, in the
    silo fall zone and up wind of the fire, would be problematic.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[43]     One can well imagine what the plaintiffs’ outlook
    would have been if Pump 5 was deployed in an ultimately unsuccessful effort
    to block the fire advance from the south (via the feed room), while the Schouten
    home burned and the propane tank exploded (with potentially catastrophic
    results), before additional firefighting resources arrived.  With the benefit
    of hindsight, none of this occurred, but Chief Ingraham, in my view, had
    the right to fear these risks and to prioritize the deployment of his resources
    accordingly.  In doing so, he acted reasonably.  It would be an injustice
    to the defendants and contrary to the established principles of tort law
    to assess Chief Ingraham’s decisions from a retrospective armchair point
    of view when he was making these decisions in the face of a dangerous and
    fast moving fire.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[45]     I have found on the evidence that the defendants
    and in particular their incident commander, Chief Ingraham, exercised reasonable
    judgment in the formulation and implementation of the initial phases of the
    fire attack plan, being the period in issue.  In spite of an inadequate size-up
    and arguably premature deployment of his only attack pumper upon his arrival,
    he used reasonable judgment and adopted and competently executed a fire attack
    plan which I find to be reasonable for a volunteer Fire Department in like
    circumstances and with like resources.  </p>

    agree with the appellants that there is an inherent contradiction between
    the trial judge’s finding of a breach by the respondents, set out at paragraph
    38 of his reasons, and his subsequent findings that Ingraham’s actions on
    site and his chosen fire attack plan were “reasonable for a volunteer Fire
    Department in like circumstances and with like resources”.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the one hand, Ingraham’s chosen fire attack plan was based on his erroneous
    belief that there was fire in the feed room and in at least one of the silos
    at the relevant time.  That mistaken belief flowed from his failure to conduct
    an adequate size-up of the fire scene, a failure that the trial judge held
    was a breach of a core component of the standard of professional conduct
    applicable to the respondents.  The trial judge expressly held that Ingraham
    chose his fire attack plan based on his size-up of the fire scene, a size-up
    that the trial judge found was “very limited”, “insufficient” and inadequate.  Yet,
    on the other hand, the trial judge ‘forgave’
    this breach by holding that Ingraham’s mistaken belief in the state of the
    progression of the fire and his consequent actions were reasonable.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>These
    contradictory findings cannot stand together.  Having found a breach, the

    had not breached their duty of care to the appellants.</p>

    erroneous belief that the fire had spread to the area of the feed room and
    the silos and his decision to deploy Pump 5 at the northerly end of the site
    flowed directly from the breach found by the trial judge – the failure to
    conduct a proper size-up of the fire site.  To ‘salvage’ the respondents’
    breach on the basis advanced by the trial judge is tantamount to finding
    that the direct actions flowing from the breach were not negligent, although
    the root cause of those direct actions was itself negligent.</p>

    my view, although the trial judge’s description of the breach was couched
    in terms of the breach of a “professional standard”, read as a whole, paragraph
    38 of the trial judge’s reasons reveals a clear finding by him that the respondents
    breached the duty of care owed to the appellants.  Early in his reasons,
    the trial judge had found that the conduct of an adequate size-up on the
    fire site was an essential component of the fire fighting standard that applied
    to the respondents (para. 21).  He also found that the respondents breached
    their obligation to perform an adequate size-up.  </p>

    breach had a ‘domino’ effect.  On the findings of the trial judge, it was
    this breach that led to Ingraham’s erroneous belief that the fire had advanced
    to the feed room and at least one of the silos.  It was this breach that
    prevented Ingraham from gaining an appreciation of the path of the advancing
    fire.  It was this breach that resulted in the failure to identify the access
    doors to the feed room, later identified by

    did not say that if he had known that the fire was not where he thought it

    the opposite.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

    recognize that the evidence established that Ingraham was concerned on his
    arrival at the fire site with the safety implications of the existence of
    a propane tank and a residence in the face of a rapidly spreading fire.  Indeed,
    the risk of the propane tank exploding figured prominently in the trial judge’s
    reasoning in support of his conclusion that Ingraham’s actions on site –
    including his choice of a fire attack plan – were reasonable.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[28]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>But
    there was evidence at trial, to which the trial judge did not refer, that
    the propane tank was not in immediate danger from the fire and that it was
    capable of being moved.  In fact, at about 2:45 a.m. and at the request of
    the respondents,
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Adrian moved the propane tank away from the fire zone in about 10 to 15 minutes.  There
    is no suggestion that this could not have been accomplished earlier with
    the involvement of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Adrian and his equipment.  Nor does there appear to have been any evidence
    at trial that the attack plan recommended by the appellants was inappropriate
    or unrealistic because of the risk that the propane tank might explode at
    a location near the appellant’s residence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus,
    if a proper size-up of the fire scene had been conducted, Ingraham would
    have been fully informed of all the values to be protected on the fire site,
    as well as his options for prioritizing his available firefighting resources,
    including an attack plan that focussed on fighting the fire from a southerly
    location – near the feed room and the silos – to suppress the fire.  The
    failure to conduct a proper size-up foreclosed an informed evaluation of
    all the available options and fire attack plans.  </p>
  <h2>(5)       Conclusion Regarding </h2>
  <h2>                        Breach of the Duty of Care</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    all these circumstances, I conclude that the trial judge’s analysis of whether
    the respondents breached their duty of care to the appellants is fatally
    flawed.  Having found that the respondents’ conduct constituted a breach,
    the trial judge misdirected himself by then asking whether the results of
    that same conduct were reasonable and, hence, non-negligent.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Under
    the standard of care as defined by the trial judge and accepted by the parties,
    the question of the reasonableness of the respondents’ conduct was an integral
    part of the requisite inquiry as to whether the duty of care was breached.  It
    was reversible error for the trial judge to override his finding of a breach
    of the duty of care by subsequently concluding that the respondents’
    choice of a fire attack plan and the plan itself were reasonable and that
    Ingraham’s erroneous conclusion that the fire had not spread to the feed
    room and the silos was not unreasonable.  As I explain later in these reasons,
    this error necessitates a new trial. </p>
  <h2>B.        Causation</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Given
    my conclusion that the trial judge erred in his analysis of the respondents’ breach
    of the duty of care and that a new trial is therefore required, it is technically
    unnecessary to consider the appellants’ challenge to the trial judge’s causation
    inquiry.   However, as the issue was fully argued before this court, I will
    address it briefly.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants’ attack on the trial judge’s causation inquiry has two branches.  First,
    as I have indicated, they claim that it was not open to the trial judge to ‘save’ the
    respondents’ established breach of their duty of care by pointing to “misinformation
    and erroneous observations” that were the direct result of the breach.  Rather,
    he ought to have asked whether the breach caused the appellants’ loss.  In
    other words, the appellants submit that the trial judge failed to ask the
    proper causation question: but for the respondents’ breach, would the appellants’ loss
    have occurred?</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    the appellants contend that the trial judge further erred by accepting a “theory
    of inevitability” advanced by Richard Kooren (“Kooren”), the defence expert
    on causation.  At trial, Kooren offered the opinion that the fire was sufficiently
    advanced by the time of Ingraham’s arrival at the fire site that it would
    inevitably have spread to the feed room and the silos and, hence, to the
    corn crop.  Under this theory, any breach by the respondents of their duty
    of care was irrelevant.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    accepting Kooren’s testimony on this issue, the trial judge held that the
    appellants had not proven that the silos could have been saved by channelling
    water in the feed room.  In his view, it was unlikely that Pump 5, which
    he held was the only attack pumper available at the relevant time that was
    capable of the suggested manoeuvre, could have deployed to the south of the
    feed room before the fire was established at that location at approximately
    1:00 a.m.  The trial judge put it this way:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I prefer the evidence of the defendants’ expert,
    Mr. Kooren, who was of the view that in the circumstances it was unlikely,
    although not impossible, to control the fire from the feed room and thereby
    save the silos.  Mr. Kooren noted that the two barns, the feed room and silos,
    were essentially connected or adjacent structures, all wood framing with
    metal (tin) exteriors, and this large fire progressing through the structures
    would have been very difficult to stop.  <i>He was further of the view, which
    I accept, that once the two-storey barn had become fully involved, the fire
    would have inevitably entered the feed room (and then the silos) from the
    two-storey barn through the north east wall of the feed room</i>.  [Emphasis
    added.]  (para. 44).</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    the end of his reasons, the trial judge summarized his findings on causation
    in this fashion:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I have further found that the plaintiffs have failed
    to prove on the balance of probabilities that the silos would have been saved,
    had the plan recommended by the plaintiffs been implemented.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[37]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    make the following observations.  First, Kooren’s opinion that the spread
    of the fire to the feed room and the adjoining silos was inevitable was based
    on his assertion that the fire had reached the feed room and the silos at
    or shortly after the time that Ingraham arrived at the fire site.  In his
    report dated September 6, 2002, Kooren said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Mr. Schouten [
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Adrian] suggested that there was ample time to deploy equipment to protect
    the feed room.  However, at the time he talked to [Ingraham] it is known
    that the south silo was burning within 6 minutes of D.C. Ingraham’s arrival
    and only 8 minutes after the first apparatus was on scene.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[38]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    a second, supplementary report dated February 24, 2004, Kooren suggested
    that there was “overwhelming evidence from several sources” indicating that “in
    less than 10 minutes of the first pumps arriving on scene the fire had reached
    the silos”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[39]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>These
    assertions run contrary to the admitted facts and the trial judge’s findings,
    which established that:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Ingraham
    arrived at the fire site at 00:43:33 hours, and assumed command of the site
    about three minutes later, at 00:46:26 hours;</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    first firefighting vehicle at the fire site, Pump 5, arrived at 00:41:20
    hours; and </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>it
    was not until about 1:00 a.m. that the fire was firmly established in the
    feed room.  It then progressed from the feed room to the silos.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[40]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus,
    contrary to Kooren’s claims, the south silo was <i>not</i> burning within
    six minutes of Ingraham’s arrival (that is, at 00:49:33 hours) or within
    eight minutes after “the first apparatus” was on scene (that is, at 00:49:20
    hours).  Nor was there “overwhelming evidence”
    that the fire had reached the silos by 00:51:20 hours (that is, “in less
    than 10 minutes of the first pumps arriving on scene”).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[41]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    Kooren agreed on cross-examination at trial that if there was no heat, smoke
    or fire in the feed room at 00:45:00 hours, the deployment of a fire suppression
    vehicle to the rear of the feed room and the wetting down of the northerly
    and southerly ends of the feed room could have prevented fire from spreading
    to that location.  He also testified:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>Q.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>And,
    also if that had happened [the deployment of a fire vehicle for use in the
    vicinity of the feed room], it most likely would have prevented fire from
    spreading into the silos, do you not agree?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A.        Again, if they could control the fire
    from those areas it’s very likely that they could have prevented the fire
    from entering the silos.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[42]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    other words, on Kooren’s own evidence, if the fire had been attacked from
    the southerly end of the fire site before 1:00 a.m., in the vicinity of the
    feed room and the silos as Adrian had suggested to Ingraham, it was “very
    likely” that the silos and, hence, the corn crop, could have been saved from
    the fire.  Kooren was not re-examined at trial on this key evidence.  Nor
    did the trial judge allude to it in his reasons.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[43]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To
    the extent that the factual foundation for Kooren’s opinion about the inevitable
    spread of the fire was disproven at trial, the reliability of the defence “theory
    of inevitability” was cast into serious doubt.  Based on the trial judge’s
    reasons, I cannot be satisfied that he considered these important aspects
    of the evidence regarding the underpinnings of the defence theory of inevitability
    that he accepted.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    I agree with the appellants’ submission that the trial judge does not appear
    to have considered what Ingraham would have done to attack the fire had he
    learned from the conduct of a proper size-up that there was no fire in the
    feed room or silos when he assumed command of the fire site at 00:46:26 hours
    and decided to deploy Pump 5.  In particular, the trial judge makes no mention
    in his reasons of Ingraham’s trial testimony bearing on this issue, as in
    part above-quoted.  By failing to address this issue, the trial judge omitted
    a key component of the requisite causation analysis.</p>
  <h2>C.        Remedy</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants argue that if their appeal is successful, the appropriate relief
    in this case is an order setting aside the trial judgment and substituting
    in its stead an order granting judgment in their favour.  The appellants
    contend that given: (i) the nature of the standard of care articulated by
    the trial judge; (ii) the “findings” of breach made by the trial judge; and
    (iii) Kooren’s admissions on cross-examination regarding causation, detailed
    above, the remedy sought follows “logically”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my opinion, the trial judge’s findings concerning the respondents’ breach
    are contradictory and inconsistent.  It is not open to this court to resolve
    that conflict.  Rather, a new trial is required to do so.  Moreover, I have
    concluded that the causation analysis undertaken by the trial judge was materially
    incomplete.  The requirement for a complete causation analysis also compels
    a new trial.</p>
  <h2>IV.       Disposition</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>For
    the reasons given, I would allow the appeal, set aside the trial judgment
    and direct a new trial on liability.  I would award the appellants their
    costs of the appeal, fixed in the total amount of $30,000, inclusive of disbursements
    and GST.</p>

    hours (paras. 18, 22, 24 and 25).</p>
