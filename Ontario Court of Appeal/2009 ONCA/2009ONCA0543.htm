  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    seventeen years of marriage, Janice Cudjoe told her husband, Randulph, that
    she was leaving him for her new lover, Maryann Smith, whom she had met on
    the internet.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Shortly
    after Janice Cudjoe announced her intended departure from their marriage
    and home, Randulph Cudjoe stabbed both his wife and Maryann Smith in the
    chest with a kitchen knife.  Janice Cudjoe died.  Maryann Smith survived.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant admitted that he unlawfully killed his wife.  But, on his account,
    the appellant committed manslaughter, not second degree murder, the offence
    with which he was charged.  He denied intentionally stabbing Maryann Smith.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    their second day of deliberations, the jury found the appellant guilty of
    second degree murder in the death of his wife and of aggravated assault in
    the stabbing of Maryann Smith.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant says that both convictions are flawed because of legal errors in
    the reception of evidence of prior misconduct, in final instructions to the
    jury, and in the response given by the trial judge to a question asked by
    the jury during deliberations.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the reasons that follow, I would dismiss the appeal against convictions.  In
    oral argument, the appellant abandoned his appeal against sentence and I
    would dismiss that appeal as an abandoned appeal. </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant and Janice Cudjoe met in 1986 shortly after the appellant arrived
    in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    from the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    West Indies.  The couple married in 1988.  Their two children, aged 11 and
    12 at the time of trial, lived with them.  The appellant, who was 48 years
    old at the time of trial, worked as a landscaper.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Maryann
    Smith was 38 years at the time of the relevant events and had recently separated
    from her husband.</p>

    Cudjoe Meets Maryann Smith</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    early May 2004, Janice Cudjoe met Maryann Smith on an internet dating site.  Ms.
    Cudjoe was seeking out a new relationship on-line.  Shortly, the two women
    began to speak regularly by telephone and communicated frequently by email.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Janice
    Cudjoe and Maryann Smith first met in person at the Cudjoe home in early
    June 2004.  They began a sexual relationship.  At the time, the appellant
    thought that the two women were just friends.</p>
  <h3 style='page-break-after:avoid;
'>3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Ménage-à-Trois</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    few weeks after meeting Maryann Smith, Janice Cudjoe took the appellant to
    meet her new friend at Ms. Smith’s apartment.  The women had considered and
    discussed a three-way relationship, which was to include the appellant.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Shortly
    after the appellant had been introduced to Maryann Smith, the two women went
    into the bedroom.  At their invitation, the appellant entered the bedroom
    where he found his wife and Maryann Smith both lying naked on the bed. The
    appellant was “struck” by what he saw and asked his wife to explain what
    was going on.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    two women invited the appellant to join them on the bed and he did so.  The
    trio participated in sexual activity together.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>4.         The Appellant’s Request</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant asked his wife to end her relationship with Maryann Smith, but
      Janice Cudjoe declined to do so.  Janice Cudjoe insisted that the appellant
      give Maryann Smith a chance.  After all, the appellant had just met Ms.
      Smith.  The appellant agreed and continued to participate in sexual activities
      simultaneously with both women until mid-July 2004, about two weeks before
      Janice Cudjoe died.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      the meantime, Janice Cudjoe and Maryann Smith discussed the prospect of
      Janice Cudjoe leaving the appellant and taking up residence with Ms. Smith.
      The appellant was not privy to these discussions.  As far as he was concerned,
      the appellant believed that there were no problems in his marriage to Janice.</span></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>5.         The Assaults on Janice Cudjoe </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Over
      the objection of the appellant’s trial counsel, the trial judge admitted
      evidence from Maryann Smith about two assaults by the appellant on Janice
      Cudjoe within a month of the deceased’s death.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      first assault took place about one month before the appellant unlawfully
      killed his wife.  Janice Cudjoe and Maryann Smith were sitting on the bed
      in the bedroom of the Cudjoe home talking to each other.  The appellant
      came into the room and asked the two women what they were doing.  In an
      angry voice, the appellant accused the women of participating in sexual
      activity behind his back.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      appellant lay down on the bed between the two women. According to Maryann
      Smith, the appellant, without warning, punched his wife in the face.  Ms.
      Smith noticed no injuries to Janice Cudjoe’s face – no bruising or bleeding.</span></p>

      Smith recounted a second assault by the appellant on Janice Cudjoe that
      occurred about two weeks after the first incident and about two weeks before
      her death.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>During
      the course of an argument with the appellant at the Cudjoe residence, Maryann
      Smith announced that she was leaving “for good”.  Janice Cudjoe followed
      Ms. Smith to the driveway and pleaded with her not to leave.  The appellant
      came outside and yelled at Janice to let Maryann leave and to come back
      into the house with him.  Janice Cudjoe refused to go back inside.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>According
      to Maryann Smith, the appellant grabbed Janice by the back of her head,
      banged her head three times against the roof of the car, and pulled Janice
      by her arm towards the house. Ms. Smith returned later and spent the night
      at the Cudjoe residence comforting Janice.  </span></p>

      Smith did not notice any injuries to Ms. Cudjoe.  Like the first incident,
      Janice Cudjoe did not receive medical attention for any injuries suffered

      kill the deceased, or bore an animus towards the deceased.  Sometimes,
      the evidence adduced to demonstrate motive or animus involves other bad
      acts allegedly committed by the person charged.  To qualify for admission

      the evidence should not have been admitted. At all events, even if the

      claimed belief that the couple’s marriage was “good” and that Janice Cudjoe’s

      in combination, his intoxication and the provoking conduct of the deceased
      raised a reasonable doubt that he had either state of mind required to

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The fact that Randulph Cudjoe
      took the knife from the bedroom to the kitchen is equally consistent with

      an alleged absence of the required state of mind for murder as I shall
      define it for you.  With respect to this piece of evidence keep in mind
      that there is no evidence in this case that Randulph Cudjoe attempted to
      wash any blood off the knife or to conceal it from detection from the police
      in any way. Whether Randulph Cudjoe left it on the counter or the sink,
      it was still in plain view.  It is ultimately for you to assess the weight,
      if any, to place on this evidence, but it does not strike me that the fact
      that Randulph Cudjoe takes the knife from the bedroom to the kitchen is
      evidence which is of much assistance in supporting an inference one way

      that fact has no probative value and should play no role whatsoever in
      inferring the guilt of Randulph Cudjoe. Even if you were to find that Randulph
      Cudjoe was not being truthful in his evidence regarding his attempts to
      phone 911, the fact of his untruthfulness if you were to so find, could
      not be used to infer the guilt of Randulph Cudjoe or as affirmative evidence

      failed to assist was expressly removed from the determination of guilt

      judge told the jurors about the prohibited and permitted use of the evidence.
      Since the evidence was equally consistent with the appellant’s crime being
      manslaughter or second degree murder, the jurors were <i>not</i> entitled
      to use the evidence “to draw an inference of guilt towards Randulph Cudjoe”.  On
      the other hand, the jurors could use the evidence to rebut the appellant’s
      claim that he did not have the state of mind required to make his unlawful

      on intoxication and provocation as discrete “defences”.  Typically, the
      jurors learned that provocation (under s. 232 of the <i>Criminal Code</i>)
      entered their deliberations only <i>after</i> they had found that the appellant
      had committed murder.  Thus the trial judge removed provocation as a factor
      that the jurors could consider in deciding whether the prosecution had
      proven murder in the first place.  The appellant contends that provocation
      should have been included in the
    “rolled-up” instruction on intent.  </span></p>

      under s. 232, only available after murder has been proven and without influence

      decision on the state of mind issue.  The jurors were instructed that evidence
      of anger, instinctive reaction and excitement was relevant to their decision
      on the state of mind issue.  Provocation is not itself a state of mind.  Provocation,
      at bottom, consists of words and conduct by one person that produce a reaction
      in another. At its core, provocation involves a loss of self-control, due
      to anger or excitement. The jurors were instructed that both anger and
      excitement, as well as instinctive reaction, were relevant to the mental
      state required for murder.  The purpose of the “rolled-up” instruction
      is to ensure that the jury does not compartmentalize evidence and limit
      it to discrete defences, but rather considers its cumulative effect on
      the issue of the accused’s state of mind.  That purpose was achieved here.  </span></p>

    criminal law, a concession to human frailty based on a recognition that everyone,
    however law-abiding she or he may otherwise be, has her or his breaking point.  Provoked
    murder, s. 232 announces, is of such reduced culpability that it warrants

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[111]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN-US>The trial judge began his final instructions about proof of the state
      of mind required for murder by telling the jurors to take into account
      what the appellant did or did not do, how he did or did not do it, and

    attention to intoxication, a critical feature of the appellant’s defence.  At
    the end of his instructions on intoxication, to which no objection is taken,
    the trial judge made it clear that even if they rejected intoxication, the
    jurors were nonetheless required to consider the cumulative effect of evidence
    of:</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>i.          alcohol consumption;</span></p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>along with other evidence that the
      appellant:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>…acted instinctively, in the sudden

lang=EN-US>After a specific instruction about the role of anger in their decision

lang=EN-US>[114]<span

lang=EN-US>The trial judge did not use the term
    “provocation” in the “rolled-up” instruction.  But use of the term “provocation”,
    otherwise than in reference to the partial statutory defence, is not without
    its problems.  For example, in cases of planned and deliberate first degree
    murder provocation may be:</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>(i)        a statutory partial defence
      under s. 232, reducing murder to        manslaughter; and</span></p>

      on the issue on whether the murder was       deliberate.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span lang=EN-US>To avoid confusion, it has been suggested
      that the term “provocation”
    not be used in connection with item (ii), above, lest jurors apply the narrower
    meaning of the term when a broader and less exact scope is to be applied: <i>R.
    v. Mitchell</i>, [1965] S.C.R. 471, at p. 476.   The descriptive “provoking

lang=EN-US>To hold the instructions given here deficient because they omitted
      the single term “provocation” from the list of factors relevant to a determination
      of the appellant’s state of mind when he unlawfully killed his wife is
      to reject substance in favour of form.  The jury was instructed to take
      into account, among other things, anger, excitement, instinctive reaction
      and mental disturbance, all of which are closely allied with provocation.  The
      instructions given adequately equipped the jurors to perform the task set

lang=EN-US>The jury had a copy of the trial judge’s final instructions. Those
      instructions included reference to the prior relationship between the appellant
      and deceased, including “the same series of acts or insults”.  This relationship
      was linked to both the objective and subjective test for provocation.  The
      only circumstance the recharge excluded from consideration on the issue
      of the suddenness of the deceased’s wrongful acts or insults was her words
      or conduct that amounted to a predictable response to something the appellant
      said or did.</span></p>

      than repetitions of things said earlier the same evening, insults that
      produced no loss of self-control on anyone’s account of events.  While
      more of the same may sometimes be sudden, it seems scarcely the case here.  The
      failure to provide an express instruction to include a reference to the
      prior relationship, an instruction not sought by counsel at trial, did
      not cause the appellant any prejudice.</span></p>

      caused no prejudice in the circumstances of this case, the need for a clear,
      correct, careful and comprehensive response to all jury questions warrants
      emphasis.  Jury trials, especially the composition of jury instructions,
      are challenging work for all concerned.  It makes little sense to sacrifice
      accuracy and completeness for immediacy of response.  Questions from jurors
      that arise late in the evening, especially after a full day or longer of

      was entitled to have the trial judge apply his legal training to the evidence,
      to identify the essential features of the evidence relevant to the issue
      of the appellant’s intention and foresight, in short to his mental state,

lang=EN-US>For the respondent, Mr. Alvaro begs to differ.  Each case is different.
      Some require a more elaborate review and relation of evidence than others.
      This was an uncomplicated, for all practical purposes, single issue case.  The
      significant aspects of the evidence were reviewed by the trial judge in
      his final instructions.  The jury could not have been left in any doubt
      about how that evidence related to the issue they had to decide.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>Mr. Alvaro points out that the trial judge gave full and correct instructions
      about the mental or fault element required to be proven to make an unlawful
      killing murder.  His instructions on provocation were equally complete
      and correct.  In each instance, he listed or otherwise noted factors that
      the jurors could consider in reaching their conclusion.  The relevance
      of the evidence to these elements was obvious, the evidence itself remarkable
      for its simplicity.  All that was reviewed was the evidence that mattered.  </span></p>

      and textured relation of the evidence would have worked great mischief
      for the appellant. The evidence of intoxication was flimsy at best, belied
      by the appellant’s own words.  Likewise, the evidentiary underpinnings
      for the loss of self-control.  No prejudicial error here.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>The obligation upon a trial judge to <i>review</i> the essential parts
      of the evidence and to <i>relate</i> it to the critical issues in the case
      so that the jurors will appreciate its value and effect is well-established.
      The <i>locus classicus </i>of the principle is its expression by Taschereau
      J. in <i>Azoulay</i> <i>v. The Queen</i>, [1952] 2 S.C.R. 495, at pp. 497-498: </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>The rule which has been laid down,
      and consistently followed is that in a jury trial the presiding judge must,
      except in rare cases where it would be needless to do so, review the substantial
      parts of the evidence, and give the jury the theory of the defence, so
      that they may appreciate the value and effect of that evidence, and how
      the law is to be applied to the facts as they find them.  As Kellock J.A.
      (as he then was) said in <i>Rex v. Stephen</i> <i>et al.</i>: “It is not
      sufficient that the whole evidence be left to the jury <i>in bulk for valuation</i>.” The
      pivotal questions upon which the defence stands must be clearly presented
      to the jury’s mind. Of course, it is not necessary that the trial judge
      should review all the facts, and that his charge be a minute record of
      the evidence adduced… [Emphasis in original; citations and footnotes omitted.]</span></p>

lang=EN-US>The jury received legally accurate instructions about the essential
      elements of murder.  They were given the appropriate benchmarks by which
      they could determine whether the mental element required to make an unlawful
      killing murder had been established.  Likewise, the instructions parsed
      the constituents of the partial defence of provocation and explained the
      consequences of a reasonable doubt on the issue.  The evidence upon which
      they could rely on both issues was uncomplicated, essentially the testimony
      of two witnesses, the appellant and Maryann Smith, together with the testimony
      of investigating officers about their observations at the scene and minimal
      uncontroversial expert opinion evidence.  Counsel had reviewed the same
      evidence in support of their positions on the preceding day.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>In this case, this ground of appeal fails for several reasons. At
      the risk of repetition, this was a single issue case: was it murder or
      was it manslaughter.  The evidence was neither lengthy nor complicated.
      Expert evidence was minimal and uncontroversial.  The relationship between
      the evidence reviewed by the trial judge and the issue to be decided would
      be obvious to a contemporary Canadian jury.  The evidentiary review, which
      followed very shortly after the legal instructions, was focused on the
      critical features of the evidence, not cluttered or rendered meaningless
      by a lengthy and indiscriminate regurgitation of  nearly everything said
      by almost everybody who testified.  Counsel at trial did not object to
      either the substance or placement of the evidentiary review and voiced
      no complaint that the manner in which it was done failed to alert the jury
      to the value and effect of the evidence on the issues to be decided.</span></p>

      is <i>not</i> co-extensive with a simple review, summary or even a complete
      rendition of the evidence adduced at trial.  Such rote reviews are more
      apt to confuse than to enlighten, especially when jurors are numbed into
      near automatistic states by a mindless recitation of evidentiary <i>minutiae</i>.  The
      mere fact that an item of evidence has been introduced at a trial does

    systematic approach to jury instructions.  A crucial constituent of this
    scheme, reflected in item iv, above, involves linking the critical features
    of the evidence to the issue or essential element to which the evidence relates.  Said
    somewhat differently, what must be proven (the essential element) is mated

lang=EN-US>To determine whether an essential element of an offence has been proven
      beyond a reasonable doubt requires a jury to make findings of fact.  These
      findings of fact are made on the basis of evidence adduced at trial: testimony,
      exhibits and admissions, together with inferences drawn from that evidence.  For
      each finding of fact some, but usually not all of the evidence adduced
      at trial will be relevant. The trial judge’s task is to review the essentials
      of that evidence and to relate it to the issue to which it is relevant.  A
      legal instruction combined with a contemporaneous review of the evidence
      on the issue seems more likely to assist the jurors in their decision-making
      than an instruction that segregates what must be proven from what is used
      to prove it.</span></p>
