    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    College of
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Physicians and Surgeons (the College) has reasonable and probable grounds
    to believe that the appellant physicians have committed an act of professional
    misconduct or are incompetent.  The Registrar has therefore appointed investigators,
    including a physician investigator, to conduct an inquiry into the practice
    of the appellants.  The Registrar’s particular concern is invasive and high-risk
    cosmetic surgery performed by the appellants who are general practitioners
    and, it is alleged, have no special training in surgery.  The College has
    asked that the appellants submit to an interview and to observation of their
    surgical practice.  The appellants initially refused to comply with both
    requests.  They now only contest the request that the inspectors observe
    their surgical practice.  They submit that the governing legislation does
    not authorize such an investigation.  The
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court disagreed and dismissed the appellants’ application for
    judicial review.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      For
    the following reasons, I would dismiss these appeals from the decision of
    the
    <st1:Street

    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court.  Largely for the reasons given by the

    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court, the examination that the College seeks to undertake is
    authorized by the governing legislation.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE FACTS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      This
    case turns on the interpretation of the governing legislation, the <i>Health
    Professions Procedural Code</i> (the Code), being Schedule 2 of the <i>Regulated
    Health Professions Act, 1991, </i>S.0. 1991, c. 18 (the Act).  Accordingly,
    only a brief description of the facts is required.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Dr.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Judah</st1:country-region>
    </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      Dr.
    Eli Judah has not completed a formal surgical residency or certification
    process.  Nevertheless, since 1999, he has exclusively practised cosmetic
    surgery.  In December 2006, one of his patients died two days after surgery.  In
    April 2007, the College received a letter from the Office of the Chief Coroner
    advising that as a result of his investigation, he suspected that there might
    be an issue around the quality of care provided to the patient by Dr.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Judah</st1:country-region>
    .  In June 2007, the Registrar formed a belief, based on reasonable and probable
    grounds, that the appellant had committed an act of professional misconduct
    or was incompetent.  With the approval of the College’s Executive Committee,
    the Registrar appointed investigators under s. 75(a) of the Code.  The investigators,
    including a physician investigator, have obtained charts from the appellant’s
    clinic.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    College informed the appellant that the Registrar’s investigation would include
    an observation component to be undertaken by the physician investigator and
    another investigator.  The appellant took the position that the College had
    no power to require him to cooperate with this request and he refused to
    comply.  In March 2008, the College issued a summons pursuant to s. 76(1)
    of the Code directing the appellant to attend for questioning by the appointed
    investigators.  The appellant also initially refused to comply with this
    direction.  The appellant is no longer refusing to comply with the summons.
    The only issue before this court is the request that the inspectors observe
    the appellant as he performs cosmetic surgery.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Dr. Jain and Dr. Gore</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      Dr.
    Padma Jain and Dr. Stanley Gore face the same investigative process as Dr.&nbsp;
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Judah</st1:country-region>
    .  However, the path that led to the request that inspectors observe their
    practice is different.  In April 2007, the College’s governing body, the
    Council, directed staff to take measures to address the proliferation of
    cosmetic procedures being performed in numerous facilities by numerous physicians.  One
    of these measures involved the mailing of a document titled “Mandatory Questionnaire
    for Physicians Performing Cosmetic Procedures” to approximately 600 physicians.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      The
    Questionnaires completed by Drs. Jain and Gore indicated that their practices
    are entirely devoted to cosmetic surgery of various types.  Some of these
    procedures are considered to be invasive and high risk.  Both Dr. Jain and
    Dr. Gore are general practitioners and have not undergone a formal surgical
    residency or certification process.  As a result of the analysis of the Questionnaire,
    the Registrar believes, on reasonable and probable grounds, that both doctors
    have committed an act of professional misconduct or are incompetent.  With
    the approval of the Executive Committee, the Registrar appointed investigators
    under s. 75(a).  In the course of investigating Drs. Jain and Gore, the College
    removed a selection of patient charts for review by the physician investigator.  The
    College also sought to have the investigators observe both doctors while
    they performed cosmetic surgery.  Both Dr. Jain and Dr. Gore have refused
    to comply with that request.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE LEGISLATION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>      This
    case concerns the powers of investigation of investigators appointed under
    s.&nbsp;75 of the Code.  Those powers are contained in s.&nbsp;76 of the
    Code and Part II of the <i>Public Inquiries Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. P.41.  Those
    provisions are as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i><u>Health Professions Procedural Code</u></i><u>:</u></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>76<b>.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;An investigator
    may inquire into and examine the practice of the member to be investigated
    and has, for the purposes of the investigation, all the powers of a commission
    under Part II of the <i>Public Inquiries Act</i>. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1.1)&nbsp;&nbsp;An investigator may make reasonable
    inquiries of any person, including the member who is the subject of the investigation,
    on matters relevant to the investigation. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;An investigator may, on the production
    of his or her appointment, enter at any reasonable time the place of practice
    of the member and may examine anything found there that is relevant to the
    investigation. </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;No person shall obstruct an investigator
    or withhold or conceal from him or her or destroy anything that is relevant
    to the investigation. </p>

    appellants also rely upon other provisions of the Code that they say assist
    in the interpretation of s. 76.  In particular they rely upon provisions
    that establish the Quality Assurance Program and a newly enacted regulation-making
    power.  Those provisions are as follows:</p>

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE REASONS OF THE DIVISIONAL COURT</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    were several issues before the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court. However, before this court, the parties only contest whether
    an investigator, appointed under s. 75 of the Code, has the power to compel
    observation of a member performing cosmetic surgery.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Divisional Court held that the power of the investigators to observe the
    appellants as they performed surgery is found in s. 76(1), and in particular,
    in the phrase, “inquire into and examine the practice of the member to be
    investigated”.  The court held that the ordinary meaning of these words encompasses
    observation of surgical procedures.  Recognizing that under the modern rules
    of statutory interpretation it is not sufficient to consider the ordinary
    meaning of terms in legislation, the court went on to consider the purpose
    of the legislation and the relevant provisions in the legislative context.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    court noted that the primary purpose of the legislation is the protection
    of the public and that the College as a self-regulatory body has a statutory
    duty to serve and protect the public interest.  The court was satisfied that
    observation of a member’s treatment of patients was reasonably within that
    purpose, where concerns had been raised about the member’s competence.  As
    the court said at para. 40:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In the context of medical practice, an inquiry
    into and examination of a member's practice reasonably includes observation
    of the member's treatment of patients in circumstances where there is a concern
    about the member's competence that requires observation of the member. Observation
    is particularly important in the case of surgery, where the practice is predominantly
    a manual one. As the affidavit evidence filed on behalf of the College indicates,
    the observation of surgical practice is an important tool to assess a physician's
    skill and competence, as well as his or her ability to deal with complications.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    court also found support for this interpretation of s. 76(1) in s. 76(3),
    which requires that no person shall obstruct an investigator.  As the court
    said at para. 44:  “Refusal to permit an observation of clinical practice,
    in a case where the College has reasonable concerns about the member's conduct
    and competence, would, in our view, constitute obstruction of the investigator.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court also looked at the provisions in the Code that establish
    the Quality Assurance Program.  It was the appellants’ position that the
    College was attempting to subject members to an assessment of their practice
    and competence while denying members the protection from having the results
    used for matters beyond assessment. In particular, the court considered ss.
    82 and 83. Those provisions not only impose a positive duty on the member
    to co-operate with the College and its investigators but also protect the
    member because the results of the assessment are not admissible in a subsequent
    proceeding for misconduct or incompetence.  The court pointed out, however,
    that the purposes of an assessment and an investigation are different and
    it was not surprising that the provisions would be different.  As the court
    said at paras. 48 and 49:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;The College randomly selects
      hundreds of physicians each year for quality assessment of clinical practice.
      The primary aim is both evaluation and education. Therefore, physician
      co-operation with the process is necessary to achieve the aims of the program.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>&nbsp;In contrast, an investigation
      under s. 75(a) only occurs if information has been brought to the attention
      of the Registrar that gives him reasonable and probable grounds to believe
      that the member has committed an act of professional misconduct or is incompetent.
      The investigator appointed under s. 75(a) has wide-ranging powers to inquire
      into and examine the member's practice. Those powers are framed in broad
      and general terms in order to cover a wide range of circumstances.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the court considered the physicians’ argument that where a provision is ambiguous,
    it should be interpreted in the light of values enshrined in the <i>Canadian
    Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i>.  However, since the court found that
    the provisions of the Code<i> </i>were not ambiguous, it was not necessary
    to consider that argument.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I have indicated, I agree entirely with the reasons of the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court. The following comments are intended to address the recent
    amendments to the Code and the submission of the appellants that the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court failed to fully consider the entire legislative context,
    and failed to give sufficient weight to the privacy interests of the members’ patients.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants do not dispute that the ordinary dictionary meaning of the term “inquire
    into and examine the practice of the member to be investigated” are broad
    enough to encompass observation of the members as they perform the various
    procedures that make up their practice.  The principal submission of the
    appellants is that the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court erred in failing to consider the phrase in the legislative
    context.  In considering this submission I start, as did the Divisional Court,
    with the core principle of self-regulation set out by the Supreme Court of
    Canada in <i>Pharmascience Inc. v. Binet</i>, [2006] 2 S.C.R. 513.  Speaking
    for the majority, LeBel J. emphasized the onerous obligation placed on self-regulating
    bodies to protect the public.  It follows that those given this obligation
    have the duty to inquire into the conduct of the members and
    “will have sufficiently effective means at their disposal to gather all information
    relevant to determining whether a complaint should be lodged”: at para. 37.  In
    view of this principle, it would take clear words to deprive the investigator
    of powers necessary to carry out this important public interest.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    this principle in mind I turn to the appellants’
    submissions.  First, the appellants submit that the phrase “inquire into
    and examine” as found in s. 76(1) must be interpreted by taking into account
    the entire subsection and in particular the concluding words.  For convenience,
    I repeat s. 76(1):</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>An investigator may inquire into and examine the
    practice of the member to be investigated and has, for the purposes of the
    investigation, all the powers of a commission under Part II of the <i>Public
    Inquiries Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants submit that the powers of inquiry and examination must be those
    that are capable of being enforced under Part II of the <i>Public Inquiries
    Act</i> and must be limited to those powers alone.  Since there is no power
    under the <i>Public Inquiries Act</i> to compel a physician to perform surgery
    under observation, it follows that “inquire and examine” cannot include compelled
    observation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not accept that submission.  The powers given to the investigators under
    the <i>Public Inquiries Act</i> are not the only powers of enforcement under
    the Code.  Subsection (1) must be read along with the other provisions of
    s. 76 and in particular subsection (3), which prohibits anyone from obstructing
    an investigator. While not before the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court, I note that the newly enacted subsection (3.1), which requires
    the member to co-operate fully with an investigator, is an enforcement power
    that supports a broad interpretation of “inquire and examine”.  These provisions
    are in addition to the more cumbersome procedure under the <i>Public Inquiries
    Act.</i>  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants also submit that the Divisional Court erred in failing to consider
    the impact of subsection (2), which provides that the investigator may, “on
    the production of his or her appointment, enter at any reasonable time the
    place of practice of the member and may examine anything found there that
    is relevant to the investigation”.  The appellants submit that the Legislature,
    having expressly provided for a limited right of examination of any “thing” in
    the place of practice, could not have contemplated that there would be an
    additional power to observe the member perform surgery at the place of practice.  In
    other words, had it intended to permit the investigator to enter and observe
    the member performing surgery, the Legislature would have said so expressly.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Again,
    I cannot accept this narrow interpretation of the legislative scheme.  Subsection
    (2) contains two distinct powers, the power to enter and the power to examine
    things.  The power to enter is not limited to entry for the purpose of examining
    things.  Having gained lawful entry, it would be open to the investigator
    to exercise any of the other powers conferred by s.76.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants also submit that a further indication that compelled observation
    was not contemplated by s. 76(1) is that no provision is made for protection
    of the privacy of the patient under observation.  However, other provisions
    of the Code already contemplate significant intrusion into patient privacy
    and confidentiality in the interests of conducting a proper investigation.  For
    example, s. 76 itself provides, in subsection (4), that the section applies
    despite any provision in any Act relating to the confidentiality of health
    records.  Investigations by self-regulating bodies inevitably involve some
    intrusion into the confidentiality of the relationship between the member
    and the client or patient.  An investigation under s. 76 will have to take
    into account the patients’ interests and the section does not purport to
    override those interests, except with respect to health records as articulated
    in subsection (4). The provisions of the Act that compel the member to co-operate
    with the investigator do not impose a similar obligation on the patient.  It
    seems apparent that observation of a surgical procedure will have to be conducted
    in a manner that protects the patients’
    privacy interests.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    both the Act and the Code contain explicit provisions to prevent public disclosure
    of confidential patient information.  For example, College employees and
    agents are required, with limited specific exceptions, to keep confidential
    all information that comes to their knowledge in the course of their duties.  I
    also find compelling the observations of McLachlin J.A. in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceType w:st="on">
    <i>College</i><i> of
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Physicians</i><i> and Surgeons of B.C. v. Bishop</i> (1989), 56 D.L.R. (4th)
    164 (B.C.S.C.),  at p. 171, that
    “while the public has an expectation that medical records will be kept confidential,
    that expectation is subject to the higher need to maintain appropriate standards
    in the profession”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants’ next submission on the legislative context concerns the impact
    of Quality Assurance provisions on the interpretation of s. 76.  Those provisions
    provide the College with the authority to require members to confer with
    their assessors and participate in programs to evaluate their knowledge,
    skill and judgment.  As counsel for the appellant
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Judah</st1:country-region>
    put it in their factum, the provisions “expressly empower the College to
    conduct a general assessment of a physician, which the College is attempting
    to accomplish under the section 75 investigation”. They submit that if the
    Legislature had intended to compel compliance under s. 75, it would have
    expressly indicated that intention as it did with respect to the Quality
    Assurance Program. This submission had more force prior to the recent addition
    of subsection (3.1) to s. 76, which now expressly requires the member to
    “co-operate fully” with an investigator.  Whatever the situation before this
    amendment, it is now apparent that the s. 75 investigators have ample powers
    to ensure that they are able to inquire into and examine the practice of
    the member.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants also rely upon the fact that there is no protection against self-incrimination
    in s. 76, comparable to the protections found in ss. 83 and 83.1.  The effect
    of those provisions is that quality assurance information is not admissible
    in any proceeding.  However, as the
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court pointed out, an investigation under s. 75 and the Quality
    Assurance Programs have very different objectives.  The most important distinction
    is that quality assurance involves assessment of hundreds of physicians who
    are randomly selected to be assessed.  The point of the program is quality
    assurance.  In contrast, an investigation under s. 75 is not random, but
    initiated on the basis of reasonable and probable grounds that the member
    may have committed an act of professional misconduct or is incompetent.  The
    whole purpose of the investigation is to gather evidence.  That evidence
    may show that the allegations are groundless or that discipline proceedings
    are required.  Nothing in s. 76 extends protection to the member in respect
    of the evidence gathered through other investigative methods, for example,
    evidence obtained through examination of patients’ records. That said, it
    will be for the bodies dealing with subsequent proceedings to determine the
    admissibility of any evidence gathered during the investigative phase.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    as the College points out, the Quality Assurance Program is not as benign
    as the appellants assert.  For example, under s. 80.2, the Quality Assurance
    Committee may direct the Registrar to impose terms, conditions or limitations
    on the certificate of registration of a member for a specified period to
    be determined by the Committee.  And, under s. 83(3), if, as a result of
    an assessment, the Committee is of the opinion that a member may have committed
    an act of professional misconduct or may be incompetent, the Committee may
    disclose the name of the member and allegations against the member to the
    Executive Committee.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    final legislative provision relied upon by the appellants is the newly enacted
    s.&nbsp;95(1)(h.1), which allows the Council, subject to the approval of
    the Lieutenant Governor in Council, to make regulations</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER style='line-height:normal;'> [P]roviding for the direct
    observation of a member in his or her practice, including the direct observation
    by inspectors of procedures, during the course of an inspection or examination
    provided for under clause (h).  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>Clause (h) refers to regulations requiring and providing
    for <i>inter alia </i>the “inspection and examination of premises used in
    connection with the practice of the profession and of equipment, books, accounts,
    reports and records of members”.  The appellants point to clause (h.1) as
    proof that when the Legislature intended to permit direct observation of
    the member, it did so expressly.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    am not convinced that this regulation-making power, designed to facilitate
    direct observation during inspections, should be used to limit the broad
    scope of the investigative power under s. 76.  Such an interpretation would
    be inconsistent with the principle from <i>Pharmascience</i>, that requires
    that investigative powers be interpreted in a manner that ensures that the
    investigators will have sufficiently effective means at their disposal to
    gather all information relevant to determining whether a complaint should
    be lodged.  Particularly when considering allegations of misconduct or incompetence
    in relation to surgery, the optimal means of gathering relevant information
    is through direct observation.  I can see no principled basis for distorting
    the ordinary meaning of “inquire into and examine the practice” to exclude
    the means of investigation that in some circumstances are most likely to
    uncover the truth and therefore best protect the public.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants also submit that s. 76 should be interpreted in light of <i>Charter</i> values
    including protection of patient privacy and protection against self-incrimination.  The
    appellants concede that resort to <i>Charter</i> values is only necessary
    where the provision is ambiguous.  Like the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address

    Divisional Court, I find no ambiguity in s. 76, at least in respect of compelled
    observation of physicians undertaking cosmetic surgery.  Accordingly, it
