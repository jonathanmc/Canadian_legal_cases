  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Bell and The Plan Group entered into an Alliance Agreement on February 1,
    1999, concerning joint projects for the delivery of services to customers
    on cabling projects in the Greater
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto Region.  The Agreement contained a two-step dispute resolution process,
    found in section 22.  The parties were first to engage in good faith discussions
    using “their commercially reasonable efforts to settle the dispute” (s. 22.1).  Thereafter,
    if those discussions failed, the parties were to resort to arbitration (s.
    22.2). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Section
    22.2, the arbitration clause – the interpretation of which is at the heart
    of this appeal – reads as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Bell and [The Plan Group] will settle by arbitration
    any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement or any Sub-contract
    that is not finally resolved pursuant to Section 21.1 hereof.<a href="#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  <i>A single arbitrator will conduct the arbitration
    under the Arbitration Act, 1991 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario) and the then-current rules of the Arbitration and Mediation Institute
    of Ontario Inc.</i> 
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Bell and [The Plan Group] will select the arbitrator from a panel of persons
    knowledgeable in business information and the construction industry.  The
    decision and award of the arbitrator will be final and binding and the award
    so rendered may be entered into any court having jurisdiction thereof.  The
    arbitration will be held in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario.  The arbitrator will not be empowered to award punitive damages
    to either Party.  <i>Failure to file a notice of arbitration within twelve
    (12) months after the occurrences supporting a claim constitutes an irrevocable
    waiver of that claim.</i> [Emphasis added.]<a href="#_ftn2" name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second sentence of the arbitration clause (which I shall refer to as “the
    conduct of arbitration provision”) stipulates that the arbitration will be
    conducted under the <i>Arbitration Act, 1991</i>, S.O. 1991, c. 17, “and
    the then-current rules” of the Institute.  In this regard there are two sets
    of rules that were considered by the application judge – those that were
    in effect at the time the Agreement was negotiated (the “1999 Rules”), and
    those that were in effect at the time the dispute arose between the parties
    (the “Current Rules”).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    2005, a dispute arose between
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Bell and The Plan Group in relation to certain work performed under the Agreement
    for the Greater Toronto Airport Authority.  Invoices exceeding $40 million
    in value were at the heart of the dispute.  The differences could not be
    resolved through
    “commercially reasonable efforts to settle.”  Accordingly, on August 26,
    2005, The Plan Group delivered to Bell a draft notice demanding arbitration.  On
    December 14, 2005 it delivered a final notice demanding arbitration.  No
    notice to arbitrate the dispute was – nor has one ever been – filed with
    the Institute, however.  The last sentence of the arbitration clause (which
    I will refer to as the “waiver provision”) specifies that a failure to file
    a notice of arbitration in time will constitute an irrevocable waiver of
    the claim.   </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>II.        THE POSITIONS OF THE PARTIES </span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Bell has repeatedly taken the position that, in order to commence the arbitration,
    The Plan Group must deliver to
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Bell and file with the Institute, a written notice of request to arbitrate.  This
    position is based upon section 22.2 of the Agreement, and the requirements
    of Articles 11 and 13 of the Current Rules.  Article 11 provides for the
    submission of disputes under agreements to arbitration “by delivering a written
    Notice of Request to Arbitrate to the respondent”.  Article 13 specifies
    that, “The arbitration <i>is deemed to have commenced</i> when a Notice of
    Request to Arbitrate … <i>has been filed</i> <i>with the Institute</i> and
    the initial filing fee has been paid” (emphasis added). 
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Bell also relies on Article 5, which says that, “By agreeing to the Rules,
    the parties agree that the arbitration shall be administered by the Institute”,
    and the stipulation in Article 3 that, “To the extent that the Rules conflict
    with the Act, the provisions of the Rules shall apply”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Plan Group contends, on the other hand, that no notice of arbitration need
    be filed with the Institute for the arbitration to be commenced.  It submits
    that none of the Rules of the Institute apply to govern the initiation or
    commencement of the arbitration and that the Rules are only engaged after
    the arbitrator has been chosen and only to the extent that the Institute’s
    rules pertain to the procedural conduct of the arbitration.  The arbitration
    may be commenced in any way permissible under the Act, The Plan Group argues,
    and it has complied with section 23(1)3 of the Act by delivering provisional
    and final notices demanding arbitration upon Bell. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Underlying
    all of these arguments is the real issue between the parties.  It is
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Bell’s position that as a result of The Plan Group’s failure to file a notice
    of arbitration with the Institute, its complaints are time barred by virtue
    of the closing sentence of Section 22.2 cited above.  For reasons that are
    not entirely clear on the record, this issue has not been addressed directly.  Instead,
    it has been equated by the parties – and by the application judge – with
    the issue of how the arbitration is to be commenced.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>III.       LAW AND ANALYSIS</span></h4>
  <h3>Interlocutory/Final Order</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Plan Group argues that the judgment below is interlocutory in nature and,
    therefore, that
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Bell requires leave to appeal, which it has not sought.  I disagree.  The
    decision is a final order because it finally determined the only issue raised
    in the application before the application judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Plan Group’s theory is that the practical and legal result of the decision
    is to confirm that an arbitration proceeding has already been commenced,
    given the declaration that the filing of a notice of arbitration was not
    necessary to commence the arbitration.  The decision was therefore an intervention
    by the court to assist in the conduct of the arbitration in order to ensure
    that the arbitration was being conducted in accordance with the arbitration
    clause in the Agreement, as contemplated by s. 6 of the <i>Arbitration Act,
    1991</i>.  So far as is relevant, s. 6 provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>Court intervention limited</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>6.  No court shall intervene in matters governed
    by this Act, except for the following purposes, in accordance with this Act:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>1.  To assist the conducting of arbitrations.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>2.  To ensure that arbitrations are conducted in
    accordance with arbitration agreements.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Plan Group accordingly submits that the decision below was simply interlocutory
    in nature, within the context of an ongoing arbitration proceeding; it did
    not finally determine any substantive matter in the arbitration.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is no merit in this argument.  It misconceives the nature and purpose of
    the interlocutory/final order dichotomy, which is to act as a gatekeeper
    for appeals to a higher court in the particular proceeding before the courts.  An
    application, like an action, is a free-standing proceeding.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    classic explanation of whether an order is final or interlocutory is that
    of Middleton J.A. in <i>Hendrickson v. Kallio</i>, [1932] O.R. 675 (C.A.),
    at p. 678:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The interlocutory order from which there is no
    appeal is an order which does not determine the real matter in dispute between
    the parties – the very subject matter of the litigation, but only some matter
    collateral.  It may be final in the sense that it determines the very question
    raised by the application,<a href="#_ftn3" name="_ftnref3"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[3]</span></span></span></a> but it is interlocutory if the merits <i>of the
    case</i> remain to be determined.  [Emphasis added.]  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Here,
    the merits <i>of the case</i> – i.e., of the application proceeding before
    the court – have been determined.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the decision of this Court in <i>Buck Bros. Ltd. v. Frontenac Builders
    Ltd.</i> (1994), 19 O.R. (3d) 97 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), is determinative of this issue.  There, Morden A.C.J.O. made it quite

    an order of a judge is final or interlocutory.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Buck
      Bros.</i>, the application judge ordered that whether a condition precedent
      for arbitration had been met should be determined, not by the court, but
      by a panel of arbitrators appointed in accordance with the arbitration
      agreement.  An appeal was launched, but the responding party moved to have
      the appeal quashed.  The argument was that the order under appeal was interlocutory,
      because the real subject-matter of the litigation between the parties was
      still to be determined on the merits in the arbitration, and therefore
      the appeal was not properly before the court. </p>

    A.C.J.O rejected this argument.  At p. 100, after citing the passage from <i>Hendrickson
    v. Kallio</i> set out above,<i> </i>he said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>In one sense, it can be said that the order in
    question does not determine “the real matter in dispute between the parties” (which
    is the right of the moving parties to be paid fair and equitable consideration
    by the responding parties and, if so, its amount, or, something less than
    this, whether the condition precedent to commencing an arbitration proceeding
    has been met).  I do not think, however, that, in the circumstances, the
    order is interlocutory.  I read the passage from <i>Hendrickson v. Kallio</i> as
    referring to “the real matter in dispute between the parties” <i>in the proceeding
    which is before the court</i> and not in some other proceeding which may,
    or may not, then be in existence.  In accordance with this interpretation,
    I read “the litigation” in “the very subject matter of the litigation” as
    referring to the proceeding in which the order in question is made.  Similarly,
    I read “the case” in “if the merits of the case remain to be determined” as
    also referring to the proceeding in which the order is made.  [Emphasis in

    the proposed appeal was from an order dismissing a motion for a stay of the

    generally agree with Steel J.A.’s summary, except for her categorical statement – purportedly
    reflecting <i>Housen</i> – suggesting that questions of mixed fact and law
    always attract the palpable and overriding error standard.  In my view, <i>Housen</i> does
    not stand for such a definitive statement, nor does the jurisprudence in
    this Court.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    must be remembered, particularly when considering the appropriate standard
    of review for questions of mixed fact and law, that the Court in <i>Housen</i> did
    not tackle that subject in the context of contractual interpretation.  It
    did so <i>clearly and explicitly</i> in the context of a negligence action,
    an entirely different brand of case.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style='color:black'>The </span>distinction
    between these two types of cases is meaningful for these purposes, it seems
    to me.  Whereas the application of legal principles to the facts in a negligence
    action is very much a fact-driven exercise, the interpretation of a contract – leaving
    aside the factual issues that may underlie the task – is not; it is very
    much a legal exercise.  In my view, Lang J.A. of this Court accurately summarized
    the effect of <i>Housen</i> in <i>MacDougall v. MacDougall</i> (2006), 262
    D.L.R. (4th) 120, at para. 25, when she said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The leading authority on standard of review is <i>Housen
      v. Nikolaisen</i>.<i>  Housen</i> does not address directly the standard
      of review for the interpretation of a contract.  Rather, it canvasses the
      standard of review in a case involving the application of the law of negligence
      to findings of fact.  <i>In that context</i>, it distinguishes among questions
      of fact, questions of law, and questions of mixed fact and law concluding
      that questions of fact are reviewed on the standard of palpable and overriding
      error and questions of law on the standard of correctness.  Where the question
      of fact and of law are inextricably intertwined so that the question is
      one of mixed fact and law, the trial judge’s finding is entitled to deference.
      [Citations omitted; emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    determining the proper standard of review, however, it is important to keep
    in mind the distinction between the nature of the question addressed by the
    trial court (i.e. a question of fact, a question of law, or a question of
    mixed fact and law) and the standard of appellant review of the trial court’s
    disposition of that question.  The distinction does not matter if the trial
    court was answering a question of fact (where the standard of appellant review
    is palpable and overriding error) or a question of law (where it is correctness).  But
    the distinction <i>is</i> important where the question addressed was one
    of mixed fact and law.  To say that a matter raises a question of mixed fact
    and law, by itself, does not mean that the standard of appellate review is
    necessarily one of palpable and overriding error.  As <i>Housen</i> tells
    us, at para. 36, “matters of mixed fact and law lie along a spectrum.”  Thus,
    where the question at issue is determined to be one of mixed fact and law,
    the appellate court must take a further step and go on to locate the precise
    question at the proper point on the <i>Housen</i> spectrum in order to determine
    the applicable standard of appellate review.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Where
    the matter referred to is more a matter of legal principle and sits towards
    the error of law end of the spectrum, the standard is correctness.  Where
    the matter is one in which the legal principle and the facts are inextricably
    intertwined – where the facts dominate, as it were – it falls more towards
    the factual end of the spectrum, and significant deference must be accorded.  Contractual
    interpretation, in my opinion, is generally the type of case that falls within
    the former category, negligence one that generally falls into the latter.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, this distinction between the nature of the question to be determined
    and the standard of appellate review to be applied to that determination
    can help in clarifying a number of cases that might otherwise be misunderstood.  For
    example, in <i>Casurina Limited Partnership et al. v. Rio Algom Ltd. et al. </i>(2004),
    181 O.A.C. 19 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), at para. 34, Feldman J.A. concluded that, “The construction of a written
    instrument is a question of mixed fact and law”.  She did not say, however – nor
    should she be understood to have said, I think – that a deferential standard
    of appellate review must <i>always</i> be applied to the interpretation of
    a contract.  Indeed, in <i>Palumbo v. Research Capital Corp</i>. (2005),
    72 O.R. (3d) 241 (
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), Laskin J.A. observed at para. 32 that, “The standard of review of the
    interpretation of a contract provision ordinarily is correctness.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    palpable and overriding error standard of review, it seems to me, is designed
    to afford deference to trial judges in their essential fact-finding functions,
    including the drawing of inferences from the facts and the determination
    of issues where law and facts are inextricably intermixed.  We leave it to
    trial judges to sort these matters out with good reason.  They have seen
    and heard the witnesses and are attuned to the dynamics of the trial.  In <i>Waxman
    et al. v. Waxman</i> <i>et al. </i>(2004), 186 O.A.C. 201, at para. 292,
    this Court articulated the policy reasons for giving such deference to trial
    judges: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span
style='color:black'>The “palpable and overriding” standard demands strong appellate
      deference to findings of fact made at trial. Some regard the standard as
      neutering the appellate process and precluding the careful second hard
      look at the facts that justice sometimes demands.  This viewpoint is tenable
      only if facts found on appeal are more likely to be accurate than those
      determinations made at trial.  If findings of fact were to be made on appeal
      they might be different from those made at trial. Most cases that go through
      trial and onto appeal will involve evidence open to more than one interpretation.
      Merely because an appellate court might view the evidence differently from
      the trial judge and make different findings is not, however, any basis
      for concluding that the appellate court’s findings will be more accurate
      and its result more consistent with the justice of the particular case
      than the result achieved at trial.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    exercise of interpreting a contract is not essentially a fact-finding exercise,
    however.  As the authorities cited above have noted, there may be questions
    involving the determination of the factual context in which the contract
    was negotiated, or considerations of extrinsic evidence, that evoke the fact-finding
    functions.  Those decisions are to be addressed from the palpable and overriding
    error perspective.  In substance, though, the exercise of interpreting a
    contract is a legal exercise, calling upon the learning and training that
    judges and lawyers acquire over years of experience.  Apart from the truly
    factual aspects that may underlie the task, trial judges have no particular
    advantage over appellate judges in the art of contractual interpretation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, certainty in contract is an important policy value underlying the
    construction of contracts.  This factor alone is sufficient to push the standard
    of review in such cases towards correctness and away from deference.  At
    the very least, contractual interpretation is an exercise that generally
    falls much more towards the error of law end of the <i>Housen</i> spectrum,
    once the factual issues referred to above have been resolved or if –
    as is the case here – they are not in dispute.  The Supreme Court of Canada
    has yet to consider the standard of review in contractual interpretation
    cases post-<i>Housen</i>.
     I am not entirely persuaded that it makes sense to take one type of analysis
    (the <i>Housen</i> analysis) that is designed to discourage appellate courts
    from re-trying <i>the</i> <i>factual issues</i> in cases, and apply its analytical
    paradigm (the facts/mixed fact and law/law spectrum) to what is essentially <i>a
    legal exercise</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    any case, I am satisfied that the decision of the application judge must
    be set aside in this case whether the standard of review is properly one
    of correctness, or palpable and overriding error.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the issues raised on appeal tend toward questions of law, attracting
    review by this court on a standard of correctness.  There were no underlying
    evidentiary or factual issues of a contested nature that the application
    judge was required to resolve.  The arbitration clause was to be interpreted
    in light of its own wording in the context of the Agreement as a whole and
    having regard to the 1999 Rules and the Current Rules.  There was no dispute
    as to what these Rules were.  The application judge was in no better position
    than we are to ascertain the meaning of the arbitration clause in those circumstances. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Even
    if it can be said that the standard is palpable and overriding error, the
    decision cannot stand.  In <i>H.L. v.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    (Attorney General)</i>,<i> </i>[2005] 1 S.C.R. 401, at para. 110, the Supreme
    Court of Canada observed that “clearly wrong” and “unreasonable” are the “functional
    equivalents” of palpable and overriding error.  Respectfully, in my view,
    the arbitration clause cannot reasonably bear the interpretation endorsed
    by the application judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    errors in the application judge’s reasoning manifest themselves particularly
    in two areas: (i) in his failure to give meaning and effect to an important
    term of the arbitration clause, namely the requirement in the conduct of
    arbitration provision that the arbitration was to be conducted “under … the
    then-current rules [of the Institute]”; and (ii) in his interpretation of
    the phrase “to file” in the waiver provision as “to deliver”<i> </i>or “to
    serve”<i> </i>the notice upon Bell, which cannot be sustained.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[36]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    turn briefly now to a review of the relevant principles of contractual interpretation
    before resuming the analysis of the errors in the application judge’s reasons,
    and the interpretation of the arbitration clause itself.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Principles of Contractual Interpretation</span></h4>

    if anything is to be found in the application judge’s reasons about the principles
    of interpretation he invoked.  Broadly speaking, however – as this Court
    noted in <i>Ventas, Inc. v. Sunrise Senior Living Real Estate Investment
    Trust</i> (2007), 85 O.R. (3d) 254, at para. 24 –
    a commercial contract is to be interpreted,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span

    addition, as Doherty J.A. observed in <i>Glimmer Resources Inc. v. Exall
    Resources Ltd.</i> (1999), 119 O.A.C. 78 (C.A.), at para. 17, each word in
    an agreement is not to be “placed under the interpretative microscope in
    isolation and given a meaning without regard to the entire document and the
    nature of the relationship created by the agreement.”  Courts should not
    strain to dissect a written agreement into isolated components and then interpret
    them in a way that – while apparently logical at one level – does not make
    sense given the overall wording of the document and the relationship of the
    parties.  Yet that is precisely the effect of accepting The Plan Group’s
    interpretation of the word “conduct” in the arbitration clause and of minimizing
    or eliminating the import of the words “the then-current rules [of the Institute].”</p>

    understand The Plan Group’s argument to be the following.  Arbitrations are
    governed by the provisions of the <i>Arbitration Act, 1991</i>, except to
    the extent that the parties have contracted out of those provisions, expressly
    or by implication.  With that proposition, I do not quarrel.  The Plan Group
    goes on to submit, however, that they and Bell have not contracted out of
    the provisions of the Act<i> </i>with respect to the commencement of arbitration
    proceedings; instead, they agreed only that the arbitrator, once appointed
    by the parties, would “conduct” the arbitration by applying only the Institute’s
    procedural rules, that is, that portion of the Institute rules dealing with
    the procedural “conduct” of the arbitration by the arbitrator.  The parts
    of the Institute’s rules relating to commencement of the arbitration, the
    administration of the arbitration generally, and anything other than procedural
    conduct, have no application.  Accordingly, The Plan Group properly commenced
    the arbitration, they say, by delivering a preliminary and final Notice of

    application judge accepted this argument.  Respectfully, I do not think it
    is tenable.  As I have mentioned, his interpretation fails to give meaning
    to an important term in the arbitration clause specifying that the arbitration
    would be conducted under the “then-current rules” of the Institute, and further,
    assigned an unsustainable interpretation to the word “file” in the waiver
    portion of the clause.  </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[42]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge did not apply the Current Rules.  His interpretation failed
    to give meaning and effect to a critical term of the parties’ agreement calling
    for conduct of the arbitration under “the then-current rules [of the Institute].”  Early
    in his reasons, at para. 19, the application judge recognized that “[v]iewed
    on its own, the second sentence in the Arbitration Clause constitutes a straight-forward
    agreement to comply with the provisions of both the Act and <i>the rules
    of the Institute from time to time</i>” (emphasis added).  He added that
    he “[saw] no reason not to give effect to the express wording of this provision.”  That
    is not what he did, however.  In this respect, he erred in law by misapplying,
    or failing to apply, the principle that a contract is to be interpreted <span style='color:black'>in
    a manner that gives meaning to all of its terms and avoids an interpretation
    that renders one or more of its terms ineffective.</span></p>
  <h3>            <i><span style='font-weight:normal'>(i)        The Application
        Judge’s Focus on “Conceptual Approaches”</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[43]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Some
    background is necessary to understand how the application judge arrived at
    this result.  The error stems in large part, in my view, from his undue focus
    on the parties’ “conceptual approaches” to the arbitration rather than on
    the wording of the arbitration clause itself.  Indeed, he was persuaded that, “<i>The
    issue on this application [turned] on</i> which of such conceptual approaches
    is applicable” (para. 15; emphasis added).  Instead of asking himself what
    the clear wording of the conduct of arbitration provision meant – viewed
    in the context of the arbitration clause and the Agreement as a whole, and
    the Institute rules – he embarked upon a search for the proper “conceptual
    approach” to the type of arbitration agreed to by the parties.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge’s approach led him to ground his interpretation on a set
    of Institute rules (the 1999 Rules) that had no direct application and, even
    to the extent they provide “context” to the interpretive exercise, they did
    not support the interpretation he adopted.  That error reinforced the narrow
    interpretation of the arbitration clause he embraced, premised on his erroneous
    conclusion as to the nature of the arbitration the parties had agreed to.  This,
    in turn, led to his refusal to give effect to the set of Institute rules
    that were applicable (the Current Rules) because – in his view – they represented
    a “fundamental change” from that flawed view of the nature of the arbitration
    process agreed to.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An
    understanding of the two concepts put forward is therefore important to provide
    insight into his reasoning process.  The two different conceptual approaches
    were summarized by the application judge at paras. 16 and 17 of his reasons:</p>
  <p class=loose style='
text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;color:black'>Plan says that the parties did not agree
      that the Institute would administer any arbitration under the Agreement.
      It submits that the parties agreed only to be bound by the procedural rules
      of the Institute (whether the 1999 Rules or the Current Rules) that apply
      in the conduct of an arbitration after the appointment of an arbitrator,
      and only to the extent that the arbitrator chooses to apply them. Accordingly,
      Plan submits that the rules of the Institute do not apply to determine
      the method of initiating arbitration. It also argues that the Arbitration
      Clause permits an arbitration to be commenced by any means recognized under
      law, including delivery of a notice demanding arbitration, using the language
      of paragraph 23(1)3 of the Act.</span></p>

    do not mean to suggest that the different conceptual approaches to the arbitration
    clause are meaningless.  They shaped a good part of the debate between the
    parties.  However, the meaning of a document is not determined by the conceptual
    approaches taken by the parties to it; it is the meaning of their written
    document that sheds light on their chosen conceptual approach.  Here, the
    application judge tackled the interpretative exercise in the reverse.  He
    ascertained what he believed to be the proper “conceptual approach” to the
    arbitration clause by relying on a set of Institute rules that had no application
    (the 1999 Rules).  He then used that conceptual approach to interpret the
    arbitration clause in a way that would justify his refusal to give effect
    to the set of Institute rules that did apply (the Current Rules).   <i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>But,
    as outlined below, the structure of the arbitration clause read as a whole,
    and in the context of the 1999 Rules and the Current Rules, simply does not
    support the conceptual approach and interpretation advanced by The Plan Group
    and adopted by the application judge, in my opinion.  </p>
  <h3><i><span style='font-weight:normal'>(ii)       The Structure of the Arbitration
        Clause<u></u></span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    structure of the arbitration clause and the sequence in which it evolves
    are themselves of some significance.  In fact, the parties outline their
    concept of the arbitration at the very outset of the clause.  They do not
    agree that they will arbitrate their disputes by first appointing their arbitrator
    and then leaving it to the arbitrator to “conduct” the procedural aspects
    of the arbitration and the hearing in accordance with the procedural portion
    of the rules of the Institute.   Rather, in the first two sentences of the
    arbitration clause, they agree (a) to resolve their disputes by arbitration,
    (b) to resort to a single arbitrator to do so, and (c) to have the arbitration
    conducted by the single arbitrator “under the Arbitration Act, 1991 (Ontario)
    and <i>the then-current rules</i> [of the Institute].”  That is their “conceptual
    approach” to their dispute-resolution mechanism: a single-decision-maker
    arbitration held under the Act and the rules of the Institute in effect at
    the time the dispute arises.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    parties <i>then </i>turn their attention to a number of specifics about the
    arbitration process.  They will themselves select the arbitrator from a panel
    of knowledgeable persons (contrary to the application judge’s reasoning,
    this does “carve out” a right that would otherwise be governed by the rules
    of the Institute).  The arbitrator’s decision will be final and binding,
    and enforceable.  The arbitration will take place in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto.  The arbitrator will not be empowered to award punitive damages.  Finally,
    the parties create what is in effect a limitation period for the bringing
    of claims which is tied to the filing of a notice of arbitration. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    see nothing in the structure or development of the arbitration clause itself
    to suggest that the applicable rules of the Institute are to be limited to
    procedural rules to be applied by the arbitrator.  Indeed, had the parties
    intended that to be the case they would have said “under the then-current
    rules [of the Institute] <i>pertaining to the procedural conduct of the arbitration
    and the hearing by the arbitrator</i>”.  They did not do so.</p>
  <h3><i><span style='font-weight:
normal'>(iii)      The Arbitration Clause in Context: The Agreement, the 1999
        Rules, and the Current Rules</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    view is buttressed by the language of the arbitration clause in the context
    of the Agreement and the rules of the Institute in effect at the time the
    Agreement was negotiated (the 1999 Rules). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    major flaw in The Plan Group’s reasoning is to assume
    – as the application judge appears to have concluded – that the parties agreed
    to be bound (i) by a particular bundle of rules that could conveniently be
    amputated from the 1999 Rules (Part IV – Conduct of the Arbitration) and
    (ii) by any future changes to that specific bundle of rules only.  That is
    not the case, however.  The 1999 Rules may be of some assistance as an interpretive
    aid – they provide part of the context or factual matrix existing at the
    time the Agreement was negotiated – but they do not apply to this arbitration
    directly, nor did the parties ever agree that they would apply to any arbitration
    other than one that happened to be commenced during the period when they
    were in force.  The parties did not agree in the arbitration clause to be
    bound by any particular set of rules.  They agreed only that that the arbitration
    would be conducted under whatever set of Institute rules were operative at
    the time the arbitration in question took place.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Agreement itself was for a five-year term which was renewable.<a href="#_ftn8" name="_ftnref8" title=""><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[8]</span></span></span></a>  The parties had therefore agreed to a long-term
    contractual relationship.    They clearly contemplated that disputes arising
    during that relationship would be resolved through arbitration conducted
    under the rules of the Institute and that those rules could change from time
    to time during the term of the Agreement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover – to
    the extent they may provide some guidance
    – the 1999 Rules do not support the amputation approach to the “conduct” of
    the arbitration or the lack of involvement of the Institute.  The application
    judge drew comfort from the fact that the 1999 Rules are conveniently divided
    in four Parts: Part I –
    General; Part II – Commencing the Arbitration; Part III – The Arbitrators;
    and Part IV – Conduct of the Arbitration.  He found reinforcement for The
    Plan Group’s conceptual approach to the arbitration in these separate divisions
    of those Rules and, in particular, Part IV –
    Conduct of the Arbitration.  The logic does not work, however. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    it would be purely fortuitous if successor Institute rules continued to be
    similarly structured and divided.  While it happened that the 1999 Rules
    were conveniently divided into Parts and that Part IV was conveniently entitled “Conduct
    of the Arbitration”, the Current Rules are not divided in that fashion and
    there is no obvious successor to Part IV.  The Current Rules consist of 49
    individual rules and two Schedules.  How the application judge understood
    the parties would determine what were revisions to or changes in the procedural
    rules in Part IV in such circumstances is unknown.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the view that rules relating to the conduct of the arbitration can be separated
    into those that are “procedural” and those that are not, makes no sense.  Rules
    relating to the conduct of arbitrations are in essence procedural in nature.  They
    are not “substantive”.  They provide for the process or procedure to be followed
    by the parties in having the substantive nature of their dispute resolved
    by the arbitrator.  Indeed, the set up of the 1999 Rules themselves is incompatible
    with the notion that only Part IV relates to “the conduct of arbitrations” (in
    spite of the title to that Part).  The 1999 Rules are entitled: “Rules of
    Procedure for the Conduct of Arbitrations”.  In Article 1(d), they define
    themselves – taken in their entirety – as meaning “these <i>Rules for the
    conduct of arbitrations of the Institute</i>” (emphasis added).  Thus, when
    the parties agreed that the arbitration would be conducted “under … the then-current
    rules [of the Institute]”, they were agreeing – so long as the 1999 Rules
    remained in effect, in any event – that it would be conducted under “these
    Rules for the conduct of arbitrations of the Institute”, which, as worded,
    necessarily refers to the Rules as a whole.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    both the 1999 Rules and the Current Rules provide for the arbitration to
    be administered by the Institute.  Rule 5 of the Current Rules expressly
    states that by agreeing to arbitration under the Rules, the parties agree
    that the arbitration shall be administered by the Institute.  Article 3.1
    of the 1999 Rules likewise stipulates that where parties have provided for
    arbitration under the auspices of the Institute, the arbitration is to take
    place in accordance with the rules in affect at the date of commencement
    of the arbitration.  In both instances, then, once the parties agree to conduct
    the arbitration under the rules of the Institute, they accept that the arbitration
    will be administered by the Institute.  This is consistent with the jurisprudence
    indicating that where parties agree to use the rules of an institutional
    arbitration body, they cannot cherry pick the rules they wish to apply and
    ignore the rest; they are bound to follow all of the rules: see e.g. <i>Spectra
    Innovations Inc. v. Mitel Corp</i>., [1999] O.J. No. 1870 (S.C.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    short, neither the 1999 Rules nor the Current Rules are amenable to be adopted
    by parties intending to administer their arbitration privately.  Had the
    parties wished to adopt an arbitration mechanism that borrowed already existing
    arbitration rules but maintained a privately administered arbitration, they
    could easily have done so, for example, by resorting to the UNCITRAL Arbitration
    Rules or the CPR Institute for Conflict Prevention &amp; Resolution – Non-Administered
    Arbitration Rules.  Both those regimes permit such an opt-in or opt-out.  The
    rules of the Institute do not.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth,
    even the opening provision in Part IV of the 1999 Rules envisages the conduct
    of the arbitration “in all respects” – that is, not just what is touched
    on in Part IV – to be governed by the Act, the Rules, and the parties’ agreements.  Article
    10.1 states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Subject to Article 2.1, the arbitration shall be <i>conducted
      in all respects</i> in accordance with the provision of the <i>Arbitration
      Act</i>, these Rules, the Arbitration Agreements and any other agreement
      of the parties applicable to the conduct of the proceedings. [Emphasis
      added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[61]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the provisions of Part IV clearly contemplate the involvement of the Institute
    in overseeing the arbitration – again, refuting the notion that the arbitration
    was to be a “non-administered”
    arbitration with the parties borrowing only the procedural-conduct related
    rules of the Institute for the purposes of their own arbitration.  Notices,
    statements and written communications may be sent to the other parties “at
    the address set out on the records of the Institute” (Article 11.1).  The
    parties are jointly and severally liable for costs and expenses of the arbitration, “including
    the administrative fees of the Institute”
    (12.1).  The arbitrator or the Institute “may request supplementary deposits
    for the costs and expenses” (12.2).  After the completion of the arbitration
    and delivery of the award, “the Institute shall provide an accounting” (12.3).  Significantly, “the
    Institute”, as well as the arbitrator, “may extend or abridge any time prescribed
    by these Rules”
    (14.2).  Finally, the Institute’s Schedule of Fees completes Part IV.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[62]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect, I am at a loss to understand how the framework of the 1999 Rules – even
    if Part IV of those Rules alone is to be considered – can be said to support
    the non-administrated arbitration interpretation adopted by the application
    judge.  But that is the interpretation that led to his failure to apply the
    Current Rules.<i></i></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    a lengthy analysis of the arbitration clause in light of the 1999 Rules,
    the application judge then went on to consider whether the legal result would
    be any different with regard to the Current Rules.  He answered that question
    in the negative because he concluded that the application of the Current
    Rules would result in a fundamental change from Plan Group’s “conceptual
    approach,” which he had accepted as applicable following his analysis of
    the impact of the 1999 Rules.  At paras. 21, 56 and 59 of his reasons, he
    said:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>For the reasons set out below, I find that the
    Arbitration Clause did not mandate delivery and filing of a Notice of Arbitration
    in compliance with sections 4.1 and 4.3 of the 1999 Rules in order to initiate
    an arbitration. Instead, I find that the Arbitration Clause contemplated
    that after commencement of the arbitration and the appointment of the arbitrator,
    the arbitrator would apply the 1999 Rules during the proceedings.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=loose style='
text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;color:black'>Moreover, even if they had agreed to the
      possibility of a change of some nature to the fundamental conceptual approach
      in the Arbitration Clause by means of a revision of the 1999 Rules, there
      is no basis for concluding that the parties agreed to the involvement of
      the Institute in the administration of any arbitration under the Agreement,
      which is implied by Bell’s position.</span></p>
  <p class=loose align=center style='
text-align:center'><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;color:black'>…</span></p>
  <p class=loose style='
text-align:justify'><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;color:black'>In summary, I do not think that the Court
      can find that the parties agreed to be bound by any revisions to, or replacement
      of, the 1999 Rules beyond revisions to, or changes in, the procedural rules
      in Part IV of the 1999 Rules in the absence of either (1) wording in the
      Arbitration Clause that is more extensive than the phrase relied upon by
      Bell or (2) other contextual evidence, both of which are lacking in this
      proceeding.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[64]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For

    the end, the application judge refused to apply the Current Rules.  In doing
    so, he ignored, and failed to give effect to, the clear and unequivocal language
    of the arbitration clause stipulating that the arbitration was to be conducted
    under “the then-current rules” of the Institute.  The “then-current rules” cannot
    mean anything other that the Current Rules in the context of this arbitration.  The
    Current Rules call for an arbitration administered by the Institute and commenced

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[67]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Clearly,
    where the Current Rules govern the arbitration
    – as in my view they do here – a dispute under an agreement is submitted
    to arbitration by delivering a Notice of Request to Arbitrate to the other
    party, but the arbitration is not deemed to have been “commenced” for purposes
    of its administration until that Notice is filed with the Institute and the
    initial filing fee paid.  The Plan Group has not taken that step.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[68]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Were
    the arbitration governed by the 1999 Rules, The Plan Group would be in a
    different position.  While sections 4.1 and 4.4 of those Rules call for the
    filing of a notice of arbitration with the Institute, the 1999 Rules also
    provided that in the event of a conflict between them and the Arbitration
    Act, the Act prevailed.  Section 23(1)3 of the Act stipulates that an arbitration
    may be commenced in any way recognized by law, including where “[a] party
    serves on the other parties a notice demanding arbitration under the agreement.”  That
    is what the Plan Group did here. </p>

    this arbitration is not to be conducted under the 1999 Rules.  It is to be
    conducted under the Current Rules, which provide that <i>they</i> trump the
    Act (s. 3(a)), and which require a Notice of Request to Arbitrate to be filed
    with the Institute before the arbitration is deemed to have been commenced

  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US style='font-weight:normal'>The Waiver Provision</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[70]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second major error of the application judge is found in his treatment of
    the words “failure <i>to file</i> a notice of arbitration” (emphasis added)
    in the waiver provision of the arbitration clause, which states:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Failure to file a notice of arbitration within
    twelve (12) months after the occurrences supporting a claim constitutes an
    irrevocable waiver of that claim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[71]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    concept of “filing” the notice of arbitration signals that it is to be deposited
    or placed with an organization or institution overseeing the proceeding.  The
    application judge equated it, however, with “delivering” the notice to, or “serving” it
    upon, the other side.  In the context of a legal document relating to the
    resolution of disputes, “filing” cannot be properly or reasonably interpreted
    to bear such a meaning. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[72]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge addressed the meaning of the phrase “failure to file a
    notice of arbitration” only incidentally.  He did so in the course of his
    lengthy examination of what he calls the “Operation of the Arbitration Clause
    in 1999.”  In the result, he rejected
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Bell’s interpretation of the arbitration clause as providing for arbitration
    administered by the Institute and commenced by filing a notice to arbitrate
    with the Institute.  This rejection – or, at least, his conclusion that the
    last sentence of the arbitration clause “is at best equivocal with respect
    to the agreement of the parties” – rests, as he saw it, on the failure of
    the parties to make reference to three things in that sentence, namely:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    failure to specify filing with the Institute in accordance with Article 4.1
    of the 1999 Rules and to identify the “notice of arbitration” as the notice
    of arbitration provided for in Article 4 of those Rules; </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    failure to insert the words “with the Institute”
    after the words “failure to file a notice of arbitration” (leaving open The
    Plan Group’s suggested interpretation equating “filing” with “delivery” to
    the other party, he concludes); and</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>the
    failure to clarify, for limitation purposes, which of the filing requirements
    under Article 4.2 or Article 4.4 – one requires the filing of a single notice;
    the other of three copies – applied.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[73]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    are a number of reasons why this rationale for the rejection of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Bell’s position is not sustainable under the language of the arbitration
    clause, even as interpreted through the lens of the 1999 Rules.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[74]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the first place, the language of the arbitration clause makes it clear that
    the arbitration is to be conducted, not in accordance with the 1999 Rules
    (unless the arbitration happens to be commenced when they are in force),
    but in accordance with the Rules of the Institute in place from time to time – the “then-current
    rules.”  Consequently, there was no reason for the parties to refer specifically
    to any particular provisions in the 1999 Rules.  Indeed, to have done so
    might well have created problems of interpretation in the future because
    references to specific rules might set up a conflict with different rules
    in effect at a later time.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[75]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Secondly,
    the notion that “filing” may be equated with “delivery”
    – or with “service”, or with “giving notice” – in the context of a legal-related
    proceeding is seriously flawed. “Filing” is a well-understood concept in
    the dispute resolution milieu.  It means placing or depositing a document
    with the institutional overseer of the proceeding.  It does not mean delivering
    the document to, or leaving it with, or serving it upon the other party.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[76]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    cursory review of any number of dictionary resources confirms the distinction
    between these concepts.  For example, <i>The Shorter Oxford English Dictionary</i>,
    3d ed., defines the verb “file”
    to mean “to place in due manner among the records of a court or public office,”
    and the verb “deliver” to mean “to hand over to another’s possession or keeping.”<a href="#_ftn10" name="_ftnref10"
title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[10]</span></span></span></a>  Service involves the formal delivery of a document
    to someone:  <i>Black’s Law Dictionary</i>, 8th ed., <i>s.v.</i> “service”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[77]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    the 1999 Rules and the Current Rules of the Institute use the terms “file”, “deliver” and “serve” in
    distinct contexts.  “Filing,” is used in the context of depositing a document
    with the Institute – for example, a notice of arbitration or a pleading.
    Often, filing is what triggers the requirement for an administrative fee
    payment.  Article 4.4 of the 1999 Rules requires the claimant to “<i>file
    at the office of the Institute</i> three copies of the Notice of Arbitration
    together with the administrative fee”.  Articles 4.6 – 4.8 provide that the
    pleadings are to be <i>served</i> on the opposite party <i>and filed</i> with
    the Institute.  Rule 13 of the Current Rules deems the arbitration to have
    been commenced “when a Notice of Request to Arbitrate … <i>has been filed
    with the Institute</i> and the initial filing fee has been paid.”  Under
    the Current Rules, pleadings are “delivered”
    to the parties and to the Institute, but they are not “filed” with the other
    party.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Finally,
    it was not necessary for the parties to the arbitration clause to have added
    the words
    “with the Institute” after the words “failure to file a notice of arbitration”
    in the final sentence of the arbitration clause.  The fact that the notice
    was to be filed with the Institute is self-evident from a reading of the
    arbitration clause as a whole.  The arbitration was to be conducted in accordance
    with the Rules of the Institute. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge’s treatment of the waiver provision in the last sentence
    of the arbitration clause had several unfortunate consequences.  It caused
    him to lose sight of the simple, straight-forward meaning of that stipulation
    in the arbitration clause: a notice of arbitration must be filed with the
    Institute within 12 months of the occurrence upon which the claim is based;
    otherwise the claim is irrevocably waived.  Of equal importance, however,
    it skewed his interpretation of the balance of the arbitration clause.  Instead
    of leading him to conclude – as it should have done – that the parties had
    agreed to an arbitration procedure to be administered by the Institute, his
    erroneous interpretation served to bolster his conclusion that type of arbitration
    agreed to was not one that was to be administered by the Institute and that
    the clause was to be interpreted largely in light of the application of the
    1999 Rules. </p>

    801.  The parties to this appeal are sophisticated commercial parties represented

    principally small, unsophisticated cabling installation contractors.  This
    changed in the early 1990s when electrical contractors entered the structured
    cabling market and larger contractors began providing the same value-added
    services as
    <st1:place

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    developments posed a problem for Bell Gateways because it found it difficult

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[107]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    ease of reference, art. 22 is set out in full, below:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>22.       DISPUTE RESOLUTION</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>22.1    The Parties seek to avoid disputes whenever
    possible.  In the event of a dispute between the Parties concerning any matter
    arising from or connected with this Agreement, the Parties shall use their
    commercially reasonable efforts to settle the dispute in accordance with
    the following procedures:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a)       A Party which considers that a dispute
    exists shall provide written notice (in this paragraph 22.1(a), a “Notice
    of Dispute”) to the other Party to the attention of the other Party’s representative.  For
    this purpose the nominated representative of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Bell shall be its Assistant Vice-President Internetworking and the nominated
    representative for [Plan] shall be either of Bill Kurtin or Marshel Cohen.  (Either
    Party may change its representative(s) on written notice to the other Party.)  Following
    the provision of a Notice of Dispute to a Party’s representative, the representatives
    of the Parties will forthwith make commercially reasonable efforts to, in
    good faith, resolve all disputes which are the subject of such notice in
    no more than 10 days from the date of the notice.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b)       Should the dispute between the Parties
    not be resolved pursuant to the settlement process set out in Paragraph 22.1(a)
    hereof during the 10 day period referred to therein, the dispute shall be
    referred for resolution to Bell’s Vice-President Gateways and to either of
    Bill Kurtin or Marshel Cohen.  Following such referral, such persons will
    forthwith make commercially reasonable efforts, in good faith, to resolve
    all disputes which are the subject of such referral within 10 days from the
    date of such referral.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>22.2    <i>Bell and [Plan] will settle by arbitration
      any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement or any Sub-contract
      that is not finally resolved pursuant to Section 22.1 hereof. </i> <i>A
      single arbitrator will conduct the arbitration under the Arbitration Act,
      1991 (Ontario) and the then-current rules of the Arbitration and Mediation
      Institute of Ontario Inc</i>. Bell and [Plan] will select the arbitrator
      from a panel of persons knowledgeable in business information and the construction
      industry.  The decision and award of the arbitrator will be final and binding
      and the award so rendered may be entered in any court having jurisdiction
      thereof.  The arbitration will be held in
    <st1:place w:st="on">

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE REASONS OF THE APPLICATION JUDGE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[108]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge understood the application to have raised a single issue:
    did the Arbitration Clause require a party to file a “Notice of Request to
    Arbitrate” with the Institute in order to commence arbitration?  He noted
    that the parties had very different conceptions of how the Arbitration Clause
    operated and that the issue turned on which conceptual approach applied.  At
    paras. 16 and 17 of the reasons, the application judge set out the parties’ conceptual
    approaches:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>Plan says that the parties did not
      agree that the Institute would administer any arbitration under the Agreement.&nbsp; It
      submits that the parties agreed only to be bound by the procedural rules
      of the Institute (whether the 1999 Rules or the Current Rules) that apply
      in the conduct of an arbitration after the appointment of an arbitrator,
      and only to the extent that the arbitrator chooses to apply them.&nbsp; Accordingly,
      Plan submits that the rules of the Institute do not apply to determine
      the method of initiating arbitration.&nbsp;
    It also argues that the Arbitration Clause permits an arbitration to be commenced
    by any means recognized under law, including delivery of a notice demanding
    arbitration, using the language of paragraph 23(1)3 of the Act.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <span

    any arbitration under the Agreement; and (2) any such arbitration must be
    commenced by filing a Notice to Arbitrate with the Institute.&nbsp;
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Bell relies on the reference in the second sentence of the Arbitration Clause
    to the
    “then-current rules” of the Institute, and the substitution of the Current
    Rules for the 1999 Rules including, in particular, section 5 of the Current
    Rules.&nbsp;
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Bell says that, collectively, these provisions have the result that the parties
    are bound by the Current Rules of the Institute in their entirety including,
    in particular, the provisions respecting commencement of an arbitration. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[109]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge summarized the two relevant sets of Institute rules at
    paras. 5-14 of the reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b><i><span lang=EN>The 1999 Rules</span></i></b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>The Rules of the Institute that applied
      at the time of execution of the Agreement (the “1999 Rules”) were divided
      into four parts under the following headings:
    “General”, “Commencing the Arbitration”, “The Arbitrators” and “Conduct of
    the Arbitration”.&nbsp; The following provisions have relevance to the issue
    herein.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>First, in Part I, section 2.1 provided
      that the provisions of the <i>Arbitration Act, 1991</i>, <a name=reflex-statute-18320921></a><span style='font-family:Verdana'>S.O.
      1991, c.17</span> (the “Act”) would govern in the event of any
      conflict between the Act and the 1999 Rules.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>Second, in Part II (entitled “Commencing
      the Arbitration”), section 4.1 required that written notice of a proposed
      arbitration be given by a party initiating arbitration to the Institute
      and all other necessary parties.&nbsp; Section 4.2 provided that the arbitration
      would be deemed to commence on the date on which the Institute received
      a Notice of Arbitration from the claimant (presumably, but not expressly,
      the written notice contemplated by section 4.1).&nbsp; </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>Third, in Part IV (entitled “Conduct
      of the Arbitration”), section 10.1 provided that the arbitration was to
      be conducted in accordance with the Act, the 1999 Rules and any applicable
      agreement between the parties including the arbitration agreement. </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b><i><span lang=EN>The Current Rules</span></i></b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>Since at least 2003, the Institute
      has applied the ADR Institute of Canada, Inc. National Arbitration Rules
      (the “Current Rules”).&nbsp; The Current Rules are not divided into discrete
      sections in the manner of the 1999 Rules.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>Section 3 of the Current Rules provides
      that the Current Rules, rather than the Act, govern in the event of any
      conflict, except to the extent that the parties may not lawfully contract
      out of the provisions in the Act.&nbsp; </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>The first sentence of section 5,
      upon which
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Bell places considerable reliance, provides that “[b]y agreeing to the Rules,
    the parties agree that the arbitration shall be administered by the Institute”.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>Section 11<b> </b>of the Current
      Rules requires the delivery of a “Notice of Request to Arbitrate” to the
      respondent and to the Institute to commence an arbitration. Section 11
      also specifies in detail the required content of a Notice of Request to
      Arbitrate.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>Section 13 provides that an arbitration
      is deemed to have commenced when a Notice of Request to Arbitrate has been
      filed with the Institute and the initial filing fee has been paid.&nbsp; </span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>More generally, in addition to the
      matters addressed by the 1999 Rules, the Current Rules address a number
      of procedural and substantive issues that are also addressed in the Act.&nbsp; The
      Current Rules essentially constitute a complete code for the commencement
      and conduct of an arbitration.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[110]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge considered the operation of the Arbitration Clause at the
    time the Alliance Agreement was executed in 1999 and then considered whether
    the legal result was different under the Current Rules.  He found that the
    Arbitration Clause did not mandate delivery and filing of a Notice of Arbitration
    in compliance with ss. 4.1 and 4.3 of the 1999 Rules in order to initiate
    arbitration.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[111]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Instead,
    the application judge interpreted the Arbitration Clause as providing that
    after commencement of arbitration and the appointment of the arbitrator,
    the arbitrator would apply the Institute rules to the conduct of the arbitration.  He
    reached this conclusion because, on its face, he found the Arbitration Clause
    favoured Plan’s interpretation.  He gave several reasons for this conclusion,
    the most significant of which may be summarized as follows:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>1.  <u>The wording and order of the second and third
      sentences in the Arbitration Clause</u>.  The Arbitration Clause does not
      say that any dispute or arbitration under the Alliance Agreement is to
      be resolved in accordance with the Institute rules.  Instead, it refers
      specifically to the “conduct” of the arbitration being subject to the Act
      and the then-current Institute rules.  Thus, “on a plain reading”, the
      Arbitration Clause limits the reach of the 1999 Rules to the conduct of
      the arbitration rather than compliance with all of the Institute rules.  Part
      IV of the 1999 Rules is entitled “Conduct of the Arbitration”.  It is separate
      and distinct from Part II of the 1999 Rules which is entitled “Commencing
      the Arbitration.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>2.  <u>The Arbitration Clause contemplates a procedure
      for appointment of an arbitrator outside the Rules</u>.  Had the parties
      intended the reference in the second sentence of the Arbitration Clause
      to constitute an agreement to comply with all of the 1999 rules, the third
      sentence should have carved the appointment process out of the rules.  The
      fact that it doesn’t suggests the parties did not intend all of the Institute
      rules to apply.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>3.  <u>Plan’s interpretation is more consistent with
      the context in which the Arbitration Clause was negotiated</u>.  The application
      judge gave a detailed explanation for this view, based on the 1999 Rules
      and the wording of the Arbitration Clause.  For example,
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Bell’s interpretation was based on its position that the Institute would
    administer the arbitration.  However, this position was based on s. 5 of
    the Current Rules, for which there was no counterpart in the 1999 Rules.  Moreover,
    there is nothing in the Arbitration Clause to say that the Institute would
    administer the arbitration.  Further, Plan’s interpretation is consistent
    with the 1999 Rules which are divided into parts, making it feasible that
    only the parts governing conduct of the arbitration would apply.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[112]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    concluding that the Arbitration Clause did not mandate compliance with the
    1999 Rules for commencement of arbitration, the application judge considered
    whether the Current Rules had that effect.  This question arose because the
    Arbitration Clause provides that the arbitration will be conducted in accordance
    with the
    “then-current” Institute rules.  
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Bell argued that if the Arbitration Clause did not mandate filing of a Notice
    to Arbitrate under the 1999 Rules, the result is different because of ss.
    3 and 5 of the Current Rules.  The effect of those sections, read together
    with the Arbitration Clause,
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Bell argued, was that any arbitration must be commenced in accordance with
    the Current Rules, <i>i.e</i>. by filing a Notice of Request to Arbitrate
    with the Institute under s. 11.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN>[113]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>After
    outlining Plan’s response to this argument, the application judge explained
    that t<span lang=EN>he difference between the parties turned on fundamentally
    different views of the nature of the agreement between the parties in 1999
    with respect to (1) the scope of the rules to which the parties agreed to
    be bound, and (2) the involvement of the Institute in the administration
    of an arbitration.  He concluded that the parties agreed that the arbitrator
    was to apply the procedural rules of the Institute in effect from time to
    time in the conduct of the arbitration.  He did not agree that either (1)
    the remaining rules of the Institute were also to be applied in respect of
    any arbitration under the Agreement; or (2) the Institute was to administer
    any such arbitration.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN>[114]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span
lang=EN>Thus, the issue was whether, by the reference to the then-current rules
      of the Institute in the second sentence of the Arbitration Clause, the
      parties agreed to accept the possibility that their agreement could be
      overridden by a substitution of the Current Rules for the 1999 Rules by
      the Institute.&nbsp; </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[115]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>He
    gave two reasons for rejecting the notion that by referring to the “then-current” Institute
    rules, the parties intended that they would be bound by anything more than
    changes to procedural rules.  First, he found it unlikely that the parties
    turned their minds to the possibility that by virtue of a change to the Institute
    rules, the fundamental approach to arbitration embodied in the Arbitration
    Clause could be changed without their involvement.  There was nothing in
    the limited scope of the 1999 Rules or the Act to suggest the possibility
    of such a fundamental change.  He saw it as far more likely that the parties
    envisaged that possible changes to the Institute rules would relate to the
    conduct of arbitration.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[116]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second reason, given at paras. 55-58 of the reasons, is a contextual consideration:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>Most important, the Agreement was
      the product of a negotiation between two sophisticated commercial parties
      represented by legal counsel.&nbsp; In the absence of wording suggesting
      otherwise, the Court should proceed on the basis that the conceptual approach
      to arbitration set out in the Arbitration Clause was meaningful to the
      parties.&nbsp; In the absence of express wording suggesting otherwise,
      I do not think the Court should interpret the acknowledgment in the Arbitration
      Clause of possible revisions to the 1999 Rules to constitute an agreement
      to be bound by rules that change the fundamental conceptual approach in
      the Arbitration Clause without the consent of the parties.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>Moreover, even if they had agreed
      to the possibility of a change of some nature to the fundamental conceptual
      approach in the Arbitration Clause by means of a revision of the 1999 Rules,
      there is no basis for concluding that the parties agreed to the involvement
      of the Institute in the administration of any arbitration under the Agreement,
      which is implied by Bell’s position.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>If the parties were agreeable to
      Institute administration of any such arbitration, they could have selected
      this approach from the outset.&nbsp; Despite the more limited set of provisions
      in the 1999 Rules, they could have agreed that the arbitration was to be
      governed in all respects by the 1999 Rules.&nbsp;
    Alternatively, they could have addressed the possibility of future Institute
    involvement in the Arbitration Clause.&nbsp; They did neither.&nbsp; The
    failure to do either reinforces the conclusion that the parties did not agree
    to accept Institute administration of any arbitration.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>In addition, the position of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Bell implies that the parties agreed to accept all revised rules of the Institute,
    sight unseen and without any opportunity to consider the consequences thereof
    for any arbitration under the Agreement.&nbsp; While I think it is reasonable
    to contemplate an agreement of this nature extending to revisions of procedural
    rules designed to facilitate the conduct of an arbitration, it is unreasonable
    to expect that the parties in this proceeding would have agreed to be bound
    by a revision that broadened the scope of the operation of the rules of the
    Institute.&nbsp; For example, I do not think it is reasonable to conclude
    that the parties agreed to comply with any revision to the rules that imposed
    additional costs of arbitration upon the parties without their consent by
    imposing Institute involvement in respect of any arbitration. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[117]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    the application judge could not find that the parties agreed to be bound

    Clause or other contextual evidence.  </p>

  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[121]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Before
    turning to the standard of review, however, a preliminary matter needs to

  <h4><span lang=EN-US>A PRELIMINARY MATTER</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[122]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Dell</i> at
    paras. 84-86, the Supreme Court laid down “a general rule that in any case
    involving an arbitration clause, a challenge to the arbitrator’s jurisdiction
    must be resolved first by the arbitrator.”  The court should “depart from
    the rule of systematic referral to arbitration only if the challenge to the
    arbitrator’s jurisdiction is based solely on a question of law” or a question
    of mixed law and fact where “the questions of fact require only superficial
    consideration of the documentary evidence in the record.”  Further,
    “[b]efore departing from the general rule of referral, the court must be
    satisfied that the challenge to the arbitrator’s jurisdiction is not a delaying
    tactic and that it will not unduly impair the conduct of the arbitration
    proceeding.”  Thus, “even when considering one of the exceptions, the court
    might decide that to allow the arbitrator to rule first on his or her competence
    would be best for the arbitration process.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[123]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    court has endorsed a similarly deferential approach that mandates referral
    to arbitration where it is arguable that a dispute falls within the scope
    of an arbitration clause: see <i>Dalimpex Ltd. v. Janicki</i> (2003), 64
    O.R. (3d) 737 (C.A.); <i>Greenfield Ethanol Inc. v. Suncor Energy Products
    Inc.</i>, 2007 ONCA 823 (C.A.), aff’g [2007] O.J. No. 3104 (S.C.); <i>Dancap
    Productions Inc. v. Key Brand Entertainment, Inc.</i> (2009), 246 O.A.C.
    226 (C.A.).  Moerover, although the court has concurrent jurisdiction to
    decide the arbitrability of a dispute under the <i>Arbitration Act, 1991</i>,
    it will construe broadly drafted arbitration clauses generously, “consistent
    with the legislative policy… which favours arbitration over litigation where
    the parties so provide by agreement”: see <i>Woolcock v. Bushert</i> (2004),
    246 D.L.R. (4th) 139 (Ont.

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[124]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, it may well have been preferable had the application judge been
    asked to refer the whole matter to arbitration, including the dispute regarding
    the validity of commencement.  Such an approach would have been consistent
    with the parties’ agreement in art. 22.2 to have all disputes “arising out
    of or related to” the Alliance Agreement resolved by arbitration.  Further,
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City

    Bell’s stance appears to be a delaying tactic, and, as the decision of my
    colleague may permanently prevent the arbitration from taking place, it cannot
    be said that the court proceedings have been “best for the arbitration process”.  However,
    the application judge did not refer the issue of commencement to the arbitrator
    and neither party asked this court to approach the appeal on this basis.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[125]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having
    said that, it is significant that the Order is consonant with the <i>Dell </i>principles,
    set out above, and the jurisprudence of this court.  The Order does not state
    that Plan has commenced arbitration.  It simply says that as of the relevant
    date, it was not necessary to file a notice with the Institute to commence
    arbitration pursuant to art. 22.2 of the
    <st1:place

    <st1:City w:st="on">

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[126]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not see the form of the Order as some kind of happenstance.  The Order
    takes its form from the conscious decision of counsel for both parties to
    ask the application judge to perform a single task and decide a single question:
    interpret the Arbitration Clause and determine whether, on December 14, 2005,
    a party had to file a notice with the Institute to commence arbitration.  The
    parties did not ask the application judge to decide if Plan had commenced
    the arbitration nor did he decide that question.  Consequently, it is open
    to
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Bell to raise that matter as an issue once the parties are before the arbitrator.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[127]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    raise this preliminary matter for a single purpose – it provides an additional
    reason for dismissing the appeal.  If the Order stands, the parties can appear
    before the arbitrator and have him decide whether Plan commenced the arbitration.  That
    is, the arbitration will be conducted in a way that conforms with the guidance
    of this court and that of the Supreme Court. </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>THE STANDARD OF REVIEW IN CONTRACTUAL INTERPRETATION</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[128]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with much of what my colleague has said generally in respect of appellate
    review on matters of contractual interpretation.  However, I disagree with
    the view that the question of contractual interpretation in this appeal attracts
    a standard of review of correctness.  To explain my position, I must recap
    some of the discussion on the guiding legal principles.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            </span><i><span
lang=EN-US>The Guiding Legal Principles  </span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[129]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    my colleague noted, historically, interpretation of a contract was treated
    as a question of law, reviewable on a standard of correctness.  However, <i>Housen
    v. Nikolaisen</i>, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235 dictates that a more nuanced approach
    be taken by reviewing courts.  The standard of review in contractual interpretation – as
    in other types of civil proceedings – depends on the nature of the question
    that the trial judge decided: was it one of law, fact, or mixed law and fact?  Questions
    of law are reviewable on a standard of correctness.  Questions of fact are
    reviewable on a standard of palpable and overriding error, or the “functional
    equivalents” of “clearly wrong”,
    “unreasonable” or “not reasonably supported by the evidence”: <i>H.L. v.
    Canada (Attorney General)</i>, [2005] 1 S.C.R. 401, at para. 110.  Questions
    of mixed law and fact, however, lie along a spectrum, with some questions
    being more akin to questions of law and others being more akin to questions
    of fact.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[130]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    para. 36, <i>Housen</i> explains the approach that appellate courts are to
    take when determining the standard of review to apply to a question of mixed
    law and fact. Such matters</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN>lie along a spectrum.&nbsp; Where,
      for instance, an error with respect to a finding of negligence can be attributed
      to the application of an incorrect standard, a failure to consider a required
      element of a legal test, or similar error in principle, such an error can
      be characterized as an error of law, subject to a standard of correctness.&nbsp; Appellate
      courts must be cautious, however, in finding that a trial judge erred in
      law in his or her determination of negligence, as it is often difficult
      to extricate the legal questions from the factual.&nbsp; It is for this
      reason that these matters are referred to as questions of “mixed law and
      fact”.&nbsp; Where the legal principle is not readily extricable, then
      the matter is one of “mixed law and fact” and is subject to a more stringent
      standard.&nbsp; The general rule… is that, where the issue on appeal involves
      the trial judge’s interpretation of the evidence as a whole, it should
      not be overturned absent palpable and overriding error.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN>[131]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>While <i>Housen </i>is
    a negligence case, this court recognized in <i>MacDougall v. MacDougall </i>(2005),
    262 D.L.R. (4th) 120, that the <i>Housen</i> principles inform the standard
    of review to be applied by appellate courts when reviewing decisions based
    on the interpretation of contracts.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN>[132]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Writing
    for the court, Lang J.A. explained in <i>MacDougall</i> at para. 30,<i> </i>that
    the trial judge must apply the proper principles of contract interpretation
    and that a failure to follow such principles is an error of law attracting
    review on a correctness standard.  At para. 31, Lang J.A. states that when
    the task of interpretation includes consideration of extrinsic evidence or
    a determination of the factual matrix, the trial judge is making findings
    of fact or drawing factual inferences.  Such findings are not to be overturned
    except in the case of palpable and overriding error.  At para. 32, she states
    that where the trial judge applies legal principles to the language of the
    contract in the context of the relevant facts and inferences, he or she is
    applying law to fact, which is a question of mixed law and fact.  Similarly,
    if the question is an
    “inextricable intertwining” of law and fact, it is a question of mixed law
    and fact.  Questions of mixed law and fact are to be reviewed in accordance
    with the principles from <i>Housen</i>, quoted above: <i>MacDougall</i> at
    para. 33.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[133]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Based
    on <i>Housen</i> and in accordance with <i>MacDougall</i>, I understand that
    an appellate court should determine the standard of review in matters of
    contractual interpretation in the following way.  Begin by identifying the
    nature of the question that the trial judge decided.  This first step is
    extremely important as a mischaracterization of the question can obscure
    the true issues and alter the applicable standard of review.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[134]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    the question is either one of law or fact, the standard of review is straight
    forward – the former is to be reviewed on a standard of correctness; the
    latter on a standard of palpable and overriding error or its “functional
    equivalents”.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[135]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If,
    however, the question is one of mixed law and fact, the standard of review
    may be either correctness or palpable and overriding error.  To decide which
    of those standards applies, the appellate court must determine whether the
    trial judge made an “extricable” error in legal principle in arriving at
    his or her interpretation.  In the area of contractual interpretation, errors
    in principle include the failure to apply proper principles of contractual
    interpretation,<a

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[136]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    an error of law can be identified (<i>i.e.</i> extricated), the trial judge’s
    interpretation is subject to review on a standard of correctness.  Where,
    however, the alleged error cannot be extricated from the factual findings,
    the trial judge’s interpretation is to be subjected to a more deferential
    standard of review.  In such cases, appellate courts should review the decision
    on a standard of palpable and overriding error or its “functional equivalents”.  </p>
  <h4 style='line-height:normal'><i><span lang=EN-US>Determining the Standard
        of Review in Matters of Contractual Interpretation </span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[137]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    determining the standard of review in accordance with these principles, it
    is useful to recognize that three matters complicate the application of the <i>Housen </i>principles
    to matters of contractual interpretation.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[138]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    it can be difficult to determine the nature of the question.  For example,
    in the present case
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Bell asserts that the contractual interpretation question decided by the
    application judge is one of law whereas Plan says it is a question of mixed
    law and fact.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN>[139]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    if the question is one of mixed law and fact, it is difficult to establish
    where it lies on the spectrum.  A spectrum is not an “either-or” proposition.  I
    do not think it is possible to place a question at a precise point on the
    spectrum.  At most, it appears to me that a question of mixed law and fact
    can be seen to lie more closely toward one end of the spectrum, rather than
    the other.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN>[140]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, however, <i>Housen </i>resolves this second difficulty as it provides
    that if the trial judge has not made an extricable error of law, the question
    is to be reviewed on the standard of palpable and overriding error. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[141]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    third challenge arises from the nature of the task that the trial judge performs
    when interpreting a contract.  When interpreting contracts, trial judges
    are engaged in the application of settled legal principles – which are designed
    to give effect to the mutual intentions of the parties – to the contractual
    provisions.  However, the “proper”
    interpretation often depends, to a greater or lesser extent, on a consideration
    of the factual matrix and the weighing of evidence.  Thus, the very nature
    of the task performed by the trial judge can make it difficult to determine
    whether an “extricable”
    error in law has been committed.      </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            </span><i><span
lang=EN-US>A Deferential Standard of Review is Owed in the Present Case </span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[142]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the application judge’s interpretation of art. 22.2 of the Alliance
    Agreement is reviewable on a standard of palpable and overriding error or
    its functional equivalents of clearly wrong, unreasonable or not reasonably
    supported by the evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[143]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    reach this conclusion for three reasons.  First, the question in this case
    is one of mixed law and fact.  Second, the application judge committed no
    extricable error of law.   Third, there are sound policy reasons for a deferential
    standard of review in this case.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>1.  The question is one of mixed law and fact</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[144]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    I have mentioned, the first step in determining the standard of review is
    to identify the nature of the question that the application judge decided.  My
    colleague treats the question as one of law or, if mixed law and fact, as
    falling at the correctness end of the spectrum.  I do not agree. <a name=reflex-caselaw-45650842></a></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[145]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    reasons of the application judge make it clear that his interpretation of
    the Arbitration Clause depends on the application of legal principles to
    the language used by the parties with due consideration for the factual matrix,
    particularly the facts as he found them to be in 1999 when the Alliance Agreement
    was entered into.  As I explain more fully below, it is not possible to interpret
    the Arbitration Clause without regard to such factual determinations.  Accordingly,
    the application judge was deciding a question of mixed law and fact. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[146]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>My
    colleague gives three reasons for viewing the question as one of law or strongly
    akin to a question of law.  The first is that the application judge heard
    the matter in writing, without oral evidence, and the same written materials
    are available to this court.  However, the law is clear that a first instance
    judge’s findings are to be accorded deference by an appellate court, even
    when he or she heard no oral evidence: <i>Equity Waste Management of Canada
    v. Halton Hills (Town) </i>(1997), 35 O.R. (3d) 321 (C.A.), at pp. 334-35.  There
    are numerous reasons for giving deference to factual findings of trial judges
    apart from those that arise when the trial judge has heard testimony firsthand
    and observed witnesses: <i>Housen</i> at para. 24. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[147]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second reason given by my colleague for holding that a correctness standard
    applies is that there are no underlying evidentiary or factual issues of
    a contested nature.  This, however, does not necessarily make the question
    one of law alone.  To reiterate, a question of mixed law and fact is one
    in which the trial judge “applies the legal principles to the language of
    the contract in the context of the relevant facts and inferences”: <i>MacDougall</i> at
    para. 32. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[148]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the recent decision of <i>Dumbrell v. The Regional Group of Companies Inc</i>.<i> </i>(2007),
    85 O.R. (3d) 616 (
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), at para. 52, Doherty J.A. explained that contractual interpretation involves
    the interplay between the words of a contract and the context in which those
    words were chosen:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>No doubt, the dictionary and grammatical meaning
    of the words (sometimes called the “plain meaning”) used by the parties will
    be important and often decisive in determining the meaning of the document.  However,
    the former cannot be equated with the latter.  The meaning of a document
    is derived not just from the words used, but from the context or the circumstances
    in which the words were used.  Professor John Swan puts it well in <i>Canadian
    Contract Law</i> (Markham, Ont.:

    Butterworths, 2006) at 493:<i></i></p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>There are a number of inherent features of
    language that need to be noted.  Few, if any words, can be understood apart
    from their context and no contractual language can be understood without
    some knowledge of its context and the purpose of the contract.  Words, taken
    individually, have an inherent vagueness that will often require courts to
    determine their meaning by looking at their context and the expectations
    that the parties may have had.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[149]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the present case, the application judge was called on to interpret the Arbitration
    Clause within the Alliance Agreement as a whole and in the context of these
    parties, in the particular circumstances at the time the Alliance Agreement
    was created, with regard to the expectations the parties had at that time.  That
    is, the application judge was called on to decide a question of mixed law
    and fact, not one of law alone.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[150]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    third reason given by my colleague for a correctness standard of review is
    that the interpretation of a contract is
    “very much a legal exercise”.  I agree that interpreting the language of
    a contract is a legal exercise.  That, however, does not change the fact
    that the application judge was required to interpret art. 22.2 within its
    unique factual matrix.  The application judge did not decide a question of
    wide or general application nor did he answer a broad jurisdictional question.  In
    fact, he answered a very narrow, discrete question – as of December 2005,
    did art. 22.2 of the Alliance Agreement require a party to commence arbitration
    by means of filing a notice with the Institute?  Identifying the precise
    question that the application judge was called on to decide reinforces my
    view that the true nature of the question is one of mixed law and fact.  The
    question builds into it the factual context, namely, the situation of the
    parties and their expectations at the time the agreement was entered into.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            2.  The application judge committed no extricable
      error of law</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[151]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    interpreting a particular clause of an agreement, the trial judge is engaged
    in drawing a legal inference as to what the parties intended from the objective
    standpoint of the law of contract. Such an inference, although a conclusion
    of law, may be dependent on findings of fact regarding the words of the document
    and the surrounding circumstances.  In such situations, the meaning of the
    words in the contract cannot be divorced from their context and the factual
    circumstances in which the agreement was made.  That is, it may be inherently
    difficult to “extricate the legal questions from the factual” in matters
    of contractual interpretation, just as in negligence: <i>Housen</i> at para.
    36.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[152]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    is just such a case.  The application judge held that the Arbitration Clause
    did not require the delivery and filing of a notice of arbitration with the
    Institute in order to commence the arbitration.  In his view, the Arbitration
    Clause contemplated that after the commencement of arbitration and the appointment
    of the arbitrator, the arbitrator would apply the Institute’s procedural
    rules, as amended from time to time.  The application judge held that the
    subsequent replacement of the 1999 Rules with the Current Rules could not
    retroactively change the intention of the parties as of 1999 when the Alliance
    Agreement was executed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[153]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    drawing a legal conclusion as to what the parties mutually intended from
    the words of the contract and the surrounding circumstances, the application
    judge was involved in a context-driven inquiry that depended on the weighing
    of documentary and other evidence, findings of fact and factual inferences.
    The end result is a legal conclusion that cannot be neatly or easily separated
    from its factual underpinnings.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[154]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    the application judge did not recite the principles of contractual interpretation
    when interpreting the Arbitration Clause, he carefully and thoughtfully applied
    them.  He thoroughly dealt with the arguments of both parties and gave cogent
    reasons for choosing the interpretation advanced by Plan.  In so doing, he
    indicated the principles of contractual interpretation that guided him.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[155]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    my reading of his reasons, the application judge interpreted art. 22.2 in
    the context of the whole agreement and the factual matrix.  Unlike my colleague,
    as I explain below, I view the application judge as having given meaning
    and effect to the requirement in the second sentence of art. 22.2 that the
    arbitration be conducted under the then-current Institute rules and to the
    meaning of “file”
    in the Waiver.  In my view, his reasons demonstrate no extricable error of
    law.       </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            3.  Policy reasons favour a deferential approach
      in this case<i></i></span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[156]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Since
    the nature of the question is one of mixed law and fact, in the absence of
    an extricable error of law, this court should accord deference to the trial
    judge’s interpretation.  This conclusion flows from <i>Housen </i>and is
    based on sound judicial policy.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[157]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Although
    it may be difficult to identify the nature of the question and the standard
    of review – particularly where questions of mixed law and fact<i> </i>are
    involved – <i>Housen </i>provides guidance in two ways.  First, it grounds
    the issue of the standard of review in the different roles that trial and
    appellate courts play.  The “primary role of trial courts is to resolve individual
    disputes based on the facts before them and settled law”.  The primary role
    of appellate courts, by contrast, “is to delineate and refine legal rules
    and ensure their universal application”: <i>Housen</i> at para. 9. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[158]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
    of the different roles of trial and appellate courts, the precedential value
    of the question can be of some relevance in determining its nature and the
    standard of review.  If the question is “apt... to be of much interest to
    judges and lawyers in the future”, or if the dispute is over a
    “general proposition that might qualify as a principle of law”, it is more
    likely to be a question of law reviewable for correctness: <i>Housen</i> at
    para. 28, citing
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on"><i>Canada</i></st1:country-region>
    <i> (Director of Investigation and Research) v. Southam Inc.</i>, [1997]
    1 S.C.R. 748, at para. 37.  Conversely, where “the matrices of facts at issue… are
    so particular, indeed so unique” that the decision would not have precedential
    value, it “draws nigh to being an unqualified question of mixed law and fact” that
    is generally subject to a more stringent standard, unless the error is traceable
    to an error in principle that would engage the law-making function of an
    appellate court: <i>Housen</i> at paras. 28, 36-37; <i>Southam</i> at para.
    37. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[159]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the present case, the interpretation of the Arbitration Clause is of little
    or no precedential value.  The dispute regarding art. 22.2 depends on a unique
    matrix of facts that is particular to two parties to a specific negotiated
    agreement.  Further, there is no identifiable error in legal principle at
    issue that would engage the law-making function of the appellate court.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[160]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    second way in which <i>Housen</i> provides guidance is that it directs appellate
    courts to be cautious in finding that a trial judge erred in law in his or
    her determination of negligence because it is “often difficult to extricate
    the legal questions from the factual”: <i>Housen</i> at para. 36.  In my
    view, and for the same reason, this court should be reluctant to find the
    application judge’s interpretation to be attributable to an error of law.   As
    I have explained, the application judge was engaged in the application of
    settled legal principles to the evidence and the facts of the case.  His
    legal conclusion regarding the parties’
    intentions is an “inextricable intertwining of fact and law”: <i>MacDougall</i> at
    para. 33.<b><i></i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[161]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore,
    a deferential approach reflects sound judicial policy.  In <i>Bradscot (MCL)
    Ltd. v. Hamilton-Wentworth Catholic District School Board</i> (1999), 42
    O.R. (3d) 723 (C.A.), Laskin J.A. deferred to a trial judge’s interpretation
    of a contractual provision that was reasonable (and therefore not “unreasonable”),
    noting that the appellant had not alleged any error in the application of
    the relevant legal principles.  In my view, this approach is consistent with <i>Housen</i>.  As
    discussed above, where the question is one of mixed law and fact and no extricable
    error in principle has been made, deference should be paid to the trial judge’s
    interpretation of a contractual provision in the absence of palpable and
    overriding error or an interpretation that is clearly wrong, unreasonable
    or not reasonably supported by the evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[162]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Bradscot</i>,
    Laskin J.A. referred to his earlier decision in <i>Gottardo Properties (Dome)
    Inc. v.
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto (City)</i> (1998), 162 D.L.R. (4th) 574 (Ont. C.A.).  In <i>Gottardo</i>,
    he stated at para. 48:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=verdana>Deference is desirable for
      several reasons: to limit the number and length of appeals, to promote
      the autonomy and integrity of the trial or motion court proceedings on
      which substantial resources have been expended, to preserve the confidence
      of litigants in those proceedings, to recognize the competence of the trial
      judge or motion judge and to reduce needless duplication of judicial effort
      with no corresponding improvement in the quality of justice.</span><b><i></i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span>[163]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    passage was quoted with approval by the majority in <i>Housen</i> at para.
    12 in relation to findings of fact and the drawing of factual inferences.  In
    relation to questions of mixed law and fact, the majority held that “in the
    absence of a legal error or a palpable and overriding error, a finding of
    negligence by a trial judge should not be interfered with”: <i>Housen</i> at
    para. 31.  As the majority explained at para. 32, since both legal and factual
    inferences </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>are intertwined with the weight assigned to the
    evidence, the numerous policy reasons which support a deferential stance
    to the trial judge’s inferences of fact, also, to a certain extent, support
    showing deference to the trial judge’s inferences of mixed fact and law. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[164]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    contractual interpretation, as in negligence, it can be inherently difficult
    to extricate the legal questions from the factual.  Owing to the fact-sensitive
    nature of the inquiry – ascertaining the parties mutual and objective intentions – courts
    frequently make conclusions regarding the “proper interpretation” of a contractual
    provision without directly applying the interpretive principles or canons
    of construction.  Conclusions as to the “proper interpretation” of a contractual
    clause summarily express conclusions of law as to what the parties are objectively
    taken to have intended based on a set of facts.  In these situations, as
    I have said, the interpretation of a contract is a question of mixed law
    and fact.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[165]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    courts express opinions on the “proper interpretation” of a contract, there
    may be more than one reasonable interpretation. It is not uncommon, for instance,
    for various guidelines or canons of construction to point in different directions
    on a set of facts and for different courts to reach different conclusions
    regarding the interpretation of a particular clause. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[166]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    a deferential approach to the application judge’s interpretation of a contract,
    given the absence of an identifiable<span
style='font-size:12.0pt;line-height:200%'> </span>error of law, is grounded in
    sound judicial policy and consistent with the guidelines laid down by the
    Supreme Court in <i>Housen</i>.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>INTERPRETING THE ARBITRATION CLAUSE</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[167]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    application judge’s interpretation of the Arbitration Clause underlies the
    Order.  If his interpretation is reviewed on a palpable and overriding error
    standard, I see no basis on which to interfere with it.  He made no extricable
    error in legal principle and his interpretation is not “plainly unreasonable”.  While
    one might reasonably interpret the Arbitration Clause other than as the application
    judge did, that is a function of its wording and does not make the application
    judge’s interpretation unreasonable.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[168]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    any event, however, as I have said, in my view, the application judge was
    correct in finding that a party did not have to file a notice with the Institute
    in order to commence arbitration.  I reach that conclusion based on the following
    chain of reasoning:</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>            1.  The Arbitration Clause does not specify
    how arbitration is to be commenced;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>2.  The Arbitration Clause does specify that the arbitration
    will be conducted in accordance with the <i>Arbitration Act, 1991 </i>and
    the then-current Institute rules;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>3.  Article 24.6 of the Alliance Agreement says that
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario law governs;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>4.  In 1999, when the Alliance Agreement was executed
    and at the time of the dispute in 2005, the <i>Arbitration Act, 1991 </i>was
    the
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario law that applied to the Alliance Agreement;</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>5.  Section 23(1) of the <i>Arbitration Act, 1991 </i>reads
    as follows:   </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>An arbitration may be commenced in any way recognized
    by law, including the following: </p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>1.  A party to an arbitration agreement serves
    on the other parties notice to appoint or to participate in the appointment
    of an arbitrator under the agreement.</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>2.  If the arbitration agreement gives a person
    who is not a party power to appoint an arbitrator, one party serves notice
    to exercise that power on the person and serves a copy of the notice on the
    other parties.</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>3. <i>A party serves on the other parties a
      notice demanding arbitration under the agreement</i>.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>6.  Thus, as the application judge held, in 2005, the
    Arbitration Clause did not require a party commencing arbitration in respect
    of a dispute under the Alliance Agreement to file a notice of request to
    arbitrate with the Institute.  It appears from s. 23 of the Act that filing
    such a notice would have been an acceptable way of commencing arbitration,
    just as was the method chosen by Plan (<i>i.e. </i>service on Bell of a notice
    demanding arbitration under the agreement); </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>7.  The Waiver does not detract from this reasoning; </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>8.  This reasoning promotes a result that is reasonable,
    fair and sensible.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[169]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Below,
    I explain how I arrive at the foregoing reasoning.  Before doing so, I make
    the following observations about the principles that guide the courts when
    interpreting contracts.     </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            </span><i><span
lang=EN-US>The Principles that Guide Contractual Interpretation</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[170]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    primary goal when interpreting a contract is to give effect to the intention
    of the parties.  There is no need to repeat the general principles of contractual
    interpretation which assist in achieving that goal as they are well set out
    in the reasons of the majority.  However, the following quotation from <i>Consolidated-Bathurst
    Export Ltd. v. Mutual Boiler and Machinery Insurance</i>, [1980] 1 S.C.R.
    888, at p. 901 provides useful guidance:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><i>[T]he normal rules of construction lead a court
      to search for an interpretation which, from the whole of the contract,
      would appear to promote or advance the true intent of the parties at the
      time of entry into the contract</i>.  Consequently, literal meaning should
      not be applied where to do so would bring about an unrealistic result or
      a result which would not be contemplated in the commercial atmosphere in
      which the insurance was contracted.  <i>Where words may bear two constructions,
      the more reasonable one, that which produces a fair result, must certainly
      be taken as the interpretation which would promote the intention of the
      parties</i>.  Similarly, an interpretation which defeats the intention
      of the parties and their objective in entering into the commercial transaction
      in the first place should be discarded in favour of an interpretation of
      the policy which promotes a sensible commercial result.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[171]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>What,
    then, was the true intent of the parties in February 1999 when they entered
    into the Alliance Agreement?  Did they intend that if a dispute arose between
    them that could not be resolved through good faith discussions, the party
    with the claim could commence arbitration in only one way, namely, by complying
    with the Institute’s rules for commencement of arbitration?  I turn now to
    the analysis which leads me to conclude that the answer to that question
    is “no”.  <b><i></i></b></p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            </span><i><span
lang=EN-US> Article 22  </span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[172]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Arbitration Clause does not stand alone – it is but one part of art. 22.  Article
    22 establishes a two-step process for dispute resolution.  Given that art.
    22.2 governs the second step in a two-step dispute resolution process, the
    first of which is contained in art. 22.1, both logic and the guiding principles
    of contractual interpretation dictate that article 22 be considered as a
    whole.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[173]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Article
    22 reflects the parties’ shared intention to resolve disputes quickly, co-operatively
    and without recourse to the courts.  The first step in the dispute resolution
    process is laid out in art. 22.1.  Pursuant to art. 22.1(a), a party who
    considers a dispute to exist must provide a designated representative of
    the other party with written notice to that effect.  Within 10 days of the
    date of the notice, designated representatives of both parties must make
    commercially reasonable efforts, in good faith, to resolve the dispute.  If
    the dispute is not resolved within 10 days, pursuant to art. 22.1(b) the
    dispute “shall” be referred to other designated persons in the two organizations
    (the “second tier”).  Within a further 10 days, the second tier must again
    make commercially reasonable efforts, in good faith, to resolve the dispute.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[174]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is worthy of note that while art. 22.1(a) makes it clear how the dispute
    resolution process is to be commenced (<i>i.e. </i>by written notice delivered
    by the party alleging the dispute to a designated representative of the other
    party), art. 22.1(b) does not indicate how the dispute is to be referred
    to the second tier should the initial good faith discussions fail to resolve
    the dispute.  That is, it says nothing about how to commence the second tier
    discussions.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[175]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>If
    the dispute is unresolved through the good faith efforts required by art.
    22.1, the parties move to the second step of the dispute resolution process.  Art.
    22.2 governs the second step; it states that the parties “will settle by
    arbitration” any disputes unresolved through the first step.  It goes on
    to stipulate that a single arbitrator, selected by the parties from a panel
    of persons knowledgeable in business information and the construction industry,
    will conduct the arbitration in Toronto in accordance with the <i>Arbitration
    Act, 1991</i> and the then-current rules of the Institute.  Failure to file
    a notice of arbitration within 12 months “after the occurrences supporting
    a claim”
    constitutes an irrevocable waiver of that claim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[176]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Three
    things are immediately apparent on reading art. 22.2.  First, it says nothing
    expressly about how arbitration is to be commenced.  In that regard, it stands
    in sharp contrast with art. 22.1(a) which, as has been noted, spells out
    the requirements for commencing the dispute resolution process.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[177]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    while art. 22.2 is silent on how the arbitration is to be commenced, as already
    indicated, a number of other aspects of the arbitration process are specified.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[178]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    the Waiver is in the last sentence of art. 22.2 and it says nothing expressly
    about commencement of arbitration.  That makes sense.  The Waiver, on which
    more is said below, is an important provision which affects substantive rights.  How
    a party commences arbitration is a procedural matter.  </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            </span><i><span
lang=EN-US>How is arbitration to be commenced under art. 22.2?</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[179]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    return to the question which lies at the heart of this appeal.  In February
    1999, when the parties entered into the Alliance Agreement, did they intend
    that arbitration could be commenced by only one method, namely, in accordance
    with the then-current Institute rules?  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[180]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Art.
    22.2 does not say that and, with respect, there is no basis on which to imply
    such an intention.  What is clear is this: the parties intended that if the
    good faith efforts called for by art. 22.1 failed to resolve the dispute,
    the matter would go to arbitration.  How was the arbitration to be commenced?  In
    the absence of any specified manner, I see no reason why the Arbitration
    Clause must be interpreted so as to permit a party to commence arbitration
    by one method only, namely, compliance with the Institute rules.  The parties
    to the Alliance Agreement are sophisticated, experienced businesses.  Legal
    counsel assisted in the drafting of the agreement.  Had they intended to
    stipulate a single method by which to commence the arbitration process, that
    matter would have been specified, just as the method for commencement of
    the first step in the process in art. 22.1 is specified and just as so many
    other aspects of the arbitration process are specified.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[181]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    art. 24.6 of the Alliance Agreement provides that it is to be governed and
    construed in accordance with
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario law.<a

'>[16]</span></span></span></a>  Accordingly, in 1999, when the parties entered
    into the Alliance Agreement, the <i>Arbitration Act, 1991</i> applied to
    the agreement.  Section 2(1) of the <i>Arbitration Act, 1991 </i>provides
    that, subject to exceptions that do not apply in this case, the Act applies
    to arbitrations conducted under an arbitration agreement.  “[A]rbitration
    agreement” is defined as “an agreement by which two or more persons agree
    to submit to arbitration a dispute that has arisen or may arise between them”.  Clearly,
    art. 22.2 is such an agreement.  Thus, as I have said, the <i>Arbitration
    Act, 1991</i> applied to art. 22.2.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[182]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Consequently,
    I see the true intention of the parties –
    as expressed in the Arbitration Clause – to be that arbitration could be
    commenced “in any way recognized by [
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario] law”.  Thereafter, the parties would select an arbitrator with the
    specified background who would conduct the arbitration in accordance with
    the Act and the Institute rules, as amended.     </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[183]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    interpretation is consistent with the flow and structure of art. 22.  As
    has been noted, the method for commencing the dispute resolution process
    itself is spelt out in art. 22.1(a) but, thereafter, nothing is specified
    in terms of how notice should be given to move the dispute resolution forward.  Art.
    22.1(b) says nothing as to how the dispute is to be placed before the second
    tier, should the initial good faith discussions fail.  Similarly, art. 22.2
    says nothing as to how to commence arbitration should both tiers of the good
    faith discussions fail.  This suggests that the parties’ intention was that
    once the dispute resolution process was commenced, they would co-operate
    in seeing it through to settlement.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[184]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is also consistent with the Alliance Agreement as a whole.  Under the terms
    of the Alliance Agreement,
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Bell and Plan agreed to work collaboratively and cooperatively.  The Alliance
    Agreement is not a standard form contract, nor is it a contract in which
    one party provides goods or services and the other pays for them.  It is
    not a detailed agreement.  Rather, it sets out the parties respective rights
    and obligations in broad terms to create a unique arrangement in which the
    parties agree to work together to deliver expensive, complicated, technical
    electrical cabling projects.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[185]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    parties’ agreement to extensive levels of co-operation in all aspects of
    the joint venture is evident throughout the Alliance Agreement, beginning
    with the preambles in which the parties recognize that each has unique capabilities
    and express the desire to cooperate in providing their services on cabling
    projects.  In art. 2, the parties agree to co-ordinate their marketing efforts
    in respect of existing and new customers and to collaborate in pursuing business
    opportunities.  In art. 3, Plan agrees to refer to
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Bell all of its cabling project customers in the region and
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Bell agrees to use Plan to provide customer services to all of its customers
    in the region.  In arts. 8 and 9, the parties agree to provide one another
    with all training necessary to support customer inquiries in respect of deliverables.  The
    parties also agree to forego any other similar types of alliance agreements
    in the region and to work together on all new cabling projects.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[186]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    short, within the structure created by the Alliance Agreement, co-operation
    between the parties is the hallmark.  Similarly, the interpretation I offer
    for how arbitration is to be commenced relies on the parties’ co-operation,
    within the agreed-on structure provided by art. 22. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[187]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore,
    the factual matrix supports this interpretation.  The parties had been working
    together in a co-operative fashion.  As has been mentioned, they were sophisticated,
    experienced business people working with legal counsel.  Their whole approach – both
    from a legal and a business perspective – was to set out, in broad strokes,
    that which they wished to accomplish and then co-operate in seeing the matter
    through to fruition.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[188]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    interpretation given by my colleague is restrictive and technical – arbitration
    can be commenced in only one way, by filing a notice with the Institute.  In
    my view, for the reasons already given, such an interpretation is not consistent
    with the flow and structure of the overall dispute resolution process in
    art. 22, with the Alliance Agreement as a whole or the factual matrix.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[189]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Furthermore,
    the interpretation adopted by my colleague relies heavily on the statement
    in art. 22.2 that the arbitration is to be conducted under the Institute’s
    rules.  There are two responses to this.  First, recall that the sole reference
    to the Institute in art. 22.2 is in the second sentence, which provides that
    the arbitrator “will conduct the arbitration under the Arbitration Act, 1991
    (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:State
 w:st="on">
    Ontario) and the then-current rules of the…
    Institute”.  One cannot conduct an arbitration unless it has been commenced.  Thus,
    on a plain reading, art. 22.2 says that the Institute rules are to apply
    to the conduct of the arbitration, not to its commencement.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[190]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    and in any event, even if “conduct” of the arbitration is taken to include
    its commencement, I see no reason to constrain it to include commencement
    only by compliance with the Institute rules.  That is not what art. 22.2
    says.  Art. 22.2 says that the arbitrator is to conduct the arbitration under
    both the <i>Arbitration Act, 1991</i> and the Institute rules.  Both contain
    rules for the commencement of arbitration.  There is nothing in the wording
    of art. 22.2 to suggest that the Institute’s rules are to govern commencement.  Indeed,
    there is force to the argument that as art. 22.2 refers to the <i>Arbitration
    Act, 1991</i> before the Institute rules, the parties’ evinced an intention
    that the rules set out in the <i>Arbitration Act, 1991</i> are to govern
    commencement of arbitration.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[191]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Nor
    do I see <i>Spectra Innovations Inc. v. Mitel Corp.</i>, [1999] O.J. No.
    1870 (S.C.) as supportive of the interpretation advanced by my colleague.  The
    wording of the clause in <i>Spectra </i>is materially different than the
    Arbitration Clause.  The clause in <i>Spectra </i>provided that the arbitration
    tribunal should determine the matter “<i>acting in accordance with the Rules
    [of the ICC]</i>” (emphasis added).  However, the Arbitration Clause stipulates
    that the arbitrator “will <i>conduct</i> the arbitration <i>under the Arbitration
    Act, 1991 </i>(
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario) and the then-current [Institute rules]” (emphasis added). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[192]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    as the application judge noted at para. 41 of his reasons: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>While the arbitration clause in <i>Spectra</i> also
    addresses the appointment of the arbitrator by the parties (in this case,
    an arbitration board), it does not refer to compliance with the applicable
    rules in the context of the conduct of the arbitration by the arbitrator
    so appointed.  This difference points to a specific intention in the Arbitration
    Clause that the arbitrator, once appointed, would be required to apply the
    procedural rules in the Act and in the rules of the Institute, as in effect
    from time to time, rather than to a more general intention that the Institute
    was to administer all aspects of the arbitration, as was held to be the case
    in <i>Spectra</i>. Accordingly, rather than supporting the interpretation
    of the Arbitration Agreement proposed by Bell, I think that the decision
    in <i>Spectra</i> actually supports the interpretation of Plan by identifying
    the unique feature of the Arbitration Clause that distinguishes it from clauses
    that would contemplate the administrative involvement of the Institute.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[193]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    in <i>Spectra</i>, the court relied on the factual matrix in interpreting
    the clause.  After observing that the applicant was based in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">Singapore</st1:country-region>
    , the respondent was based in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario and the agreement concerned the supply of product in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">India</st1:country-region>
    , the court in <i>Spectra</i> concluded at para. 17:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>…The I.C.C. court which was founded in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Paris in 1923, has a long-standing reputation as one of the leading institutions
    for arbitration of international commercial disputes. <i>In this context</i>,
    it would be altogether logical that the parties would want to resolve any
    dispute by setting up an arbitration board acting in accordance with the
    Rules of conciliation and arbitration of the I.C.C.  [Emphasis added.]</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[194]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No
    such inter-jurisdictional commercial considerations operate in the case at
    bar, in which all aspects of the business arrangement take place in Ontario
    and the parties have expressly chosen to have their agreement governed by
    Ontario law. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[195]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the Waiver is an exclusionary provision which warrants strict interpretation
    as its operation affects substantive rights.  In contrast, the clause in <i>Spectra</i> dealt
    with matters of mere procedure.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            </span><i><span
lang=EN-US>The Waiver</span></i></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[196]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Waiver is the mechanism chosen by the parties to ensure that claims under
    the Alliance Agreement are dealt with in a timely fashion – file a notice
    of arbitration within 12 months of the occurrences which support a claim
    or the claim is to be treated as irrevocably waived.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[197]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Bell contends that the Waiver dictates that arbitration could have been commenced
    in only one way – by filing a notice with the Institute.  It says that the
    word “file” in the Waiver must mean to file with the Institute and, as the
    Notice was not filed and issued through the Institute, Plan’s claim is extinguished.  In
    large measure, my colleague accepts that contention by interpreting the word “file” in
    the Waiver as a crucial indicator of the parties’ intention that the Institute
    rules were to govern the commencement of arbitration.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[198]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect, I see the Waiver to be of little significance in determining whether
    the arbitration has been commenced.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[199]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>“Waiver” of
    a claim and “commencement” of arbitration are not synonymous.  The Waiver
    may be a defence to be raised in the arbitration but it does not dictate
    whether and how the arbitration is to be commenced.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[200]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly,
    I see no reason to adopt an unnecessarily restrictive meaning of “file”.  “File” is
    not a defined term in the Alliance Agreement.  As the parties intended that
    disputes would be resolved without recourse to the courts, it does not make
    sense to ascribe to that word a narrow, strictly legal meaning.  Where the
    parties wanted to closely circumscribe some aspect of the dispute resolution
    process they did so – good faith discussions were to be conducted within
    10 days of the date of the notice of dispute, the arbitration was to be in
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto, the arbitrator was to be selected from a panel of persons with a
    particular background and so on.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[201]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Further,
    the broader dictionary meaning of “file”
    includes delivery and receipt and to do that which is necessary to commence
    a legal proceeding.  The common meaning of
    “file” includes “actual delivery” to the recipient (as opposed to simply
    mailing) or to initiate proceedings by proper formal procedure.  For example, <i>The
    Canadian Dictionary of Law</i>, 3d ed. defines “file” as follows: </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>File</b>. v. 1.&nbsp;To leave with the appropriate
    office for keeping. 2.&nbsp;Register. 3.&nbsp;Requires actual delivery. A
    mailed document is not filed until received by the other party.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[202]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>These
    broad meanings of “file” are consistent with the commencement of arbitration
    under s. 23 of the <i>Arbitration Act,</i> <i>1991</i>.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[203]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> To
    the extent that there is ambiguity in the Waiver, as it is an exclusionary
    provision, it ought to be construed strictly against the forfeiture of legal
    rights.  This principle of interpretation is particularly apt in the present
    case where Plan sought to commence arbitration in a manner which complied
    with a plain reading of the Arbitration Clause and with the express purpose
    of protecting its rights and
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Bell raised no objection to the form of the purported commencement of arbitration
    until many months later.  The broader interpretation advanced here recognizes
    commencement of arbitration by any means allowable in law and would not work
    an injustice by causing the loss of rights.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[204]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    do not intend to suggest that the Waiver is irrelevant or unimportant.  To
    the contrary.  On its own, the Waiver is important as it is the mechanism
    that the parties chose to ensure that claims would be raised in a timely
    fashion.  Furthermore, if this matter were permitted to proceed to arbitration,
    as I have mentioned, it raises a significant issue for the arbitrator to
    decide.    </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>            </span><i><span

    the quotation from <i>Consolidated Bathurst</i> set out above, the Supreme
    Court states that where a provision admits of more than one construction,

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[206]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    result, on the interpretation advanced above, is that Plan may assert that
    it commenced arbitration on December 12, 2005, when it delivered to Bell
    the Notice pursuant to s. 23 of the <i>Arbitration Act, 1991</i>, if not
    earlier.  That matter, however, remains to be determined by the arbitrator.  I
    say that because, as I have already explained, the Order does not declare
    that Plan has commenced arbitration and, if so, on what date.  By answering
    the question in the manner in which the parties had framed it (<i>i.e. </i>in
    the negative), the application judge left the question of when Plan commenced
    arbitration, if at all, to be determined by the arbitrator.<b><i></i></b></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[207]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[209]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    this interpretation promotes a fair result as it would permit the arbitration
