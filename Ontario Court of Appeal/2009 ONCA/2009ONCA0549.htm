  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was convicted of second degree murder following a trial before
    a judge and jury in the Superior Court.  The sole issue raised on this appeal
    is whether the trial judge erred by leaving s. 21(2) of the <i>Criminal Code </i>with
    the jury as a basis for liability for murder. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant and several friends had formed a group or gang, the members of
    which became embroiled in a series of altercations with the deceased and
    several of his friends.  On the day of the murder, the appellant organized
    and lead a coordinated attack on the deceased in a public park.  The victim
    died of a stab wound inflicted during the attack by one of the appellant’s
    associates.  The Crown’s position at trial was that the appellant was guilty
    of first degree murder as he was a party to a planned and deliberate murder.  The
    appellant admitted that he had participated in a planned and deliberate assault
    but argued that he lacked the <i>mens rea </i>for either first or second
    degree murder and that he should be found guilty only of manslaughter.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown asked the trial judge to leave both s. 21(1) and s. 21(2) with the
    jury. The appellant disputed the applicability of s. 21(2) and the issue
    was fully argued prior to the trial judge’s instructions to the jury.  Section
    21(2) provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Where two or more persons form an intention in
    common to carry out an unlawful purpose and to assist each other therein
    and any one of them, in carrying out the common purpose, commits an offence,
    each of them who knew or ought to have known that the commission of the offence
    would be a probable consequence of carrying out the common purpose is a party
    to that offence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Relying
    on <i>R. v. Simpson,</i> [1988] 1 S.C.R. 3<i>,</i> the appellant argued that,
    given his admission that he was an aider and abettor to the assault that
    led to the death, he could not be a party to murder based on s. 21(2).  This
    submission was premised on the argument that liability is <i>either</i> under
    s. 21(1), which deals with aiding and abetting, <i>or</i> under s. 21(2),
    and that s. 21(2) is only applicable if the conduct of the accused cannot
    constitute aiding or abetting.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Before
    instructing the jury, the trial judge gave a considered ruling on this point
    and found, essentially on the basis of this court's decision in <i>R. v.
    Rochon</i> (2003), 173 C.C.C. (3d) 321, that s. 21(2) was applicable.  The
    appellant had admitted a common unlawful purpose with the actual killer to
    assault the victim.  The trial judge ruled that it was open to the Crown
    to prove that the appellant knew that the commission of murder would be a
    probable consequence of carrying out that common unlawful purpose, and thereby
    render the appellant guilty of second degree murder. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
      pause to observe that when s. 21(2) is engaged and the charged offence
      is murder, the Supreme Court of Canada has held that s. 7 of the <i>Charter</i> requires
      that the accused must have actual knowledge that murder would be a probable
      consequence of the unlawful purpose.  A conviction for murder cannot be
      based on the ground that the accused <i>ought</i> to have known that murder
      would be a probable consequence: see <i>R. v. Logan</i>, [1990] 2 S.C.R.
      731, holding that when s. 21(2) is applied to murder, the words “or ought
      to have known” are of no force and effect. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge was alive to this constitutional requirement.  He instructed
      the jury that to convict the appellant of murder under s. 21(2) on the
      basis of a common intention to carry out an unlawful purpose, the Crown
      must prove that the appellant actually knew that one of the participants
      in the assault would probably kill the victim.  He explained to the jury
      that a finding that the appellant knew that the victim would probably be
      killed meant actual knowledge, and not that the appellant “ought to have
      known” that the victim would probably be killed.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    agree with the appellant that as this was a planned attack, and given the
    appellant’s admission of his involvement, had the jury convicted him under
    s. 21(1) as an aider or abettor, the verdict would almost certainly have
    been guilty of first degree murder.  It follows that s. 21(2) likely was
    the route taken by the jury to arrive at the verdict of guilty of second
    degree murder. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    I do not agree with the appellant that the trial judge erred in leaving s.
    21(2) with the jury. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Rochon</i>,
    at paras 62-3, MacPherson J.A., writing for the court, held:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span class=bold1><span style='color:black;font-weight:normal;'>[The
        appellant]</span></span><span class=bold1><span style='color:black'> </span></span>submits
        that liability as a party pursuant to s. 21(2) of the <i>Code</i> should
        not have been left with the jury because the circumstances relating to
        the alleged unlawful purpose (to kill [the victim]) were indistinguishable
        from the offence charged (first degree murder): see <i>R. v. Simpson</i>,
        [1988] 1 S.C.R. 3 at 15, 38 C.C.C. (3d) 481.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I disagree. The trial judge instructed the jury
    that the unlawful common purpose was to assault [the victim] whereas the
    offence [the other party] committed while carrying out the assault was murder.
    Although there is an overlap in the conduct comprehended by the two offences,
    that does not detract from the fact that they are separate offences: see <i>R.
    v. Vang</i> (1999), 132 C.C.C. (3d) 32 (Ont. C.A.) at 39-41; and <i>R.
    v. Light</i> (1993), 78 C.C.C. (3d) 221 (B.C.C.A.) at 253-54. Moreover,
    it is important to note that the trial judge instructed on s. 21(2) only
    with respect to possible verdicts of second degree murder and manslaughter.
    [The appellant] was convicted of first degree murder. Accordingly, even if
    the judge erred by deciding to include s. 21(2) in his charge (and I conclude
    he did not), the error is of no moment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Prior
    to the oral hearing of this appeal, counsel for the appellant took the position
    that <i>Rochon</i> was wrongly decided and requested a five judge panel to
    reconsider that decision.  That request was refused by the Chief Justice.  Despite
    the denial of a five judge panel, in his factum the appellant essentially
    conceded that <i>Rochon</i> was dispositive of the issue and maintained the
    argument that it was wrongly decided.  For the first time in oral argument,
    counsel for the appellant advanced the submissions that either <i>Rochon</i> was
    distinguishable or that the statement as to the application of s. 21(2) in
    that case was obiter and not binding upon us.  Needless to say, this was
    a highly irregular manner of proceeding, potentially unfair to the Crown
    and awkward for the court.
     Very often, in such a situation, we would either refuse to entertain such
    a late blooming submission or adjourn the appeal.  However, as the argument
    is without merit, I view it to be in the interests of justice that we deal
    with it now.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    my view, the point at issue on this appeal was decided in <i>Rochon</i> and
    that decision is binding upon us.  As I read the above quoted passage, MacPherson
    J.A. clearly decided that s. 21(2) is applicable to render a party guilty
    of second degree murder where the common unlawful purpose is assault and
    the accused knew that murder would be a probable consequence of carrying
    out that assault.  While MacPherson J.A. added that, in the circumstances
    of the case before him, even if the trial judge had erred in leaving s. 21(2)
    with the jury, no substantial wrong or miscarriage of justice had occurred,
    that alternate ground for dismissing the appeal does not subtract from the
    primary holding that s. 21(2) was applicable in the circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Moreover,
    and quite apart from <i>Rochon</i> and <i>stare decisis</i>, I see no merit
    in the appellant’s submission.  In my view, the decisions relied on by the
    appellant, <i>Simpson</i> and <i>R. v.
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Jackson </i>(1991), 68 C.C.C. (3d) 385 (Ont.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:PostalCode
 w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ),<i> </i>are readily distinguishable from this case.  Those cases point
    out that there is a fundamental difference between liability as an aider
    or abettor under s. 21(1), which is premised upon actual participation in
    the crime charged, and liability under s. 21(2), which is premised upon the
    knowledge (in the case of murder) that the crime charged would probably be
    committed by another person with whom the accused had an intention in common
    to carry out a different unlawful purpose.  Where the common intention is
    to commit the very crime charged, s. 21(2) has no application.  As pointed
    out in <i>Simpson</i>, it would simply make no sense to instruct the jury
    that
    “when two or more form an intention to murder the deceased and, in murdering
    the deceased, one of them murders the deceased, each of them who knew that
    murdering the deceased would be a probable consequence of carrying out the
    murder of the deceased is guilty of murder.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    the facts of this case, however, we encounter no such logical difficulty.  The
    crime charged, second degree murder, is distinct from the common unlawful
    purpose to carry out an assault.  I see no merit in the submission that s.
    21(2) cannot apply because the assault was a lesser included offence of the
    crime charged.  We were not referred to any authority to support that proposition
    and it would seem to fly in the face of the very purpose of s. 21(2).  If
    an accused forms a common intention with others to commit a less serious
    included offence, such as assault, knowing that one of them will probably
    commit a more serious offence, such as murder, both the letter and the spirit
    of s. 21(2) support a conviction for murder.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly,
    I would dismiss the appeal.</p>
