    appellant raises three grounds of appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    the appellant argues that the trial judge erred by dismissing the appellant’s
    mistrial application based on a reasonable apprehension of bias. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>During
    the cross-examination of Dr. Nussbaum, the defence raised this issue based
    on what the appellant claimed to have overheard the trial judge discussing
    about that evidence with his deputy in the corridor outside the courtroom.  According
    to the appellant’s written statement provided to his counsel, on the first
    occasion, the trial judge is alleged to have said: “Despite Dr. Nussbaum’s
    low key and quiet manner, he presents a very effective case and he is so
    far the most credible and insightful witness.”  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the second occasion, later the same day, the trial judge is alleged by the
    appellant to have said to his deputy: “These two are going to be more objective
    because they were court appointed and not hired by the defence.”  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When
    the issue was raised, the trial judge readily conceded that he had made comments
    to his deputy which could have been overheard by the appellant when the two
    were in the corridor at the same time.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge, however, disputed the appellant’s version of what he said.  He
    said that he had commented about the low key manner in which Dr. Nussbaum
    testified, but that he did not say that Dr. Nussbaum was the most credible
    and insightful witness so far.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    relation to the second occasion, again, the trial judge did not accept the
    appellant’s version of what he said to his deputy.  While the trial judge
    could not recall his exact words, he said that what he conveyed to his deputy
    was the idea that there was a certain aura of objectivity that court appointed
    experts start with, whereas experts retained by a party are often viewed
    as likely to side with the party that hired them.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    do not accept the submission that the trial judge’s “version” of what he
    recalled saying “evolved over time”.  The trial judge, at the very outset
    when the matter was first raised, said that he could not recall the exact
    words he used but rather, only the general nature of his discussion, the
    substance of which did not change over time.  The comments were of a general
    nature and did not reflect the trial judge’s views on the credibility of
    witnesses.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant did not give evidence about what he was alleged to have overheard.  The
    allegations were put before the court through the submissions of counsel.
    There was no evidence called.  In particular, no effort was made to call
    the deputy to whom the comments were allegedly made nor the escorting officer
    who was with the appellant at the time the comments are alleged to have been
    made.  When an allegation of bias or reasonable apprehension of bias is made
    against a trial judge, counsel have an obligation to prepare and provide
    the court with a record of the evidence they rely on in support of this serious
    allegation.  Such a record then is available for the trial judge’s consideration
    and ruling, as well as for any appellate review of that judge’s decision
    down the road.  There was no such record in this case.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    test for reasonable apprehension of bias is a high one.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>What would an informed person dealing with the matter
    realistically and practically and having thought the matter through conclude? <i>Committee

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    our view, the trial judge held a factual inquiry, sufficient to clear the
    air and permit appellate review.  On the record before him, his determination
    was the appropriate one.  We would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    second ground of appeal raised relates to the trial judge’s finding that
    the appellant failed to meet his burden to establish the defence of not criminally
    responsible.  At trial, the sole issue in relation to this defence boiled
    down to whether the appellant knew his actions were morally wrong at the
    time he killed his mother and on this the experts were divided.  In careful
    and lengthy reasons, the trial judge reviewed all the evidence and stated
    why he preferred the evidence of Doctors Ramshaw and Nussbaum over that of
    Doctors Bloom and Pollack. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge’s expansive reasons demonstrate that he considered all the evidence,
    including the five pieces of evidence referenced in paragraph 44 of the appellant’s
    factum.  Nevertheless, he was not persuaded that the appellant had made out  the
    defence.  The weighing of conflicting medical opinions is within the exclusive
    province of trial judges. Absent palpable and overriding error in his assessment
    of the evidence – and none has been shown –
    there is no basis for this court to interfere with the trial judge’s decision
    concerning the availability of this defence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    third ground of appeal relates to sentence. This was a particularly brutal
    killing involving breach of trust and some evidence of preplanning. In all
    the circumstances, we are satisfied that the sentence was a fit one.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    conviction appeal is dismissed.  Leave to appeal sentence is granted and
    the sentence appeal is dismissed.</p>
