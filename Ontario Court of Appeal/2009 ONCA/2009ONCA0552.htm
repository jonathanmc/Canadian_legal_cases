    appellant, together with his friend A.B., was charged with several offences
    in relation to his alleged non-consensual sexual activity with a 15-year
    old female complainant.  Following a relatively short trial before a judge
    and jury, the appellant was convicted of sexual assault to which another
    person, A.B., was a party and breach of recognizance.  He was acquitted on
    a charge of sexual assault and, pursuant to directed verdicts, on charges
    of sexual assault causing bodily harm and forcible confinement.  He was sentenced
    to two months imprisonment (time served) on the breach of recognizance charge
    and three years incarceration on the sexual assault as a party offence.  The
    appellant appeals against his conviction for sexual assault as a party to
    the offence and seeks leave to appeal his sentence of three years incarceration.</p>

  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    our view, of the various grounds of appeal raised by the appellant in support
    of his conviction appeal, it is necessary to address only the appellants
    arguments that the trial judge erred by failing to caution the jury concerning
    the frailties of the complainants evidence and by failing to provide a balanced
    jury charge.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    trial, the appellant admitted some of the sexual acts alleged by the complainant.  However,
    he maintained that she had consented to the sexual activity at issue.  Indeed,
    he claimed that the conduct at issue had been initiated by the complainant
    through her aggressive sexual behaviour toward the appellant and his friends.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crowns case against the appellant hinged on the complainants evidence.   Although
    there was evidence at trial of allegedly incriminatory statements made by
    the appellant to one of his friends on the day after the incidents in question,
    the conviction of the appellant on the charge of sexual assault as a party
    to the offence was impossible without the acceptance by the jury of the complainants
    evidence</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    case therefore turned on credibility.  Thus, any grounds for impeachment
    of the complainants credibility were of critical importance to the defence.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    were significant weaknesses in the complainants credibility.  In particular,
    the complainant gave two statements to the police in which she described
    her allegations of sexual impropriety against the appellant and A.B.  On
    both occasions, the complainant lied to the police.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    her first statement, the complainant knowingly implicated A.K., a second
    friend of the appellant who had also been present on the day in question,
    in an allegation of non-consensual sex that she knew to be untrue.  As the
    complainant later admitted, A.K. in fact was innocent of the offence alleged.  The
    complainant did nothing to correct the false information that she had provided
    to the police about A.K. until she was questioned further by them as part
    of their on-going investigation into her allegations.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    complainant also lied a second time in her first statement to the police.  In
    that statement, she provided an elaborate  and wholly concocted  account
    of a particular incident of gang rape by the appellant, A.B. and A.K. that
    she later acknowledged was untrue.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    in both of her lengthy statements to the police, the complainant failed to
    disclose an alleged incident of non-consensual anal sex with the appellant,
    despite assuring the police that she had relayed all relevant information
    to them, until virtually the close of her second statement.  This belatedly-disclosed
    incident formed the basis of the sexual assault charge against the appellant,
    of which he was eventually acquitted by the jury.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    these circumstances, given the centrality of the complainants evidence to
    the Crowns case and the highly material inconsistencies between the complainants
    trial testimony and her statements to the police, it was incumbent on the
    trial judge to warn the jury to exercise caution in basing a conviction on
    the strength of the complainants testimony.  At the very least, the trial
    judge was obliged to instruct the jury about the legal implications of the
    inconsistencies in the complainants various versions of events for the assessment
    of her credibility.  Apart from one cursory reference in the jury charge
    to one of the complainants admitted lies when outlining the position of
    the defence to the jury, the trial judge failed to provide this critical
    caution to the jury in any meaningful way.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>During
    oral argument before this court, Crown counsel responsibly conceded that
    the inconsistencies between the complainants trial testimony and her statements
    to the police should have been clarified
    by the trial judge.  However, she argued that the jury clearly knew that
    the complainant had lied in her statements to the police and that the jury
    charge was adequate to ensure that the jury knew of the need to address the
    weaknesses in the complainants evidence.  We disagree.</p>

    accept, on this record, that the jury was aware of the fact of the complainants
    lies and of the defence position that her evidence was unreliable and a fabrication.  This
    was made clear in defence counsels cross-examination of the complainant
    and in counsels closing submissions at trial.  </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>But
    at no point in his charge or his brief recharge did the trial judge alert
    the jury to the legal implications of the inconsistencies in the complainants
    evidence, including her admitted lies to the police, and of the need to carefully
    assess those inconsistencies when determining her credibility and the appellants
    culpability.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

    the circumstances of this case, this omission was reversible error.  Despite
    defence requests therefor, nothing in this jury charge or in the trial judges
    recharge focused the jurys attention on the admitted deficiencies in the
    complainants evidence, the potential untrustworthiness of her testimony,
    and the risks of grounding a conviction thereon.  For example, although defence
    counsel requested a corrective instruction to the jury to provide the same
    clarity regarding the inconsistencies in the complainants evidence as the
    trial judge had provided in his charge concerning the alleged inconsistencies
    in the appellants evidence and to outline the implications of [the complainants]
    lies to the policein terms of her credibility, the trial judge said only
    this in his recharge:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>As to the statements of both [the complainant and
    the appellant], obviously [<i>sic</i>] told the police lies at some point
    in their statements, and you know all about that, so I wont go into that.  So
    I wont have you back.  Thats it.  Youre on your own.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    prejudice to the defence arising from this error was compounded by the trial
    judges treatment of the evidence of A.B. in his jury charge.  At trial,
    the defence called A.B. to corroborate certain aspects of the appellants
    version of events.  Importantly, A.B.s testimony supported the appellants
    evidence that the complainant had consented to the sexual activity in question
    and, as well, on the issue whether the complainant had been the sexual aggressor
    in her interactions with the appellant and his companions.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Yet
    the trial judges references to A.B.s evidence in the jury charge focused
    exclusively on discrepancies between A.B.s testimony and that of the appellant.  Moreover,
    when defence counsel specifically objected to the trial judges treatment
    of A.B.s evidence in the jury charge, and requested the trial judge to point
    out the consistencies between A.B.s evidence and that of the appellant to
    the jury, the trial judge failed to do so.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Notwithstanding
    what arguably was a strong case for the Crown, trial fairness was fatally
    compromised as a result of the combined effect of the errors that we have
    described.  The jury charge, read as a whole, unduly promoted the Crowns
    case and effectively ignored or underplayed significant elements of the case
    for the defence.  Accordingly, the appellants conviction on the charge of
    sexual assault as a party to the offence cannot stand and a new trial is
    required.</p>
