  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants sued for damages arising from the death of their infant son alleging
    medical malpractice.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant father sued as personal representative of his deceased infant son
    for damages pursuant to the provisions of the <i>Trustee Act</i> R.S.O. 1990,
    c. T.23 on behalf of the estate and in his personal capacity for damages
    pursuant to the provisions of the <i>Family Law Act</i> R.S.O. 1990, c. F.3
    for derivative claims.  The appellant mother also sued for her derivative
    claims pursuant to the
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <i>FLA</i> provisions.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    their statement of claim, the appellant father on behalf of his deceased
    son’s estate claimed:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a)       General Damages in the amount of $10,000</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(b)       Special damages in the amount of $10,000</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both  appellants,
    father and mother, in their personal capacities  claimed:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(a)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>General
    damages in the amount of $100,000 each pursuant to the provision of the <i>Family
    Law Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. F. 3 as amended</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial of their action proceeded at
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    London,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario before Kennedy J., and in  reasons released January 3, 2007, their
    action was dismissed.  The trial judge assessed damages under the <i>Trustee
    Act</i> at $5000.00 and under the <i>Family Law Act</i> at $15,000.00 each
    to the mother and father for a total of $35,000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants appealed to the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court taking issue both with the dismissal of the action and the
    assessment of damages.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal was argued before the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court on November 18 and 19, 2008.  After argument on the appeal
    had been completed but before judgment thereon was released, the court had
    concern about its jurisdiction to hear the appeal and sought submissions
    from counsel.  Following receipt of those submissions, the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court concluded that because the total amount assessed by the
    trial judge was $35,000, it was without jurisdiction and transferred the
    within appeal to this court by order dated March 18, 2009.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thereafter
    the appellants moved before this court, <i>inter alia</i>, for:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(c)       if necessary, an Order quashing the appeal
    herein and       transferring the appeal back to the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court;</p>
  <h3>ISSUE</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants’ position is that for the purpose of determining jurisdiction,
    the claims of each separate plaintiff are to be considered separately. In
    this case,  because the amount assessed by the trial judge in respect of
    each plaintiff was under $25,000, the appeal lies properly to the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court.</p>
  <h3>ANALYSIS</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Both
    this court and the Divisional Court are statutory courts which find their
    jurisdiction in their constating statute – <i>The Courts of Justice Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c. 43 (the <i>Act</i>).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Notice of Appeal was filed February 1, 2007, prior to the coming into force
    of amendments to the <i>Act</i> which raised the monetary jurisdiction of
    the
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    jurisdiction of the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court is found in  s. 19 of the <i>Act</i>:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>19(1)  An appeal lies to the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court from,</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(a) a final order of a judge of the Superior
    Court of Justice as described in subsections (1.1) and (1.2);</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(1.1) If
    the notice of appeal is filed before the day section 3 of Schedule A to the
    Access of <i>Justice Act</i>; 2006 comes into force, clause (1)(a) applies
    in respect of a final order,</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote> (a) for a single payment of not more than
    $25,000 exclusive of costs;</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(b) the
    periodic payments that amount to not more than $25,000, exclusive of costs,
    in the 12 months commencing on the date the first payment is due under the
    order;</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(c) dismissing a claim for an amount that is
    not more than the amount set out in clause (a) or (b); or</p>
  <p class=Double-indent-subquote>(d) dismissing a claim for an amount that is
    more than the amount set out in clause (a) or (b) and in respect of which
    the judge or jury indicates that if the claim had been allowed the amount
    awarded would have been not more than the amount set out in clauses (a) or
    (b).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
    of the timing of the Notice of Appeal, if the
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court is to have jurisdiction it must be found within section
    19(1)(a)(1.1).  The judgment which is the subject of the within appeal merely
    provides that the action is dismissed with costs, if demanded. Neither subparagraphs
    (a) nor (b) applies because the judgment did not order payment of any money
    sum.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Similarly
    subparagraph (c) does not apply because the judgment did not dismiss claims<a href="#_ftn1"
name="_ftnref1" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[1]</span></span></span></a> for an amount that was not more than the amounts
    set out in subparagraphs (a) or (b) i.e., $25,000.00.  The judgment dismissed
    claims which totalled $120,000.00.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    subparagraph (d) cannot apply.  While the dismissed claims were for an amount
    more than the amounts set out in (a) or (b) as required by the first part
    of ss. (d), the judge’s assessment of the claims here, is for a total  amount
    which exceeds $25,000, namely $35,000.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All
    of the plaintiffs’ claims that are the subject of the dismissal must be added
    together to determine the total assessed amount of the dismissed claim for
    the purpose of applying ss. 19(1)(a)(1.1)(c) or 19(1)(a)(1.1.)(d). This rule
    applies not only to individualized claims by a single plaintiff for different
    heads of damages, but to the claims of the separate plaintiffs in one action.
    Once the amount of either the judgment, or where the claims were dismissed,
    the dismissed claims, and the amount assessed by the trial judge, is determined,
    then reference is made to section 19(1)(a) to determine if jurisdiction lies
    with the Divisional Court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    say, with respect to the Divisional Court, the decisions of this court in <i>McManus
    v. Feldman Investments Ltd.</i>, [2003] O.J. No. 5762 and <i>Sepe v. Monteleone</i> (2006),
    78 O.R. (3d) 676 are consistent with each other and with these reasons.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>McManus</i>,
    the total amount of the judgment was $148,143 in favour of the plaintiff.  Of
    that sum, the appeal was only in relation to the punitive damages which were
    assessed at $16,750.00.  However, the appeal lay to this court because the
    amount of the judgment was  in excess of $25,000. In <i>McManus</i>, the
    court quoted from the decision of Catzman J.A. in <i>McGrath v. Woodrow</i> (2001)
    52 O.R. (3d) 732 where he explained:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The pivotal concept in subclause 19(1)(a)(i) is
    the amount of the judgment. It is not the amount claimed in the action or
    counterclaim. It is not the amount “involved” in the appeal or “in issue” in
    the appeal. Jurisdiction under subclause 19(1)(a)(i) turns on the amount
    of the payment ordered by the judgment sought to be appealed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Sepe</i>,
    the plaintiff bricklayer sued for the sum of $18,000.00 for brickwork he
    had completed for the defendant homeowners.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    homeowners counterclaimed for damages in the sum of $20,000 for shoddy work
    and in addition claimed the sum of $3387.49 by way of set-off.  The homeowners
    conceded the value of the plaintiff’s work to be $12,146.06.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge dismissed both the appellant plaintiff’s claim and the homeowners’ claim
    for set-off. She awarded the homeowners $19,260 on their counterclaim. The
    appellant plaintiff appealed the dismissal of his claim and the award of
    judgment on the defendant respondents’
    counterclaim.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>To
    determine jurisdiction, again reference was to s. 19(1)(a)(1.1) of the <i>Act</i>.  As
    this court explained in <i>Sepe</i>, because the four subparagraphs that
    deal with jurisdiction are disjunctive each subparagraph is considered separately
    for the purpose of determining jurisdiction. The dismissal of the appellant
    Sepe’s claim fell within 19(1)(a)(1.1)(c) – dismissal of a claim that is
    for an amount not more than $25,000.00; he had claimed $18,000.00.  As for
    the counterclaim of the respondent defendants, the trial judge had awarded
    the sum of $19,260.00 – again a judgment sum for an amount less than $25,000.00,
    under 19(1)(a)(1.1)(a).  Accordingly there was no amount over $25,000.00
    and the appeal lay to the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court.<a href="#_ftn2"
name="_ftnref2" title=""><span class=MsoFootnoteReference><span
class=MsoFootnoteReference><span style='font-size:13.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;
'>[2]</span></span></span></a></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    judgment records the claims allowed and the claims that have been dismissed
    and is the key document to which reference must be made in determining the
    applicability or not of s. 19 of the <i>Act</i>. The subsections of s. 19
    are, as this court noted in <i>Sepe</i>, disjunctive and they must be read
    and interpreted in that way. However, within each subsection, all of the
    claims whether allowed or dismissed and whether claimed by one party or more
    than one party are to be added together in order to apply s. 19(1)(a). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, applying ss. (1.1)(d), one looks at the total amount assessed
    by the trial judge for all parties. That amount is $35,000, and therefore
    beyond the jurisdiction of the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court.</p>
  <h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons I conclude the appeal properly lies to this court and the motion
    to quash is dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>While
    the point raised is not an entirely novel one, nevertheless there remains
    , it appears, some confusion over the applicability of s. 19 of the Act and,
    in the circumstances, I agree with Mr. Hamer’s proposal that there be no
    costs.</p>
