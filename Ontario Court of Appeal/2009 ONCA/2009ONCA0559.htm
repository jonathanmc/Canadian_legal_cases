  <h3>The Appeal</h3>

    was retained by
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City
 w:st="on">
    Hamilton to do some construction work on
    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    King Street.  The work involved removing the existing sidewalk and excavating
    a trench four to six feet deep on the southerly edge of the street alongside
    the storefronts.  Ms. Singer, who was 78 years old at the time, was walking
    along
    <st1:Street w:st="on">

    King Street intending to go to The Bargain! Shop.  She entered the construction

    appellants, Hamilton and Dufferin, submit that the trial judge erred by finding
    that Ms. Singer’s injury was caused by their negligence.  They also submit
    that the trial judge erred by failing to find that Ms. Singer voluntarily
    assumed the risk under s. 4(1) of the <i>Occupiers’
    Liability Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. O.2, or was contributorily negligent and
    should therefore be found partially or completely at fault for the accident.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    begin by considering the standard of appellate review in negligence cases.  </p>
  <h3>Standard of Appellate Review</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    most frequently cited authority on the standard of appellate review,<i> Housen
    v. Nikolaisen</i>, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235, was a negligence case.  In <i>Housen, </i>the
    plaintiff, who was a passenger in a car that had failed to negotiate a sharp
    turn, suffered injuries when the car went off a rural road.  The driver had
    been drinking heavily.  The trial judge found that the plaintiff was 15 percent
    contributorily negligent in failing to take reasonable precautions for his
    own safety in accepting a ride from the driver.  He apportioned the remaining
    joint and several liability 50 percent to the driver and 35 percent to the
    municipality on the basis that the municipality was negligent in failing
    to post warning signs on the road.  The Saskatchewan Court of Appeal overturned
    the trial judge’s finding of negligence against the municipality.  The Supreme
    Court restored the trial judge’s decision and emphasized the limited scope
    of appellate review.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    its reasons, the Supreme Court stated the general principles that questions
    of fact are reviewed on the standard of palpable and overriding error, questions
    of law are reviewed on the standard of correctness, and a trial judge’s finding
    on a question of mixed fact and law is entitled to deference.  The authors
    of the majority judgment, Iacobucci and Major JJ., commented particularly
    on the standard of review in negligence cases.  At para. 29, they said that “[w]hen
    the question of mixed fact and law at issue is a finding of negligence, this
    Court has held that a finding of negligence by the trial judge should be
    deferred to by appellate courts.”  At para. 30, they said “[t]his more stringent
    standard of review for findings of negligence is appropriate, given that
    findings of negligence at the trial level can also be made by juries.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Iacobucci
    and Major JJ. pointed out that the policy reasons for deference were not
    only limited to the superior vantage point of the trial judge seeing and
    hearing the witnesses, but also served to limit the cost of litigation and
    to promote the autonomy of trial proceedings.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Supreme Court revisited the standard of appellate review in <i>H.L. v.
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">Canada</st1:country-region>
    (Attorney General), </i>[2005] 1 S.C.R. 401.  The court again emphasized
    that appellate courts do not “rehear” or “retry” cases.  Rather, they review
    for error.  Appellate courts should not interfere merely because they would
    have reached a different result.  They may only interfere if the trial judge
    made a finding that is unsupported by the evidence or that is unreasonable
    and would have affected the result.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    this standard of review in mind, I turn to the trial judge’s findings of
    fact that the appellants challenge explicitly or implicitly. </p>
  <h3>Findings of Fact</h3>
  <h3>i)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>No
    Warning Sign</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found there was no sign to warn Ms. Singer of the construction
    site.  The trial judge noted that the appellants had led evidence of a sign
    placed at the corner of King and Catherine Streets advising pedestrians to
    use the north sidewalk.  However, after observing that such a sign did not
    appear anywhere in the photos entered as exhibits, he found that in any event,
    a sign at that corner would not have provided a warning to Ms. Singer because
    she approached the construction site from the intersection of King and Mary
    Streets, one block east of Catherine Street.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    finding of the trial judge is incontestable.  </p>
  <h3>ii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Lack
    of Barricades</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that the barricades at the site did not block pedestrians
    from entering the construction site. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Counsel
    for the appellants drew this court’s attention to the photographic exhibits
    showing the placement of barricades around the construction site.  As the
    trial judge noted, however, these photographs were taken after the barricades
    had been moved after the accident.  It is therefore necessary to consider
    the testimony of the witnesses regarding the barricades.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge accepted the testimony of an independent witness, Scott Taylor,
    the manager of The Bargain! Shop, who testified that the first, most southerly
    barricade was placed some four to five feet away from the front of the shop.  In
    doing so, the trial judge rejected the contrary evidence of the defence witnesses
    as to the location of the barricades.  There is no basis upon which this
    court could interfere with the trial judge’s decision to prefer the evidence
    of Mr. Scott.  His testimony makes clear, as the trial judge found, that
    there was a significant gap, of approximately four to five feet, between
    the barricade and the storefront for a pedestrian to walk along what appeared “to
    be part the sidewalk” but was in fact the construction zone.  The trial judge
    went on the find that when Ms. Singer approached the construction zone, “there
    was nothing there to guide her in a clear and positive manner, by adequate
    signs, markers, pavement markings or by traffic control persons.” </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>There
    is no basis upon which this court could interfere with these findings.  The
    appellants’
    contention that “[t]he last barricade was approximately 18 inches to 24 inches
    from the face of the building...” must be rejected.</p>
  <h3>iii)<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Visual
    cues</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge considered the appellants’ argument that there were many visual
    cues that should have alerted Ms. Singer to the risk of danger.  At trial,
    the appellants had argued Ms. Singer should have seen the orange barricades,
    the “tiger barrels”, an operating mini-excavator, a rubber-tired backhoe
    and a dump truck.  They submitted that the presence of these should have
    made it apparent to Ms. Singer she should stay out of the area.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge found that although there were visual cues of construction, those
    visual cues did not alert Ms. Singer to the hidden danger of the trench.  He
    said “there was nothing to bar her from walking along what appeared to be
    a sidewalk.  These were not cues of the hidden danger of the four-foot trench
    into which [Ms. Singer] fell as she progressed along her way.”</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    appeal, the appellants argued strenuously that Ms. Singer should have seen
    the equipment operating and should have avoided going near it.  However,
    this court cannot revisit the trial judge’s finding that after passing through
    the four to five foot space between the barricade and the storefront, Ms.
    Singer would have been well into the construction area by the time she saw
    the trench.  He said that Ms. Singer “would not have seen the four foot trench
    until she got very close to the mini-excavator which was obstructing her
    view.  At that point it was too late...”. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>All
    of these findings were strengthened by other findings of fact that the trial
    judge made.  For instance, the trial judge found that there was no one on
    site to direct pedestrian traffic; the work site was disorderly, substandard,
    and hazardous from a pedestrian safety perspective; no one involved in the
    project had any more than a passing familiarity with the purpose, fundamental
    principles or standards directed towards ensuring pedestrian safety in work
    zones; and there were at least four workers who ought to have seen Ms. Singer
    but failed to warn her.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>It
    is in the context of these factual findings that the question of negligence
    must be considered.</p>
  <h3>Finding of Negligence</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge’s factual findings, taken together, supported his conclusion
    that the appellants fell below the standard of care required by the<i> Occupier’s
    Liability Act</i> and the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices issued
    by the Ministry of Transportation.  The trial judge concluded by saying that
    the appellants</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>failed to take affirmative action to protect the
    safety of people, such as [Ms. Singer], from being injured because of a hidden
    danger, being the four foot trench.  They failed to take adequate measures
    to block [Ms. Singer] from entering into the construction site.  They failed
    to post signs in the area in question for [Ms. Singer] to use the north sidewalk.  They
    failed to post signs on the barricades warning of prohibited entry. They
    failed to post signs of danger in the area.  They failed to delineate a clear
    and positive pathway for her to get around the construction site.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Thus,
    the trial judge’s ultimate finding that the appellants’
    negligence directly caused Ms. Singer’s injuries is supported by the evidence,
    is reasonable, and demonstrates no error.  There is no basis to interfere
    with it.</p>
  <h3>Willing Assumption of Risk </h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants submitted that the trial judge erred in failing to find that s.
    4(1) of the<i> Occupiers' Liability Act</i> applied.  Section 4(1) provides
    :</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The duty of care provided for in subsection 3(1)
    does not apply in respect of risks willingly assumed by the person who enters
    on the premises, but in that case the occupier owes a duty to the person
    to not create a danger with the deliberate intent of doing harm or damage
    to the person or his or her property and to not act with reckless disregard
    of the presence of a person or his or her property.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants argued that the evidence was clear that Ms. Singer knew of the
    risk and they could only be found liable if they deliberately meant to cause
    her harm or acted in reckless disregard of her presence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>As
    already noted, the trial judge focused on the trench as the cause of Ms.
    Singer’s injuries.  He found that the existence of the trench was not obvious
    and that it was a hidden danger.  He held that Ms. Singer had to know the
    risk or appreciate that risk before she could willingly assume it within
    the meaning of s. 4(1).  Since she did not know of the existence of the trench,
    the provision did not apply.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[28]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Whether
    a person has willingly assumed a risk within the meaning of s. 4(1) of the<i> Occupiers'
    Liability Act</i> is a mixed question of fact and law.  This court must defer
    to the judge’s conclusions on this question, absent palpable and overriding
    error<i>.</i>  The trial judge’s reasoning that the risk that caused injury
    was the trench and that Ms. Singer did not willingly assume that risk since
    there was nothing to alert her to its existence is supported by the evidence
    and is reasonable.  There is no basis to interfere.  I would not give effect
    to this ground of appeal.  </p>
  <h3>Contributory negligence</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[29]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    above analysis also disposes of the appellants’
    submission that the trial judge erred by failing to find Ms. Singer contributorily
    negligent.  The appellants argued that by walking on the ledge next to the
    trench, Ms. Singer should have foreseen that she might injure herself.  On
    the findings of the trial judge, however, there was no warning or barricade
    to prevent Ms. Singer from entering a situation of danger.  He found that
    the lack of warning or barricade resulted in her “being led into direct conflicts
    with work site vehicles, equipment or operations”.  By the time she would
    have been aware of the trench “it was too late and she fell into the ditch,
    fracturing her right leg”.  That Ms. Singer was wearing high heels, a fact
    the appellants emphasized, does not undermine the findings of the trial judge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>This
    analysis was supported by the evidence and was reasonable.  There is no basis
    upon which this court can interfere.  I would not give effect to this ground
    of appeal.</p>
  <h3>Damages</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[31]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge assessed Ms. Singer’s non-pecuniary damages at $65,000 for physical
    injuries and $45,000 for psychological injuries flowing from a major depressive
    episode that flowed from the accident.  The appellants appeal from these
    assessments.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[32]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants have failed to establish, however, that the trial judge applied
    a wrong principle of law, considered some irrelevant factor, failed to consider
    some relevant factor, or awarded an amount so inordinately high that it must
    be seen as a wholly erroneous estimate of the damage.  There is no basis
    to interfere with the damages he assessed.</p>

  <h3>Cross-appeal</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Likewise,
    the members of Ms. Singer’s family failed to establish that in assessing
    their damages on the <i>Family Law Act</i> claims, the trial judge committed
    any error in principle, or that the damages are so inordinately low they
    cannot stand.  Accordingly, the cross-appeal must also be dismissed. </p>
  <h3>Conclusion</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    the above reasons, I would dismiss both the appeal and the cross-appeal.  Failing
    agreement, the parties may make written brief submissions on costs (no more
    than five pages), the respondents’ submissions to be filed within 15 days,
    and the appellants’ submissions within 15 days thereafter. </p>
