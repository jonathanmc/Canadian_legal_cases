  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants, Ainsley Anthony Drakes and Richard Brewster, were found guilty
    of several counts of fraud over $5000, one count of attempted fraud, and
    one count of laundering the proceeds of crime.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants were involved in a large scale, brazen and sophisticated fraud
    scheme.  The scheme involved asking the victims for advance payment of fees
    in order to secure the release of huge multi-million dollar sums from the
    Central Bank of
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Nigeria</st1:country-region>
    .  The fees were collected from the exceptionally gullible victims who, in
    turn, received nothing from the appellants.  The scheme was operated out
    of a “boiler room” in a condominium unit at 10 Dean Park in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Toronto.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    police obtained a warrant to search the condominium and recovered a great
    deal of documentation that deeply implicated the appellants in the fraud
    scheme.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the trial, the trial judge ruled that the search of the condominium was reasonable
    and did not violate s. 8 of the <i>Charter.  </i>Alternatively, she ruled
    that if the search were unreasonable, the evidence obtained pursuant to it
    should be admitted under s. 24(2) of the <i>Charter</i>.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the conclusion of the trial, the trial judge convicted Drakes of seven counts
    and Brewster of five counts in the indictment.  She sentenced Drakes to five
    years imprisonment and Brewster to four years imprisonment.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants appeal their convictions and sentences.</p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>Conviction appeals</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants’ principal argument is that the trial judge erred in her <i>Charter</i> s.
    8 ruling.  There are three components to their argument.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    the appellants contend that the trial judge erred by concluding that the
    information provided to the police by the property management personnel at
    the condominium complex was not information over which the appellants had
    a reasonable expectation of privacy.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    order to determine whether an individual has a reasonable expectation of
    privacy in particular information, a court must take a contextual approach
    and consider all the relevant circumstances, including
    “the nature of the information itself, the nature of the relationship between
    the party releasing the information and the party claiming its confidentiality,
    the place where the information was obtained, and the seriousness of the
    crime being investigated”: see <i>R. v. Plant</i> (1993), 84 C.C.C. (3d)
    203 (S.C.C.) at p. 212.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge properly instructed herself on the test from <i>Plant</i>.  She
    also considered all the relevant circumstances, did not misapprehend the
    evidence and, in our view, made a reasonable assessment of what weight to
    give the applicable factors.  To the extent that it could be said that the
    appellants had any reasonable expectation of privacy in the information at
    issue, it was a minimal interest at best.  Accordingly, there is no basis
    to intervene with respect to the trial judge’s ultimate conclusion on this
    issue.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    the appellants submit that the trial judge erred by concluding that s. 8
    of the <i>Charter</i> was not engaged when the police obtained information
    from the building superintendents relating to the contents of unit 216 in
    the condominium building.  They argue that this police conduct amounted to
    a seizure and that the building superintendents and/or the property managers
    who provided the information at issue to the police were
    ‘agents’ of the state.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    disagree.  The context surrounding this issue is the fact that the superintendents
    responded to a flood in unit 216 and then reported suspicious activity in
    the unit to the property managers who in turn furnished it to the police.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge noted, correctly, that s. 8 will be engaged only if there is
    state action.  The trial judge continued:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The reason for the search was the flood, something
    to which management and staff had an obligation to respond.  There is nothing
    in the evidence to suggest that management initiated the search or that it
    was conducted differently because of police intervention.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>. . .</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>It follows that the way in which the police had
    access to the information about certain items inside the unit was as a result
    of a normal response to the flood… Management then contacted the police,
    not as agents but as citizens reporting suspicious activity.  </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote align=center style='text-align:center'>. . .</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Since the process whereby information about what
    was in the unit involved no state action, the <i>Charter</i> was not engaged.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>We agree with this analysis and conclusion.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants argue that the trial judge erred by applying the wrong test for
    the determination of state action or agency.  They point to one part of the
    trial judge’s reasons where, arguably, she misstated this test as set out
    in <i>R. v. Broyles</i>, [1991] 3 S.C.R. 595 and <i>R. v. M. (M.R.)</i>,
    (1998) 129 C.C.C. (3d) 361 (S.C.C.).  However, at the beginning of her analysis
    concerning state action, the trial judge correctly stated the applicable
    test as to whether an individual is acting as an agent of the police.  When
    her reasons are read as a whole, we are satisfied that the trial judge understood
    the substance of the governing test and applied it properly.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    note that before the building superintendents entered the condominium unit
    in response to the flood, they did not know that the police were conducting
    an investigation or had any interest in unit 216.  They received no special
    instructions from building management with respect to their inspection of
    the unit, nor were they directed to deal with the police.  As a result, they
    did not enter the unit or conduct their inspection any differently than they
    otherwise would have because of any police intervention.  Similarly, when
    the property managers and staff re-entered unit 216 two days later, they
    did so for the purpose of checking the residue of the flood damage and, as
    one of the managers put it, “out of curiosity”.  Again, there is no evidence
    that they entered and inspected the unit at the behest of or for the benefit
    of the police or in response to a police request or demand.  In these circumstances,
    the trial judge was correct to conclude that the defence claims of state
    action had not been made out.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    also observe that in <i>R. v. Buhay</i> (2003), 174 C.C.C. (3d) 97 (S.C.C.),
    a unanimous court in a judgment authored by Arbour J. confirmed that in the
    absence of any agency issue, police can receive and act on information received
    from a third party and use the information to seek the issuance of a search
    warrant; this is precisely what happened in this case.  See also: <i>R. v.
    Wiley</i> (1993), 83 C.C.C. (3d) 1611 (S.C.C.).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    the appellants contend that the trial judge erred by concluding that they
    did not have a reasonable expectation of privacy with respect to their use
    of a spot in an underground parking garage in the condominium building.  The
    police used their knowledge of this information to obtain information about
    the unit occupied by the appellants in the building.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    disagree.  The trial judge referred to the “totality of circumstances” test
    formulated in <i>R. v. Edwards</i> (1996), 104 C.C.C. (3d) 136 (S.C.C.),
    at para. 45.  In our view, she correctly applied this test, noting that the
    appellants shared the parking garage with 440 other units, that they had
    limited control over it, and that management (who did have control over the
    garage) consented to the police gaining access to it for the purposes of
    their investigation.  See also: <i>R. v. Thomsen</i>, [2007] O.J. No. 4863
    (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ) and <i>R. v. Laurin</i> (1997), 113 C.C.C. (3d) 519 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>For
    these reasons, we would dismiss the appellants’
    principal ground of appeal.  It follows that the <i>Charter </i>s. 24(2)
    issue does not arise.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants also submit that the trial judge erred by using their silence
    as evidence to support the convictions.  They single out this passage in
    her reasons:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>I further note the defendants did not testify.  While
    this failure is not an independent piece of evidence, the absence of an explanation
    assists me in deciding which inferences to draw from the evidence.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    observe that this argument applies only to the trial judge’s reasons with
    respect to count 2 of the indictment.  The impugned comment, while ambiguous,
    is superfluous.  The evidence on this count was simply overwhelming.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Finally,
    the appellants contend that the verdicts on counts 4 and 5 – relating to
    unnamed victims – relied improperly on similar fact evidence from the other
    counts with respect to named victims.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not accept this ground of appeal.  These verdicts were overwhelmingly
    supported by the documentary evidence about the nature and extent of the
    fraud committed by the appellants with respect to the unnamed victims.</p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>Sentence appeals</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellants submit that the sentences imposed by the trial judge – five years
    for Drakes and four years for Brewster – were outside the range for similar
    offences and offenders.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    disagree.  The trial judge’s analysis of the factors relating to the fraudulent
    scheme and her consideration of the circumstances of the two offenders were
    consistent with the leading large scale fraud sentencing decisions of this
    court: see for example, <i>R. v. Dobis</i> (2002), 58 O.R. (3d) 536 and <i>R.
    v. Bogart</i> (2202), 61 O.R. (3d) 75.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[26]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    agree with and underline this passage from the trial judge’s reasons for
    sentence:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>There is a real need to emphasize denunciation
    and general deterrence in the realm of large-scale frauds with devastating
    consequences for their victims.  There is a real need to warn individuals
    currently involved in such scams, and those devising new ones, that substantial
    penitentiary sentences will follow this type of crime, to say nothing about
    the serious disgrace to them and everyone connected with them.</p>
  <h4><u><span lang=EN-US>Disposition</span></u></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[27]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    conviction and sentence appeals are dismissed.</p>
