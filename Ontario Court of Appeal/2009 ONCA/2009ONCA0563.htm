style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    June 14, 2005, at about 7:00 p.m. in the evening, Kevin McLeish (“McLeish”)
    was shot six times at point blank range in a parking lot in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Scarborough.  Remarkably, he survived the attack.  However, he sustained
    very serious injuries as a result of which he is now paralyzed from the waist
    down and confined to a wheelchair.  He also suffered wounds to both of his
    lungs, his spleen, his thighs, his penis and his scrotum.  He spent approximately
    one month at
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Sunnybrook
    <st1:PlaceType

    Hospital and several months thereafter in rehabilitation at Lyndhurst Rehabilitation
    Centre.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    July 5, 2005, about one week before he left
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:PlaceName w:st="on">
    Sunnybrook
    <st1:PlaceType
 w:st="on">
    Hospital, the police visited McLeish after receiving information from an
    unknown person that the appellant was involved in the shooting.  During this
    visit, McLeish identified the appellant as the shooter in the third of three
    photo line-ups shown to him by the police.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant was then arrested and charged with one count each of attempted
    murder, “using a firearm while committing an indictable offence”, pointing
    a firearm and breach of recognizance.  At the outset of trial, he pled guilty
    to the breach of recognizance charge.  On April 27, 2007, he was convicted
    by Nordheimer J. of the Superior Court of Justice on the attempted murder,
    pointing a firearm and breach of recognizance charges.  The trial judge quashed
    the remaining charge
    – “using a firearm while committing an indictable offence” – as a nullity.  On
    May 22, 2007, the appellant was sentenced to life imprisonment on the attempted
    murder charge; four years imprisonment, concurrent and after credit for pre-sentence
    custody, on the pointing a firearm charge; and time served, plus one day,
    on the breach of recognizance charge.  He appeals against his convictions
    and his sentence for attempted murder.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    focus of the appellant’s oral argument before this court in support of his
    conviction appeal concerned the trial judge’s assessment of the reliability
    and credibility of the identification witnesses.  The appellant argued that
    the trial judge erred in his use and appreciation of certain of the identification
    evidence, leading to an unreasonable verdict.  In respect of sentence, the
    appellant maintained that a sentence of life imprison-ment for attempted
    murder was harsh and excessive in the circumstances of this case.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Identification
    was the central issue at trial.  The Crown’s identification case rested on
    the evidence of the victim – McLeish – and an independent witness who observed
    the shooting – Tracey Hamilton (“
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Hamilton”).  The Crown also placed some reliance on evidence of the appellant’s
    unsuccessful post-incident attempt to flee
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    .  The appellant did not testify, nor was any other defence evidence called.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>During
    his testimony at trial, McLeish provided a description of the physical appearance
    of the shooter and identified the appellant as the perpetrator.  He said
    that he knew the appellant from the neighbourhood where they both lived and
    that he and the appellant saw each other on a fairly regular basis.  Indeed,
    McLeish testified that he and the appellant had both attended a barbecue
    and poker game at the home of a mutual acquaintance just a few weeks before
    the shooting.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown’s second identification witness, Tracey Hamilton, lived on the other
    side of the parking lot from where the shooting occurred.  On the night of
    the shooting, she gave a statement to the police in which she provided a
    physical description of the shooter.  She also told the police that the shooter
    resembled a rap singer by the name of Beanie Segal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    trial,
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Hamilton testified that on the day in question, she was at home caring for
    one of her children.  She witnessed the shooting from a short distance away – about
    16 feet.  The shooter was facing in her direction.  Although she did not
    see a gun, she saw a male with his arm outstretched a few inches from the
    chest of the victim, observed two sparks and heard four to six gunshots.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Hamilton also said that, shortly before the shooting, she observed two cars
    in the parking lot that she had never seen before.  She stated that she recognized
    the men who got out of one of the cars from the neighbourhood, including
    the appellant.  She had seen the appellant on at least two or three prior
    occasions in the complex where she lived.  She said that the appellant was
    part of a group of males that had tried to pick her up in the past.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span

    her testimony,
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place

    Hamilton again provided a description of the shooter and again said that
    he looked similar to a rap singer by the name of Beanie Segal.  A picture
    of Segal was made an exhibit at trial. 
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place

    Hamilton also identified the appellant in court as the shooter, as she had
    previously done at the appellant’s preliminary inquiry.</p>

    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Hamilton was not presented with a photo line-up by the police during their
    investigation.  However, she testified that some weeks after the shooting,
    her boyfriend had showed her a newspaper article related to the shooting
    that included a picture of the appellant.</p>
  <h2>(2)       Appellant’s Complaints Concerning</h2>
  <h2>                        Identification Evidence</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    trial, the appellant did not contest that he and McLeish had known each other
    for several years prior to the shooting.  However, among other matters, he
    argued that McLeish’s identification of him was unreliable because McLeish
    committed perjury about the number of males present at the site of the shooting
    in order to protect their identities.  According to the appellant, this allegedly
    demonstrated a motive by McLeish to falsely implicate the appellant as the
    perpetrator.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge held that the evidence at trial displaced any concerns about
    the reliability of McLeish’s identification of the appellant as the shooter.  The
    appellant does not challenge this finding on appeal.  Nor does he contest
    the trial judge’s rejection of the defence theory that McLeish mistakenly
    identified the appellant as his assailant.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>However,
    the appellant argues that the trial judge erred by concluding that McLeish
    had not falsely identified the appellant as the shooter.  In particular,
    the appellant submits that the trial judge erred by relying on
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Hamilton’s evidence, which the appellant says was itself inherently unreliable,
    to corroborate McLeish’s claim that the appellant was the shooter.  In so
    doing, the appellant contends, the trial judge erred: (i) by treating this
    case as a recognition case; (ii) by relying on Hamilton’s reference to the
    appellant’s resemblance to the rapper Beanie Segal when that reference did
    not raise her description of the shooter “from the generic to the specific” and
    did not render it “more probative”; (iii) by observing that there was a “marked
    resemblance” between the picture of Beanie Segal and the appellant, without
    describing any points of comparison; (iv) by failing to take account of the
    discrepancies between McLeish and Hamilton’s descriptions of the shooter;
    (v) by relying on Hamilton’s certainty of her identification of the appellant
    to assess her reliability; and (vi) by failing to appreciate that the error
    of false identification was heightened by relying, in combination, on McLeish’s
    evidence and Hamilton’s certainty about her identification of the appellant.</p>
  <h2>(3)       Discussion</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    reject these arguments for the following reasons.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    the trial judge began his analysis of the evidence by adverting to the well-established
    dangers of identification evidence and to some of the leading authorities
    in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    on that issue.  He noted, correctly, that the weight to be assigned to identification
    evidence varies with the circumstances of the case: see <i>R. v. Miaponoose</i> (1996),
    110 C.C.C. (3d) 445 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), at p. 452; <i>R. v. Smierciak</i> (1946), 87 C.C.C. 175 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge went on to emphasize that this was a recognition case, not simply
    a case of an identification of the shooter by McLeish.  We agree with that
    characterization and with the trial judge’s comment that: “[t]his was not
    a situation of a fleeting glance or a split second observation.”  The appellant
    was not a stranger to McLeish.  On the contrary, McLeish had known the appellant
    for several years.  He spoke to him before he was shot, in unobstructed circumstances
    and daylight conditions, when the two men were standing face to face.  McLeish
    recognized the appellant as the shooter. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    it was McLeish’s unchallenged evidence that there was no history of antagonism
    or conflict between him and the appellant prior to the shooting.  The record
    suggests that the shooting was sudden, unprovoked and unpredictable.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant points out that the trial judge did not accept McLeish’s assertion
    that only the appellant and one companion were present when McLeish was in
    the parking lot.  The finding that McLeish had ‘lied’ on this issue, the
    appellant claims, demonstrates that he had a motive to falsely identify the
    appellant.  We disagree.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge held, as he was entitled to do on this record, that McLeish’s
    false assertion about the number of males present in the parking lot was
    prompted by his desire to protect others from any involvement with the police
    in a community where the evidence indicated that considerable hostility to
    the police existed.  Contrary to the appellant’s submission, a desire not
    to involve others in a police investigation does not establish animus by
    McLeish towards the appellant or a motive to falsely implicate the appellant
    in a serious crime.  Indeed, it suggests precisely the opposite.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Third,
    we do not accept the appellant’s contention that the trial judge’s assessment
    of
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Hamilton’s evidence was flawed or that the trial judge erred by relying on
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Hamilton’s identification evidence to support his conclusion that McLeish
    did not falsely identify the appellant as his attacker.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    with McLeish’s evidence, the trial judge identified and addressed the problems
    in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Hamilton’s identification evidence, including the defence criticisms of that
    evidence, many of which the appellant renews before this court.  And as with
    McLeish’s evidence, the trial judge provided detailed and cogent reasons
    for his rejection of the multi-faceted defence attack on
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Hamilton’s evidence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial judge recognized the frailties of in-dock identification evidence and,
    as a result, did not rely on that evidence by
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Hamilton to establish the appellant’s guilt.  Instead, he relied on her evidence “as
    providing some corroboration of, and support for, Mr. McLeish’s identification” of
    the appellant and as undercutting the defence claim of fabricated identification
    by McLeish.</p>

    our opinion, the trial judge did not err in relying on
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Hamilton’s evidence for this purpose. 
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Hamilton testified that she knew the appellant from the neighbourhood where
    she lived.  Although she did not remember full particulars of her prior encounters
    with the appellant, she linked her recognition of him to occasions when the
    appellant and several others had tried to ‘hit’ on her.  Thus, this was not
    a case of eyewitness identification of a complete stranger. 
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Hamilton, like McLeish, recognized the appellant as the shooter.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Moreover,
    prior to viewing the newspaper article that contained a picture of the appellant,
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Hamilton had provided a description of the shooter that matched the appellant
    and noted the shooter’s resemblance to the rapper Beanie Segal.  The latter
    reference point narrowed her more general description of the shooter to a
    resemblance to a specific type of look.  Her evidence of the appellant’s
    resemblance to Beanie Segal was supported by her prior knowledge of the appellant
    and was entitled to some weight. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Based
    on
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Hamilton’s evidence, it was unobjectionable for the trial judge to compare
    the picture of Beanie Segal to the appellant’s appearance and to find a “marked” resemblance
    between the two: see <i>R. v. Rybak</i> (2008), 233 C.C.C. (3d) 58 (Ont.
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), at para. 121; <i>R. v. Nikolvoski</i> (1996), 111 C.C.C. (3d) 403 (S.C.C.).  The
    trial judge was not obliged to detail in his reasons those points of comparison
    that he noted between Segal’s picture and the appellant’s appearance.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[27]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the end, in our view, the trial judge’s assessment of the identification
    evidence in this case was exemplary.  His reasons reveal that he was sensitive
    to the issues surrounding the identification evidence, that he dealt with
    those issues in accordance with the applicable legal principles, and that
    he did not misapprehend the nature of that evidence or ignore its weaknesses.  His
    findings regarding the identification evidence therefore attract deference
    from this court.  We have no hesitation in concluding that there was ample
    evidential support on this record for the identification of the appellant
    as the person who shot McLeish.</p>

  <h2>III.       Sentence Appeal</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[29]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant argues that the trial judge erred by imposing a life sentence for
    attempted murder that was harsh and excessive in all the circumstances.  He
    asserts that when fashioning his sentence, the trial judge erred: (i) by
    failing to consider and give sufficient weight to factors warranting mitigation
    of the appellant’s sentence; and (ii) by failing to impose a sentence that
    was proportionate and the least restrictive sanction appropriate on the facts
    of this case.  We reject these submissions.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[30]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    our view, the trial judge did not err in his approach to sentencing or in
    respect of the sentence imposed.  The appellant does not challenge the consideration
    given by the trial judge to the many aggravating features of this case.  In
    respect of mitigation, the trial judge recognized that the appellant was
    a first offender and the father of a young child.  He took these factors
    into account in crafting his sentence, together with the appellant’s prospects
    for reoffending.  There was no evidence before the trial judge that the appellant
    had any real rehabilitative potential apart from that arising by necessary
    implication from his youth.  The trial judge did not fail to consider any
    significant mitigating factor.  We note that the fresh evidence filed by
    the appellant details his academic progress and his course of conduct in
    custody.  While some of the fresh evidence suggests a good prospect for the
    rehabilitation of the appellant, other parts of the fresh evidence do not.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[31]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    also reject the claims that the life sentence imposed was disproportionate
    to the circumstances of this offence or harsh and excessive.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[32]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    was a grave crime that almost occasioned the loss of a life.  Although he
    survived this vicious attack, the victim’s life has been altered forever – he
    is confined to a wheelchair and is paralyzed from the waist down.  We agree
    with the trial judge that: “[t]his was a cold-blooded and senseless shooting.”  As
    we have said, the attack was unprovoked.  The appellant shot the victim six
    times at point blank range.  He fired one shot in the victim’s chest, one
    in his groin area and four in his back.  There was no evidence before the
    trial judge to explain the appellant’s actions.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[33]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    we reject the appellant’s claim that the sentence imposed was outside the
    applicable range of sentence for similar offences and offenders.  The attempted
    murder in this case involved the use of a gun without warning in a public
    place where other citizens, including children, were present and at potential
    risk, in apparent retaliation for some minor slight.  As this court has repeatedly
    said, the use of guns in public places in
    <st1:City
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Toronto cries out for lengthy sentences.  The trial judge took the serious
    concern of growing gun violence in
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    <st1:place
 w:st="on">
    Toronto into account.  This was a proper and necessary consideration.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[34]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    our opinion, the sentence imposed was fit and the trial judge did not err
    in his sentencing analysis.  It follows that while we grant leave to appeal
    sentence, the sentence appeal is dismissed. </p>
