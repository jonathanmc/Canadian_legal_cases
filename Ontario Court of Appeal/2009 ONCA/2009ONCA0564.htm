    appellant was convicted of three offences, trafficking in a substance held
    out to be cocaine, possessing a loaded restricted firearm, and being present
    in a motor vehicle with a firearm.  He appeals his convictions on the two
    firearms offences.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>An
    undercover police officer posing as a drug buyer arranged to meet Keith Meredith
    to purchase 2 kilograms of cocaine for about $70,000.  When the two met,
    the officer showed Meredith the money.  Meredith left his car and met the
    appellant and Dwayne Hall.  After the three men had a conversation, they
    walked together to the car and got in.  The appellant was carrying a bag
    of fake cocaine.  Hall had a gun in his belt.  Before the deal was completed,
    the undercover officer signalled other officers in the area who arrested
    the three men.  The trial judge found that the three men had formed an intention
    in common to rob the officer of the $70,000.  Relying upon s. 21(2) of the <i>Criminal
    Code</i>, she went on to conclude that the appellant was a party to the firearm
    offences because he knew or ought to have known that one of the three would
    have a gun.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant argues that the trial judge erred in finding that the appellant
    had formed a common intention with the others to rob the officer.  We do
    not accept this argument.  The actions of the three men throughout the incident,
    including their comments in the presence of the officer and the way the three
    positioned themselves in the car, were consistent with the conclusion that
    they were assisting each other in preparing to rob the officer.  Moreover,
    the fake cocaine that the appellant carried to the car was very obviously
    fake.  It was a worthless bag of plaster with bits of twigs mixed in.  The
    three men believed they were dealing with a high level drug dealer.  As the
    trial judge pointed out, it stretches credulity to suggest that once the
    dealer had looked into the bag, he would willingly, without a struggle, pass
    over $70,000.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    agree with the trial judge that “the inescapable conclusion is that [the
    three men] intended to rob the undercover officer”
    and that they knew they would need to use force or violence to effect this
    end.  Thus, we see no basis to interfere with the trial judge’s finding that
    the appellant was guilty of the two firearm offences.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant also argues that the two convictions for firearm offences cannot
    stand in view of the principle in <i>R. v. Kienapple</i>.  This argument
    was not raised before the trial judge.  Nonetheless, in light of the fact
    that the appellant was found guilty of the firearm offences by virtue of
    being a party to a common intention to rob under s. 21(2) of the <i>Code</i>,
    we are of the view that one of the charges ought to be stayed.  Accordingly,
    the conviction on the charge pursuant to s. 94(1) of the <i>Criminal Code</i>,
    the less serious charge, is set aside and that charge is stayed. </p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appeal is dismissed with respect to the other firearm offence. </p>
