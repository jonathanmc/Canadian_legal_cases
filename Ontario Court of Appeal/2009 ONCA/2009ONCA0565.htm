  <h2>(1)       Introduction</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    is the fifth application before this court by the moving party, Karlheinz
    Schreiber, for relief styled in the nature of judicial review of a “decision” by
    the Minister of Justice (the “Minister”) concerning an order to surrender
    Mr. Schreiber to the Federal Republic of Germany signed by the Minister on
    October 31, 2004.  In this instance, by notice of application filed on June
    2, 2009, Mr. Schreiber applies under s. 57 of the <i>Extradition Act</i>,
    S.C. 1999, c. 18 for relief in respect of the surrender order.  Each of his
    four earlier applications for judicial review was dismissed by this court.  Leave
    to appeal to the Supreme Court of Canada in respect of those dismissals was
    ultimately denied.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    background to Mr. Schreiber’s current application is straightforward.  On
    October 17, 2008 and again on April 20, 2009, Mr. Schreiber made further
    submissions to the Minister concerning the surrender order.  Mr. Schreiber’s
    counsel followed-up on those submissions in subsequent correspondence to
    the Minister dated May 14, 2009 and May 25, 2009.  Receipt of those communications
    was acknowledged on behalf of the Minister.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Against
    this backdrop, Mr. Schreiber’s application has two components.  First, he
    argues that the Minister has failed to respond to the submissions made on
    April 20, 2009 and that his failure to do so, viewed in the context of the
    Minister’s alleged earlier actions in October 2007 involving an attempt to
    remove Mr. Schreiber from Canada, establish that the Minister “has no intention
    of considering [Mr. Schreiber’s] further submissions”.  This, Mr. Schreiber
    says, constitutes a violation of his right under s. 7 of the <i>Canadian
    Charter of Rights and Freedoms</i> to security of the person.  Alternatively,
    Mr. Schreiber contends that the Minister’s actions provide a clear indication
    that the Minister has already rejected Mr. Schreiber’s further submissions
    and that he “has no intention of informing [Mr. Schreiber] of this before
    removing him from
    <st1:country-region
w:st="on">
      <st1:place w:st="on">
      Canada</st1:country-region>
    ”.  In these circumstances, Mr. Schreiber maintains that this court should
    direct the Minister “to properly consider [his] submissions in accordance
    with the Minister’s obligations under the <i>Extradition Act</i> and the <i>Charter</i>”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    argued before us, the second component of Mr. Schreiber’s application involves
    a request for interim relief of short duration
    – 48 hours – concerning the surrender order.  Given the background to this
    matter, above-outlined, Mr. Schreiber argues that if this court concludes
    that the Minister is still considering Mr. Schreiber’s further submissions,
    an order should issue that Mr. Schreiber not be surrendered for at least
    48 hours following his receipt of the Minister’s response to those submissions,
    to allow Mr. Schreiber time to consider the response and any possible legal
    remedies then available to him under the <i>Extradition Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Minister, in turn, moves for an order quashing Mr. Schreiber’s application
    on three grounds.  First, the Minister argues that the application is a nullity
    as no “decision” has been made by the Minister that is susceptible to judicial
    review.  Next, the Minister submits that there is no legal requirement that
    a response to Mr. Schreiber’s further submissions be delivered within a fixed
    time frame.  Indeed, the Minister contends that he was not obliged to even
    receive the further submissions since they were provided outside the statutory
    time lines provided for under the <i>Extradition Act</i>.  Thus, Mr. Schreiber
    has no legal right to any response from the Minister, let alone a response
    by a set date.  Finally, the Minister argues that Mr. Schreiber is not entitled
    to what the Minister says is, in effect, a stay of the surrender order in
    this case, on any of the grounds advanced by Mr. Schreiber on this application.  The
    Minister emphasizes that the focus of this application is ss. 57 and 62 of
    the <i>Extradition Act</i>.</p>
  <h2>(2)       Discussion</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    agree that the record on this application does not support Mr. Schreiber’s
    claim that the Minister’s failure, to date, to respond to his further submissions
    reflects a decision never to respond to those submissions.  Nor does it support
    the contention that the Minister has already rejected those submissions without
    informing Mr. Schreiber of the fact of that rejection.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Indeed,
    the record before us suggests the opposite.  By letter dated May 14, 2009,
    counsel on behalf of the Minister wrote to Mr. Schreiber’s counsel, acknowledging
    that Mr. Schreiber’s correspondence was with the Minister and indicating
    that
    “a response will be provided in due course”.    </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Then,
    on June 5, 2009, the Minister wrote personally to Mr. Schreiber’s counsel,
    expressly informing him that the correspondence in question “is still under
    consider-ation”.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Also
    in his June 5 letter, the Minister advised that Mr. Schreiber would not be
    surrendered “before the conclusion of the hearings in relation to Part II
    (Policy Review) of the Oliphant Commission”.  This commitment was reiterated
    by the Minister in subsequent correspondence to Mr. Schreiber’s counsel dated
    June 26, 2009.  In his June 26 letter, the Minister also set out his understanding
    that the hearings component of Phase II of the Oliphant Royal Commission
    is scheduled to end on either July 28 or July 29, 2009.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thereafter,
    in a letter to Mr. Schreiber’s counsel dated July 2, 2009, the Minister indicated
    in part:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[W]ith respect to all your outstanding correspondence,
    you have been advised that I will reply in due course.  Pursuant to the <i>Extradition
    Act</i>, as the Minister of Justice of Canada, I am tasked with determining
    whether, when and how to respond to submissions made outside the statutory
    deadline.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Minister added that he would not be responding to any existing or future
    submissions made on behalf of Mr. Schreiber until Mr. Schreiber’s pending
    application was dealt with by this court.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Based
    on this correspondence, it is clear that the Minister has given an unqualified
    commitment to Mr. Schreiber’s counsel to respond to Mr. Schreiber’s further
    sub-missions, regardless of whether the Minister is legally obliged to do
    so.  There is no reason on this record to doubt that the Minister will honour
    his written commitment.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the same correspondence, the Minister or his counsel confirmed that Mr. Schreiber’s
    further submissions are under consideration.  Nothing on this record affords
    any evidence to the contrary.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Thus,
    there is no evidential support for Mr. Schreiber’s contention that the Minister
    has failed to consider or already rejected Mr. Schreiber’s further submissions.  Accordingly,
    at present, there is no Ministerial “decision” that is judicially reviewable.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    these circumstances, neither s. 57 nor s. 62 of the <i>Extradition Act</i> is
    engaged.  As relevant to the proceeding before us, the application of those
    provisions is conditional on the existence of a pending judicial review application.  No
    such application is properly before us.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    also reject the proposition that the Minister is obliged under the <i>Extradition
    Act</i> to respond to late submissions delivered by Mr. Schreiber within
    a fixed time frame.  Section 43(1) of the Act, which permits the delivery
    of submissions to the Minister at any time before the expiry of 30 days after
    the date of a committal order, has no application here.  Thirty days from
    the date of Mr. Schreiber’s committal order expired years ago.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    recognize that the Minister is authorized under s. 43(2) of the Act, in the
    exercise of his discretion, to accept submissions even after the expiry of
    the 30-day period contemplated by s. 43(1)
    “in circumstances that the Minister considers appropriate”.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    this case, the Minister was not obliged to accept Mr. Schreiber’s further
    late submissions.  Nonetheless, as he has done on several past occasions,
    the Minister chose to accept receipt of those submissions.  In addition,
    in this instance, he has also expressly agreed to respond to them.  Nothing
    in s. 43 of the Act obliges the Minister to do so by a set date.  Having
    agreed to respond to Mr. Schreiber’s submissions, in the absence of any evidence
    to the contrary, it must be presumed that the Minister’s response will accord
    with Mr. Schreiber’s statutory and <i>Charter</i> rights.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    these circumstances, we conclude that the Minister’s motion to quash must
    be granted.    </p>
  <h2>(3)       Disposition</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Accordingly,
    the Minister’s motion to quash is granted and Mr. Schreiber’s application
    is dismissed.</p>
