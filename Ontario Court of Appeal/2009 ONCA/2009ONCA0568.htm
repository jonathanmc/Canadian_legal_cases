    reasons for judgment in this matter were released on June 19, 2009.  In those
    reasons, we allowed the Bot Group’s appeal and directed that the parties’
    written submissions on costs be delivered to the Registrar of this court
    by the close of business on June 23, 2009.  We have now received and reviewed
    those submissions.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Bot Group was successful on appeal.  As a result, it seeks an award of costs
    in the following amounts: (i) costs in the total amount of $29,379.79, inclusive
    of disbursements and GST, in respect of the Bot Group’s successful stay motion
    in this court, which resulted in the stay of the judgment of Nolan J. of
    the Superior Court of Justice dated May 19, 2009 pending the determination
    of the Bot Group’s appeal therefrom to this court; and (ii) costs in the
    total amount of $43,793.37, inclusive of disbursements and GST, concerning
    the appeal.  Although not expressly stated in the Bot Group’s costs submissions,
    based on the hourly rates disclosed therein, we assume that the costs sought
    have been calculated on the partial indemnity scale.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown respondents (the “MTO”), who supported the Bot Group’s appeal, do not
    seek costs of the appeal.  However, the MTO does seek costs of the application
    brought by Coco Paving (1990) Inc. (“
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Coco”) before Nolan J. (the “Application”).  The MTO’s costs submissions
    indicate that counsel for the parties agreed that the costs of the Application
    would be fixed in the amount of $30,000.  It is that amount that the MTO
    seeks by way of a costs award in its favour.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    MTO opposed the Bot Group’s stay motion in this court.  As we have said,
    the Bot Group was successful in obtaining the requested stay order pending
    the determination of its appeal from the application judge’s judgment.  The
    costs of the stay motion were reserved to the Panel hearing the appeal.  The
    MTO takes the position that despite its opposition to the stay motion, no
    costs in respect of that motion should be awarded against it since its opposition
    was based on the public interest and was intended to avoid prejudicing the
    interests of any of the parties to the appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

    intervenor, Ontario Road Builders’

    in which it was involved, including the appeal.</p>

    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Coco does not challenge the Bot Group’s entitlement to costs of the appeal.  However,
    it submits that the costs claimed for the appeal are excessive and fail to
    reflect what
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Coco might reasonably have been expected to pay.  It argues that the costs
    of the appeal should be fixed in an amount in the range of $12,000 to $15,000.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Coco confirmed in its costs submissions that it agreed to fix the costs of
    the Application in the aggregate amount of $30,000.  It points out, however,
    that it undertook most of the preparation both for the Application and for
    various court attendances before Ducharme J. of the Superior Court of Justice,
    leading up to the argument of the Application.  It resists any award of the
    costs of the Application and related prior proceedings in favour of the MTO
    on several grounds, including : (i) the MTO did not raise the issue of the
    costs of the Application during oral argument of the appeal; (ii) the MTO
    did not appeal the decision of the application judge; (iii) the MTO failed
    to provide any bill of costs or other supporting materials concerning its
    claim for costs of the Application; and (iv) with respect to the merits of
    the Application, there were genuine issues of concern created by the terms
    of the MTO tender documents that required adjudication by the court.  In
    these circumstances, as the MTO contributed to the causes leading to the
    litigation, it is unfair and inappropriate for the MTO to now seek an award
    of costs in respect of the Application.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    although
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Coco does not contest the Bot Group’s entitlement to the costs of the stay
    motion in this court, it maintains that an appropriate costs award for that
    motion is in the range of $5,000 to $8,000.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>We
    agree that the Bot Group is entitled to its costs of the appeal and the stay
    motion in accordance with the usual rule that costs follow the event.  However,
    we also agree with
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Coco’s submission that the costs claimed are excessive in all the circumstances.  In
    our view, an appropriate costs award in favour of the Bot Group is the total
    amount of $30,000, inclusive of disbursements and GST, on account of both
    the stay motion and the appeal.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Based
    on this record, and essentially for the reasons advanced by
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Coco, we also agree that it is inappropriate to award the MTO its costs of
    the Application and we decline to do so.  Further, we regard it as inappropriate
    to award any costs of the stay motion against the MTO.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the result, therefore, the Bot Group is entitled to its costs of the stay
    motion and the appeal in the total amount of $30,000, inclusive of disbursements
    and GST, payable by
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Coco.  We make no award of costs in respect of the Application.</p>
