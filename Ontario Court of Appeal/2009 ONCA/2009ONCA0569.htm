      1999 Cadillac Seville, together with proof of paid up insurance, and required
      Mr. Rioux to pay child support of $837 per month on estimated income of
      $95,000.  The order also required Mr. Rioux to pay 89% of Kayla’s post-secondary
      education expenses and $700 every two weeks in spousal support.  The motion
      judge specifically left the issues of retroactive child support, post-secondary
      education contributions and past spousal support to a later hearing.</span></p>

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>In order to arrive at an equitable determination
    in this matter it was necessary to consider the history of the litigation
    and, most significantly, two Temporary Orders made by The Honourable Mr.
    Justice Riopelle on
    <st1:date Year="2006" Day="6" Month="7" w:st="on">
    July 6<sup>th</sup>, 2006 and
    <st1:date Year="2007" Day="11" Month="1" w:st="on">
    January 11<sup>th</sup>, 2007.  Those Temporary Orders include provision
    for child support and contribution to Kayla’s post-secondary education, as
    well as spousal support.  It is noteworthy that the spousal support payments
    were increased significantly by the second Order.  Having regard to the testimony
    at trial, I have no doubt that there remains significant arrears pursuant
    to those Orders.  I have considered in this decision that these arrears of
    child support (including contribution to post-secondary education) and spousal
    support shall be enforced and collected in due course.  Furthermore, I have
    been satisfied on this evidence that [Mr. Rioux] should earn approximately
    $105,000.00 from his employment during 2007, and I am confident that his
    position is relatively secure.</p>

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Since the Temporary Order for spousal support is
    being terminated by this Order, it is clear that the payment on this lump
    sum spousal support order fulfills the function of maintenance and therefore
    should be characterized as maintenance.  In effect, the same can be said
    from my consideration of both the issue of retroactive support and that [Ms.
    Rioux] should be reimbursed for some of her expenses since separation.  I
    have considered all of these factors in determining both the amount and the
    form of payment to [Ms. Rioux] from [Mr. Rioux].  I am also mindful of all
    of the objectives of the <i>Divorce Act</i> in fashioning the appropriate
    support order from this more than 20 year marriage, and I find that [Ms.

      made additional financial contributions to Kayla.  Second, it would appear
      that Kayla has contributed to her own university expenses through her earnings

      consideration of Ms. Rioux’s submission that </span><span lang=EN>the trial
      judge erred by failing to order Mr. Rioux to pay ongoing spousal support
      must start with an analysis of how the trial judge dealt with this issue.  An
      examination of the reasons as a whole, particularly para. 5, leaves it
      unclear as to whether or not the trial judge provided Ms. Rioux with ongoing
      spousal support.  On the one hand he does refer to the $100,000 lump sum
      award as a “lump sum payment of spousal support”, suggesting that part
      of the $100,000 is for spousal support.  On the other hand, several aspects
      of his reasons suggest otherwise.   First, the trial judge specifically
      provides that the award not be taxable.  Second, at the end of para. 5,
      he refers to Ms. Rioux as being self-supporting.  Third, and most significantly,
      the amount of the award is insufficient to include the other items it is
      said to cover plus an amount that would account for ongoing spousal support – the
      equalization payment alone was $90,000.</span></p>

      observations lead to the conclusion that the trial judge erred in the way
      in which he dealt with spousal support.  If the trial judge intended to
      provide Ms. Rioux with ongoing spousal support, he failed to do so as the
      numbers simply do not add up.  If he did not intend to provide Ms. Rioux
      with spousal support, then in my view, he erred as, based on the analysis

      twenty years’ duration in which Mr. Rioux worked outside of the home and
      Ms. Rioux managed the household, raised Kayla, and worked part-time.  The

    support order was not warranted.  However, Ms. Rioux is entitled to further
    non-compensatory transitional support to soften the impact of the decrease
