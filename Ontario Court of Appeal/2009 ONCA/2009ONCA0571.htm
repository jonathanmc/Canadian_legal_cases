    to the Act.</p>

      plaintiff suffered injuries as the result of being struck by a motor vehicle
      on April 9, 1999.  A trial of his damage action resulted in a jury verdict
      on March 30, 2007.  At the conclusion of the trial, the trial judge heard
      a motion to determine whether or not the appellant had suffered a catastrophic
      impairment within the meaning of s. 267.5 of the Act.</span></p>

      appellant appeals the trial judge’s ruling and requests an order setting

      that the appellant is catastrophically impaired within the meaning of O.
      Reg. 461/96 s. 5(1)(e)(i) and is entitled to the future healthcare benefits
      awarded to him by the jury at trial.</span></p>

      under O. Reg. 403/96, the appellant was catastrophically impaired.  It
      is to be noted that the definition for catastrophic impairment was the

      neurobehavioural, and neuroemotional changes and their day-to-day function

      appellant’s position is succinctly stated in paragraphs 48 and 49 of his
      factum:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>48.       On a plain reading of
      the relevant section of the Regulation, so long as the plaintiff can prove
      that the accident caused him or her to sustain a brain impairment that
      resulted in at least one GSC score of 9 or less, taken within a reasonable
      time post-accident, then the injured person is deemed to be catastrophically
      impaired. The fact that subsequent GCS scores are 10 or greater is irrelevant
      to the statutory analysis.  The focus is on the injured person having sustained
      a period of unconsciousness that is causally related to the accident.</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span lang=EN-US>49.       In the present case,
      the evidence is that Lui’s initial GCS scores were administered within
      a reasonable time after the incident by persons trained for that purpose,
      and were less than 9.  There were no confounding factors.  There is no
      evidence to the contrary, and the trial judge so found.  Therefore, Liu
      patently meets the test for a finding of catastrophic impairment.  The
      trial judge erred in law when he found otherwise.  There are no other factors
      relevant to this statutory test.</span></p>

    the Appellant should not be considered catastrophically impaired as his GCS
        readings rose to 12/15 within 33 minutes of the collision and continued
        to rise thereafter.  This period of time is well within what would be
        considered reasonable in all the circumstances of this case.  Given that
        the GCS scores continued to rise following the reading of 12, the appellant
        should not be considered catastrophically impaired on the basis of the
        GCS readings.</span></p>

      trial judge concluded that the appellant had a GCS of 9 or less within
      a reasonable time after the accident.  The only other necessary conclusion
      for the trial judge was whether the appellant suffered a brain impairment.  In
      paragraph 11 of his reasons he very clearly concluded that he did: “[t]here
      is no doubt that the plaintiff received a brain injury as a result of the
      accident.”</span></p>

      my view having made those findings the appellant met the statutory definition

      is in error and cannot stand.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      language of the statute is clear – catastrophic impairment means brain
      impairment – and it is not disputed here that the appellant suffered a
      brain impairment as the result of the accident – that results in a score
      of 9 or less on the GCS according to a test administered within a reasonable
      period of time after the accident by a person trained for that purpose.  There
      is no issue that the tests were administered by persons trained for that
      purpose.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      respondents’ objection is solely based on the fact that there were GCSs
      following the accident, which they submit were also “administered within
      a reasonable period of time after the accident”, which were greater than
      9.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      my view the answer to the respondents’ objection is the plain language
      of the legislation.  Provided there is a brain impairment, all that is
      required is one GCS score of 9 or less within a reasonable time following
      the accident.  It is a legal definition to be met by a claimant and not
      a medical test.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>I
      agree with the appellant’s submission that the fact that there may have
      been other higher scores also within a reasonable time after the accident
      is irrelevant.  </span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      my view the trial judge fell into error in equating the statutory test
      to a medical one.  It is not.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[30]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span lang=EN-US>Any
      notion of catastrophic injury, other than the specific meaning ascribed
      to that term by the legislation must be discarded when considering whether
      a claimant meets the statutory test.   </span>The statutory scheme creates
      a bright line rule which is relatively easy to apply. This enhances the
      ability of those looking to the definition to know what injuries will and
      will not be considered catastrophic. Having the same definition for both
      no fault and third party liability claims avoids inconsistency. The ease
      with which the rule can be applied adds an element of predictability which
      will facilitate the settlement of claims.</p>

      matters not that there is some evidence - albeit disputed evidence - that
      the appellant is capable of managing his property, clothing, hygiene, shelter,

      that is required is a brain impairment and a GCS reading of 9 or below
      within a reasonable period of time after the accident. The appellant met
      both criteria on the trial judge’s findings and is entitled to recover
      damages for health care costs in accordance with the verdict of the jury.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I

lang=EN-US>Dr. Kaplan’s uncontested medical report was admitted at trial.  As
      stated in para. 20 of the appellant’s factum: “Dr. Kaplan also reviewed
      and considered the GCS scores taken by the ambulance attendants, and the
      timing thereof, as well as numerous medical reports.  He noted that the
      DAC team had deemed Lui to have a catastrophic impairment for the purposes

      ruling in <i>Young.</i></span></p>
