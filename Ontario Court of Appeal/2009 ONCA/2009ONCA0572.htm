  <h2>I.          OVERVIEW</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Dr.
    J. Burnett, an anaesthetist, appeals from a judgment that found her liable
    for medical negligence causing bodily injury, including hypoxia, myocardial
    infarction, and brain damage, to Mario Chainauskas shortly after surgery.  Mr.
    Chainauskas was resuscitated but lived in an impaired state until he died
    approximately four years later.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Before
    the trial of this action, the respondents agreed to discontinue their claims
    against the hospital, four other physicians, and four nurses involved in
    Mr. Chainauskas’s surgery and resuscitation.  The parties agreed upon damages
    in the approximate amount of $3.5 million.  The appellant, therefore, appeals
    on the sole issue of liability. </p>
  <h2>II.        BACKGROUND</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Mr.
    Chainauskas was 5’ 8” and weighed 410 pounds.  He had a body mass index (BMI)
    of 60.  Anyone with a BMI of 40 is considered to be morbidly obese, with
    all the attendant health problems.  Mr. Chainauskas suffered from, among
    other things, high blood pressure and hypertension; in addition, he had a
    family history of heart problems.  He was categorized as four out of six
    on the American Society of Anesthesia scale, meaning that his obese condition
    was a constant threat to his life.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    July 16, 1999, Mr. Chainauskas went into
    <st1:place
w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    St. Joseph’s Hospital and Home for a gastric bypass operation.  The surgeon
    was Dr. Kenneth Reed.  Four days before the operation, Mr. Chainauskas underwent
    an anaesthetic consultation with Dr. Burnett.  According to Dr. Burnett’s
    report, Mr. Chainauskas had a very large face that would make it extremely
    difficult to hold a mask on to ventilate.  She decided to proceed with an “awake
    intubation” wherein the back of the throat is frozen and the tube is installed
    while the patient is still breathing on his own.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    surgery proceeded uneventfully.  At its conclusion, and at the time of extubation
    by Dr. Burnett, problems arose resulting in Mr. Chainauskas’s experiencing
    cerebral hypoxia (a lack of oxygen to the brain), myocardial infarction (a
    heart attack), and permanent brain damage.  Mr. Chainauskas lived in an impaired
    state in various institutions until his death just over four years later.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    action was commenced by Mr. Chainauskas’s wife on behalf of the estate of
    her late husband, herself and their three children.  It was originally instituted
    against five doctors, the hospital, and four nurses.  By the time the action
    reached trial, only Dr. Burnett remained as a defendant.  The <span style='line-height:200%'>doctors
    who were previously defendants in the action and represented by counsel for
    the appellant were called as witnesses by the plaintiffs at trial.  Because
    of this, the plaintiffs raised certain issues with the trial judge in connection
    with the giving of their testimony, which now relate specifically to this
    appeal.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>At
      trial, the issues to be determined by the court were: (i) whether Dr. Burnett
      was negligent in extubating Mr. Chainauskas prematurely; (ii) whether Dr.
      Burnett was negligent in failing to reintubate Mr. Chainauskas in a timely
      fashion; and (iii) whether the alleged negligence caused the subsequent
      damage.  The trial judge found that Dr. Burnett negligently extubated Mr.
      Chainauskas before he was able to maintain his airway and that this was
      a direct cause of the heart attack he suffered.</span></p>
  <h2>III.       ISSUES</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant raises two issues on this appeal: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>(i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    trial judge was not impartial as between the parties; that is, the conduct
    of the trial judge and his reasons create a reasonable apprehension of bias;
    and,  </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>(ii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    trial judge made palpable and overriding errors. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appeal must be dismissed.  In my view, the appellant has failed to establish
    either an apprehension of bias on the part of the trial judge or that he
    committed any palpable and overriding errors.</p>
  <h2>IV.       ANALYSIS</h2>
  <h2>1.         Reasonable apprehension of bias<i></i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In <i>R.
      v. S.(R.D.)</i>, [1997] 3 S.C.R. 484, at para. 113, Cory J. notes, for
      the majority in the result, that an allegation of a reasonable apprehension
      of bias calls into question “the personal integrity of the judge”.  Thus,
      the threshold for an allegation of bias on the part of a judge is high.  An
      absence of bias is described by Cory J., at para. 104, as being “a state
      of mind in which the adjudicator is disinterested in the outcome, and is
      open to persuasion by the evidence and submissions.”  Bias, in contrast, “denotes
      a state of mind that is in some way predisposed to a particular result,
      or that is closed with regard to particular issues”: para. 105.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    para. 111, Cory J. adopts the test applied by de Grandpré J. in his dissenting
    reasons in <i>Committee for Justice and Liberty v. National Energy Board</i>,
    [1978] 1 S.C.R. 369, at p. 394: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[T]he apprehension of bias must be a reasonable
    one, held by reasonable and right-minded persons, applying themselves to
    the question and obtaining thereon the required information....[The] test
    is “what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically –
    and having thought the matter through – conclude….”</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>And
    finally, at para. 112, Cory J. holds that the grounds to demonstrate an apprehension
    of bias must be substantial.  Therefore, it is clear that there is a high
    threshold to be met on an allegation of judicial bias and that there is a
    presumption of integrity accorded to judges. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant argues that she has met this high threshold in this case and that
    the trial judge’s apprehension of bias is evidenced in two ways.  First,
    the appellant contends that before hearing any evidence from any physician,
    the trial judge had already concluded that their previous joint representation
    by defence trial counsel was improper.  She asserts that the following <span style='line-height:
200%'>statements made by the trial judge at paras. 19 – 23 of his reasons for
    judgment reflect this predisposition:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>joint
    representation was “somewhat unsavoury”; </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    purpose of joint representation was to
    “ensure” that the interests of all physician defendants “were aligned”; </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>because
    of joint representation, “obviously…no cross claims existed”; and, </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>an “apprehension” about
    the “reliability” of the doctors’ evidence existed because the doctors had
    received legal advice from common counsel.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Second,
      according to the</span> appellant, the trial judge was predisposed to see
      significant conflicts in the evidence of the treating doctors.  The appellant
      argues that in making these findings, the trial judge made the following “palpable
      misapprehensions” of the evidence:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>First,
    the trial judge stated that Dr. Reed “did not see any movement in Mr. Chainauskas
    at all at [the] time” before being transferred to an ICU bed.  Dr. Reed’s
    evidence, however, was that he could not <i>recall</i> movement and that
    his operative note was meant to convey the impression that Mr. Chainauskas
    was “awakening”, as opposed to not moving at all. </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='font-family:Symbol;'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Second,
    Dr. Mercer-Choong, a former anaesthetist, did not testify that Mr. Chainauskas <i>was
    sitting up</i> on the operating table, as the trial judge stated.  Rather,
    she said that he was <i>trying</i> to sit up.  <i></i></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    disagree that the appellant has satisfied the high onus required for this
    issue.  As I will demonstrate, the appellant has failed to establish that
    either of the two instances of impugned conduct demonstrates an apprehension
    of bias on the part of the trial judge.  </p>
  <h2><i>(i)        Trial judge’s predisposition</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='color:black'>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>As
    noted above, in this case some of the medical professionals called as witnesses
    by the plaintiffs at trial had been represented by defence counsel before
    the plaintiffs discontinued their claims against all but one defendant, the
    appellant.  As a result, defence counsel was entitled to cross-examine witnesses
    at trial who had been his former clients in the same action.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='color:black'>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Because
    of these circumstances, at the commencement of the trial, plaintiffs’ counsel
    advised the trial judge that they would be bringing a motion concerning the
    evidence of two of their own witnesses.  Both witnesses were the treating
    physicians of <span style='line-height:200%'>Mr. Chainauskas </span>and they
    were former named defendants in the action.  The plaintiffs sought two forms
    of relief: (i) the right of plaintiffs’ counsel to cross-examine their own
    witnesses on the basis of adversity; and, (ii) an order restricting the cross-examination
    of these witnesses by the appellant’s counsel because he had formerly acted
    for them in this same proceeding.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='color:black'>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>All
      counsel agreed that the first part of the motion was premature and that
      the trial judge should determine only whether to restrict defence counsel
      from cross-examining their former clients.  The trial judge decided that
      both requests for relief were premature.  He described his approach as
      follows:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I am very disposed, however, since all doctors have
    a commonality of representation, to appreciate the problem the plaintiffs
    find themselves in and I intend to do the following: (a) advise both doctors
    of the unusual position in which they find themselves prior to them giving
    evidence, and (b) reserve my decision until such time as cross-examination
    of each of them arises.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>No
    objections were made to this decision.  The trial judge then gave instructions
    to the doctors at the commencement of their testimony.  The thrust of those
    instructions is illustrated in the following exchange:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The Court:      Dr. Reed, just before you start,
    you are in somewhat of a unique position in this case because you were sued
    at one time.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Witness:         I understand.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The Court:      And the defence counsel were your
    lawyers.  It makes it somewhat difficult because you have received advice
    already while you were a defendant from the very same lawyers that are acting
    for the remaining defendant, Dr. Burnett, okay, and you are now being called
    and asked to give evidence by somebody who was cross-examining you at one
    time.  I want you to discharge that from your mind.  I want you to give unbiased,
    fair evidence, answer the questions that are put to you, and it will save
    the court a lot of trouble, okay? </p>

    during his exchanges with counsel, and in his subsequent rulings, the trial
    judge made it clear that he found no evidence of adversity in relation to
    the plaintiffs’ witnesses despite their having been formerly represented
    by defence counsel.  In addition, he found no basis to restrict cross-examination
    of the witnesses by defence counsel.  Indeed, he found the doctors “to have
    been very co-operative and open”, and as a result, he allowed defence counsel
    to cross-examine them. </p>

color:black'>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the circumstances, the trial judge was put in a somewhat difficult situation
    by the strategic decision of defence counsel.   That is, defence counsel
    initially decided to act for all of the defendants, during discoveries and
    until the discontinuance of the action against those defendants, and then
    decided to cross-examine those same individuals when they became witnesses
    in the case.  The plaintiffs viewed this as problematic and were concerned
    about potential bias of the witnesses.  The trial judge was required to address
    the issue once it was raised by plaintiffs’ counsel.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='color:black'>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    plaintiffs were clearly entitled to a ruling on this issue, given their obvious
    and legitimate concerns.  Nevertheless, the trial judge dismissed the plaintiffs’ motion.  <span
style='line-height:200%'>At no point in the proceedings did defence counsel take
    issue with the trial judge’s approach or to his comments.  </span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='color:black'>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is true that the trial judge did comment on the practice of acting for multiple
    defendants in a single action and its potential for conflict in a particular
    case.  This was a legitimate observation.  However, he went on to specifically
    determine that that potential for conflict was not realized in this case
    and that the witnesses, who plaintiffs’
    counsel was concerned would be inclined to react adversely to questioning
    from plaintiffs’ counsel, did not demonstrate any such inclination.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>There
    was nothing wrong, in my view, with the trial judge’s comment regarding appellant’s
    counsel “ensuring that [the] interests [of the doctors originally sued] were
    aligned”.  Indeed, appellant’s counsel was obliged to do this in order to
    be able to act for the doctors jointly.  This statement was an innocuous
    step in the trial judge’s reasoning process.  It does not demonstrate bias. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

color:black'>[25]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>Furthermore, </span>the
    trial judge simply notes the fact that many of the witnesses were previously
    represented by defence counsel.  He then combines this issue with the discrepancies
    in the evidence.  He concludes at para. 23:  “The above two issues left me
    with great apprehension as to the reliability of the testimony of the doctors
    as it was provided after they had learned about the heart attack and after
    they had received legal advice in preparation for their joint defence in
    this action.”   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    my view, the language used by the trial judge in the impugned paragraphs
    is not evidence of any predisposition of bias.  As the respondents argue,
    the trial judge was simply addressing an issue which needed to be addressed,
    namely, the plaintiffs’
    concern about bias amongst the doctors.  Had the trial judge not addressed
    this issue, his reasons would, arguably, be susceptible to attack on the
    basis of insufficiency.<span

    to the extent that the reasons of the trial judge could be read as suggesting
    that there was something improper in the conduct of the lawyers for the defendants,
    I wish to plainly state that in this case there was no impropriety.  I see
    nothing improper in the lawyers' conduct and it is not necessarily the case
    that a lawyer is precluded from representing more than one physician defendant,
    particularly here, where the suit was discontinued against all but one of
    the doctors.  </p>

    argument the appellant proposes in relation to the trial judge’s palpable
    misapprehension of evidence is not being advanced as a stand alone ground
    of appeal in the typical <i>Morrissey</i> sense: <i>R. v. Morrissey</i> (1995),
    22 O.R. (3d) 514 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:country-region
 w:st="on">C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  That is, it is not alleged that the misapprehensions, by themselves,
    would result in reversible error.  Rather, the misapprehensions are said
    to be demonstrative of the trial judge’s bias in favour of the respondents.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

      already noted, the appellant refers to the trial judge’s treatment of the
      evidence of Dr. Reed and </span>Dr. Mercer-Choong to support her argument
      of bias.  She<span
style='line-height:200%'> contends that w</span>hen stated accurately, the evidence
      of both witnesses is consistent with the <span
style='line-height:200%'>appellant’s evidence.  That is to say, </span>the evidence
      of these witnesses reflects a patient emerging from anaesthesia on the
      operating table, exhibiting some movement.  As I understand this part of
      the appellant’s argument, she contends that the trial judge misapprehended
      the evidence of both Dr. Reed and Dr. Mercer-Choong either to conform to,
      or because of, his predisposition about the result.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

color:black'>[33]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%;color:black'>First,
      the suggestion that the trial judge misapprehended Dr. Reed’s testimony
      is unwarranted.  Dr. Reed testified as follows: (i) he did
    “not recall [the patient] making any movements” when moving the patient to
    the ICU bed; (ii) the patient was still unconscious from the anaesthetic
    at that time; and, (iii) he did not talk to the patient during the transfer
    or when the patient was on the ICU bed because the patient was unconscious.  Dr.
    Reed’s evidence was <i>not</i> that he did not recall <i>whether</i> the
    patient made any movements.  This testimony provides ample support for the
    trial judge’s finding, at para. 33, that “Dr. Reed did not see any movement
    in Mr. Chainauskas at all at that time.”</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

color:black'>[34]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>Second, </span>the
    suggested misstatement or misapprehension of the evidence of Dr. Mercer-Choong
    that may have been made by the trial judge is, in my view, not an essential
    element of the trial judge’s reasoning process.  It is not, as the appellant
    asserts, demonstrative of the trial judge’s bias in favour of the respondents.  The
    trial judge did not rely on his perception of Dr. Mercer-Choong’s evidence
    in assessing the appellant’s credibility. Rather, <span style='line-height:200%;color:black'>t</span>he
    trial judge rejected the appellant’s trial testimony, at para. 93, because
    it was inconsistent with her contemporaneous notes — the record that the
    appellant created at the time of the incident — and it was inconsistent with
    Dr. Reed's testimony as to what happened on the day in question, which evidence
    the trial judge accepted as he was entitled to do.  Furthermore, the experts
    for the plaintiffs make it clear as to what should have been in the records
    and how the absence of such information is not consistent with the appellant’s
    record-keeping of other parts of her work that day.  In short, the trial
    judge supported his assessment of the appellant’s credibility with reference
    to evidence other than that of Dr. Mercer-Choong.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

color:black'>[35]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='color:black'>The
      trial judge rejected the evidence of some of the defence witnesses, including
      Dr. Mercer-Choong.  He did so for reasons that directly related to the
      nature of the testimony of those witnesses, and not because of any alleged
      bias on his part.  At para. 72 of his reasons, the trial judge had this
      to say about Dr. Mercer-Choong’s evidence:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>This evidence concerns me. The manner in which this
    evidence was obtained also <span style='letter-spacing:.1pt'>concerns me.  Dr.
    Mercer-Choong's observations do not coincide with the evidence of Dr. Reed </span>or
    Dr. Burnett.  Dr. Mercer-Choong was also examined for discovery and this
    evidence was never [proffered].  It was apparently extracted from her by
    plaintiff’s counsel, only after counsel <span style='letter-spacing:-.1pt'>attended </span><span style='letter-spacing:.7pt'>to </span><span style='letter-spacing:
.05pt'>interview her, just prior to the trial, and after Dr. Mercer-Choong had
    been released as a defendant in this action.</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote style='line-height:200%'><span style='line-height:200%'>The
      appellant submits that these comments by the trial judge were unfair because
      plaintiff’s counsel failed to identify any question at discovery that required
      disclosure of Dr. Mercer-Choong’s observations of the patient on the operating
      table.</span></p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

      my view, rejecting Dr. Mercer-Choong’s evidence was not due to any bias
      on the part of the trial judge.  Even if Dr. Mercer-Choong was not directly
      asked at discovery about her observations of the patient on the operating
      table, it was open to the trial judge to note that she did not volunteer
      the information. In addition, even if Dr. Mercer-Choong’s evidence was
      consistent with that of the appellant, the trial judge was entitled to
      reject it as inconsistent with that of Dr. Reed. As discussed above, the
      trial judge had sufficient reason to accept Dr. Reed’s testimony over that
      of the appellant.</span></p>

    one that is “plainly seen”: <i>Housen</i> at para. 6.  An error that is “overriding” is

      appellant in this case argues that the trial judge erred in respect of
      six findings of fact.  With the above principles in mind, I will address
      each of the trial judge’s impugned findings in order.</span></p>
  <h2><i>(i)        There was no unusually high risk for a heart attack </i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[44]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    first impugned factual finding is the trial judge’s conclusion, at para.
    110, that the patient did not present an
    “unusually high risk for a heart attack as he had been found clinically sound
    in that regard prior to the operation.”  The appellant argues that in coming
    to this conclusion, the trial judge ignored the evidence of Dr. Jablonsky,
    as well as the concession of the plaintiffs’ expert, Dr. Rakowski, that the
    patient had some coronary artery disease.  I disagree.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[45]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>When
      the trial judge’s conclusion is read in its entirety, any appearance of
      inconsistency vanishes.  The actual language used by the trial judge at
      para. 110 is as follows:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>While all experts deemed Mr. Chainauskas to be a
    high risk patient I accept the plaintiff’s expert evidence that there was
    no unusually high risk for a heart attack as he had been found clinically
    sound in that regard prior to the operation.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[46]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Here,
    the trial judge acknowledges that the patient was a “high risk” patient,
    but finds that there was not an “<i>unusually</i> high risk” of a heart attack
    (emphasis added).  This conclusion is not inconsistent with the patient having
    some coronary artery disease.  It was open to the trial judge to accept the
    evidence of Dr. Hewak, at para. 11, that the patient did “not have any significant
    medical problem that would be prohibitive for him proceeding on with surgery.” </p>
  <h2><i>(ii)       Causation</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[47]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Next,
    the appellant argues that the trial judge erred in concluding that the chances
    of a heart attack occurring without an airway obstruction were unrealistically
    remote.  In making this argument, the appellant assumes that the trial judge
    relied on the appellant’s evidence, noted at para. 58 of his reasons, that
    “99.9% of the time, if distress occurs following extubation, it is a respiratory
    problem.”  The appellant’s point is that it does not follow from this proposition
    that an airway problem caused the heart attack.  As the appellant puts it,
    to assume otherwise is to commit the <i>post hoc, ergo propter hoc</i> fallacy,
    according to which the first event must be the cause of the second event,
    merely because the second event followed the first. </p>

style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[48]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>It
    is uncontroversial that the assumption that an airway problem was the cause
    of a heart attack merely because the former preceded the latter would be
    fallacious.  This, however, was not the trial judge’s reasoning.  Rather,
    the trial judge concluded, at para. 107, that when the patient’s airway became
    blocked, this “difficult, stressful oxygen deprived condition” caused the
    heart attack, and that there was no other plausible explanation for why a
    heart attack occurred at that time.   </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[49]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>In
      reaching this conclusion, the trial judge relied, at para. 109, on the
      evidence of the respondents’ experts, Dr. Mazzai and Dr. Rakowski, that
      the airway collapse was likely or quite possibly the cause of the heart
      attack.  It was open to him to accept this expert medical opinion.</span></p>
  <h2><i>(iii)     The time between extubation and airway collapse </i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[50]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant also argues that the trial judge failed to determine the time between
    extubation and airway collapse, and to resolve the controversy among the
    experts as to how long it takes asphyxia to cause cardiac arrest.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[51]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant, however, has not established that it was necessary for the trial
    judge to determine how long it takes asphyxia to cause cardiac arrest, since
    the respondents’ theory was not that the asphyxia itself caused cardiac arrest,
    but rather that the asphyxia caused additional stress, and that this stress
    is what caused the heart attack.  Indeed, as noted above, the trial judge
    accepted this argument, relying on the expert opinions of Dr. Mazzai and
    Dr. Rakowski, which he was entitled to accept. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[52]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant goes on to argue that the trial judge erroneously focused on the
    time between extubation and reintubation, which was irrelevant since the
    cardiac problem had manifested itself before reintubation.  </p>

style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[53]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant has not established that the trial judge’s focus on the time between
    extubation and reintubation was unwarranted, given that this was one of the
    three issues at trial, as the trial judge notes at para. 17 of his reasons.  In
    fact, he was obligated to address this issue, since one of the plaintiff’s
    allegations, as noted at para. 98, was that Dr. Burnett acted below the standard
    of care in failing to reintubate in a timely fashion.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[54]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Somewhat
    paradoxically, the appellant argues not only that the time between extubation
    and reintubation was irrelevant, but also that the trial judge erred in not
    making a finding regarding the duration of this period.  According to the
    appellant, by concluding, at para. 101, that whatever its duration, it was
    long enough to result in “a marked period of hypoxia...leading to the subsequent
    damage”, the trial judge engaged in circular reasoning.  Again, I disagree.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[55]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>Although
      the trial judge did not make a finding regarding the exact duration between
      extubation and reintubation, he nevertheless did make a finding on this
      issue; specifically, he held, at para. 101, that the “time between extubation
      and reintubation was considerably longer than what Dr. Burnett testified”.  More
      to the point, it is not clear what the appellant seeks to achieve by attacking
      the trial judge’s reasoning as circular, since the trial judge ultimately
      held, at para. 100, that he was “not satisfied on the balance of probabilities
      that there was any delay in reintubation that was below the standard of
      care or impacted negatively upon the patient’s condition.”  Further, as
      the appellant emphasizes, the period between extubation and reintubation
      was not relevant to the issue of causation, as the trial judge found, at
      para. 100, that the “damage” (that is, the heart attack, which caused the
      brain damage) was already “done” by the time Dr. Reed returned, which was
      prior to reintubation. </span></p>
  <h2><i>(iv)      Steps to ensure paralysis reversal </i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[56]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Next,
    the appellant contends that the trial judge erred in finding, at para. 97,
    that Dr. Burnett “failed to take the necessary steps to ensure paralysis
    reversal prior to extubation.”  In support of this position, the appellant
    submits that since the ventilator was disconnected while the patient was
    still on the operating table, if his paralysis had not been reversed, his
    respiratory difficulties would have begun before he was transferred to the
    ICU bed.  In fact, the appellant argues that there was
    “no dispute” that the ventilator was disconnected while the patient was still
    on the operating table.  Nevertheless, there was evidence led at trial to
    contradict this argument.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[57]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    a portion of the read-ins, counsel for the plaintiffs put an article to Dr.
    Burnett, according to which, “[i]t is important to remember that adequate
    ventilation through the tube does not guarantee the muscle strength to maintain
    the airway.”  Dr. Burnett agreed with the accuracy of this statement.  In
    other words, breathing on one’s own while intubated is not a sufficient indication
    that paralysis has reversed enough for the patient to breathe on his or her
    own without intubation.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[58]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Given
    this, it was open to the trial judge to find that Dr. Burnett “failed to
    take the necessary steps to ensure paralysis reversal prior to extubation”,
    even if he also accepted Dr. Burnett’s evidence that the patient was breathing
    on his own after the ventilator was switched off but before extubation.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[59]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant goes on to argue that the trial judge’s finding that paralysis
    was not reversed prior to extubation is also inconsistent with the finding
    that the patient became combative.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[60]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span style='line-height:200%'>There
      is no inconsistency in the trial judge’s reasoning on this issue, in my
      view.  The trial judge found, at para. 79, that the patient became combative <i>after</i> extubation
      and loss of the airway.  In contrast, the applicable standard of care required
      that Dr. Burnett ensure that paralysis had been reversed <i>prior</i> to
      extubation, as the trial judge notes at para. 84.  Further, it is not clear
      that combativeness is an indication that paralysis has reversed sufficiently
      to breathe on one’s own. The trial judge found, at para. 84, that the two
      basic indicia of paralysis reversal are consciousness and muscle strength.  At
      para. 86, he lists the steps one should take in order to identify these
      indicia; observing combativeness or any analogous state is not among them.</span></p>
  <h2><i>(v)       Response to specific commands prior to extubation</i></h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[61]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellant also argues that the trial judge erred in finding that the standard
    of care requires the anaesthetist to ensure that the patient is able to respond
    to specific commands before extubation.  More specifically, according to
    the appellant, the trial judge erroneously failed to mention the evidence
    of Dr. Sullivan and Dr. Sellery that an experienced anaesthetist can assess
    the patient’s level of consciousness by other means.  In doing so, the trial
    judge is said to have erred by preferring one respectable body of medical
    opinion to another, contrary to the principle set out in  <i>Connell v. Tanner</i> (2002),
    158 O.A.C. 268 (Ont. C.A.), at para. 1, where Laskin J.A. stated:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>A doctor who treats a patient in accordance with
    a respectable body of medical opinion – even if it is a minority opinion – will
    not normally be held liable in negligence.  The rationale for this principle
    is that courts lack the institutional competence to decide between reasonable
    medical practices.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[62]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    problem with this argument is that the trial judge did not find that Dr.
    Burnett’s practice conformed with “a respectable body of medical opinion”,
    minority or otherwise.  Rather, at para. 86 of his reasons, he listed six
    requirements that make up the “basic” standard for establishing consciousness
    and muscle strength, and found, at paras. 91 and 97, that Dr. Burnett failed
    to comply with at least two of them.  Further, the trial judge rejected Dr.
    Burnett’s testimony that the patient did display some indicia of consciousness
    on the basis that it was inconsistent with both Dr. Reed’s evidence and Dr.
    Burnett’s contemporaneous notes.  Given this, there simply was no issue of
    competing bodies of respectable medical opinion.</p>

style='line-height:200%;"Times New Roman"'>[63]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    the appellant submits that the trial judge erred in resolving the scientific
    question of whether reaching for the endotracheal tube is a reflex or manifests
    purposive behaviour, because the only neurologist who testified on the point
    characterized it as purposive and was not cross-examined on the issue.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

    para. 97, the trial judge chose to accept the evidence of Dr. Mazzai, an
    anaesthetist, on this point, which was that any pulling on the endotracheal
    tube was a reflex action.  Although Dr. Mazzai was not a neurologist, his
    training and experience as an anaesthetist was sufficient to qualify him
    to give an expert opinion on whether reaching for the tube after having been
    anaesthetized is a reflex.  It was therefore open to the trial judge to accept
    this expert opinion evidence.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span

      the end, I conclude that the appellant has not demonstrated that the trial
