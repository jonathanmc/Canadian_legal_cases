style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>This
    case comes to the court by way of leave to appeal from the Ontario Court
    of Justice on two questions: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>(i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>When
    the Crown has come into possession of a defence document that is protected
    by solicitor-client and litigation privilege, does the accused bear the burden
    of proving actual prejudice or will prejudice be presumed?</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>(ii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Additionally,

style='"Times New Roman"'>[2]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    a prosecution under the <i>Occupational Health and Safety Act</i>, R.S.O.
    1990, c.O.1 (the “<i>OHSA</i>”), the Crown sought to have admitted into evidence
    an investigation report found to be protected by solicitor-client privilege.  The
    report was also found to have been obtained in breach of s. 8 of the <i>Charter
    of Rights and Freedoms</i>.  A justice of the peace granted a stay of the
    charges against the appellants based on an abuse of process including breaches
    of ss. 7 and 11(d) of the <i>Charter</i>.  On appeal to the Ontario Court
    of Justice, the stay of the charges was set aside.  The appellants appeal
    to this court pursuant to the grant of leave to appeal.</p>
  <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[3]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    January 21, 2002, an employee of Vipond Inc., a subcontractor of Bruce Power
    Inc., was seriously injured in a fall while working at the nuclear power
    plant in
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Tiverton,
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    Ontario.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[4]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the day of the accident, Inspector Peter Martin (the “Inspector”) of the
    Ministry of Labour (the “MOL”) attended at the power plant and commenced
    an investigation into the accident.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[5]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Immediately
    after the accident, in-house counsel for Bruce Power contacted outside counsel
    for legal advice in anticipation that charges would be laid by the MOL under
    the <i>OHSA</i>.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[6]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Outside
    counsel advised that Bruce Power undertake its own investigation of the accident
    with the purpose of producing a report for use by counsel in providing legal
    advice to the company and its employees and for use in the defence of the
    anticipated charges under the <i>OHSA</i> against the company and its employees.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[7]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    the day following the accident, an investigation team was created, which
    included both management and union employees.  Ian Ritchie, a representative
    of the Power Workers’
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Union, was a member of the team.  Terms of reference were produced, which
    expressly provided that the investigation was undertaken in contemplation
    of litigation and that all documents created during the investigation, including
    the investigation report, were to be placed in the custody of Bruce Power’s
    legal department where their confidentiality would be maintained.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[8]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Five
    members of the investigative team, including Mr. Ritchie, conducted interviews
    of a number of people between January 22, 2002 and February 4, 2002.  The
    people who were interviewed were expressly told, prior to the interview,
    that any report of the interview would remain confidential for use by legal
    counsel in anticipation of the charges under the <i>OHSA</i>.  They were
    also advised that information obtained from the interviews would not be provided
    to the MOL or any other third party.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[9]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>A
    draft investigation report was prepared and was clearly marked in large,
    bold type, “Confidential”.  The draft report did not identify people by name.  However,
    people were identified by their job classification or job description.  It
    was circulated to team members with instructions in writing to keep the information
    confidential.  They were also instructed to return or destroy all copies
    of the report in their possession.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[10]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>All
    members of the team, except Mr. Ritchie of the Power Workers’
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Union, returned their copies of the report.  When the issue was raised with
    Mr. Ritchie, he gave an undertaking that he would destroy his copies of the
    report.  He subsequently resiled from that undertaking.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[11]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>At
    some point in early 2002, the Inspector was made aware of the existence of
    the report by Mr. Ritchie who requested the Inspector to order production
    of the report.  When in-house counsel learned of this request, he advised
    the Inspector that the report was privileged and he took no steps to require
    production.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[12]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    MOL investigation under the Inspector was completed in June 2002.  On December
    19, 2002, the Inspector swore informations against Bruce Power, Troy Ritchie
    (no relation to Ian Ritchie) and John Burley alleging breaches of the <i>OHSA</i>.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[13]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    trial of the charges was scheduled to proceed in March 2004 but was adjourned
    to November 15, 2004.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[14]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>On
    April 29, 2004, the Inspector, in the company of Crown counsel, from the
    MOL, responsible for prosecuting the charges, attended the home of Mr. Ritchie.  During
    the course of that meeting, counsel for the Crown and the Inspector came
    into possession of a copy of the report, which Mr. Ritchie had undertaken
    to destroy.  In the proceedings before the justice of the peace, she was
    unable to conclude whether Mr. Ritchie volunteered the document or whether
    Crown counsel and the Inspector requested it.  What is clear from the findings
    of fact of the justice of the peace is that the Inspector was fully aware,
    since early 2002, that the document was subject to a claim of privilege.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[15]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appellants became aware that the report was in the possession of the Crown
    in May 2004 when Crown counsel sent a copy to counsel for the appellants
    as part of the Crown’s continuing disclosure obligations.  Counsel for the
    appellants immediately wrote to Crown counsel to voice her objection to the
    Crown’s having come into possession of the report for which privilege was
    claimed.  Further correspondence was exchanged between Crown and defence
    counsel on this issue.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[16]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    a letter dated July 16, 2004, addressed to defence counsel, Crown counsel
    advised that when she and the Inspector were at Mr. Ritchie’s house on April
    29, Mr. Ritchie produced the report in response to questions they asked.  She
    further stated: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>However, once we saw the report we did ask for a
    copy and Mr. Ritchie complied with our request by giving us his copy.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[17]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>What
    is also clear from the correspondence between the Crown and defence counsel
    is that counsel for the Crown intended to tender the draft report in evidence
    at trial.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[18]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for the Crown also disclosed the report to counsel for Vipond Inc.  Vipond
    Inc. had been charged with offences under the <i>OHSA</i> and counsel for
    the Crown initially intended to use the report in an attempt to re-open the
    trial against Vipond, which had already concluded with judgment under reserve.  Ultimately,
    she decided not to pursue that course.</p>
  <h2>THE MOTION FOR A STAY OF PROCEEDINGS</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[19]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Counsel
    for the appellants brought a motion for a stay of proceedings before Justice
    of the Peace S. Woodworth which commenced on November 15, 2004.  Counsel
    for the Crown provided to the court a list of witnesses that she intended
    to call at trial which included Inspector Martin, Mr. Ritchie, four workers
    employed by Vipond Inc. and four workers employed by Bruce Power.  Crown
    counsel indicated that she intended to subpoena the persons whose names appeared
    on the face of the report for the purpose of trial.  More importantly, counsel
    for the Crown advised that she would call Mr. Ritchie and the Inspector as
    witnesses on the motion.  Crown counsel also questioned whether it would
    be necessary for her to go into the witness box on the motion.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[20]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    spite of the express intention to call at least Mr. Ritchie and the Inspector
    on the motion, counsel for the Crown ultimately decided not to do so.  </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[21]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    stay motion proceeded in two phases.  The first phase addressed the issue
    of whether the report was privileged and, if so, whether the privilege had
    been waived.  The second phase addressed the issue of whether this was a
    case for a stay of proceedings based upon abuse of process by the Crown.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[22]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    justice of the peace delivered her decision on the privilege issue on March
    23, 2005.  The justice of the peace observed that the report “does not contain
    within it any legal strategy or thoughts or opinions of legal counsel.”  She
    described the report as “primarily informational in its content.”  However,
    in her subsequent reasons in the second phase she also said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The report clearly sets out items that could well
    be used to the disadvantage and prejudice of the defendants in these pro-ceedings
    and were intended to be privileged.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[23]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    her review of the evidence, the justice of the peace said:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>It is clear from the evidence presented that both
    Mr. Martelli [in-house counsel] and Ms. Fields [outside counsel] continually
    stressed with the members of the Investigative Team that the report was being
    prepared in anticipation of litigation and was privileged, and not to be
    released to anyone outside of the legal department or the Investigative Team.  The
    evidence disclosed that Mr. Martelli went so far as to attend a meeting in
    order to explain the meaning of the document being prepared in anticipation
    of litigation and the privilege that would attach to it.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[24]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    justice of the peace concluded that the report was subject to both solicitor-client
    and litigation privilege.  She also concluded that the privilege had not
    been waived.  As a result, she ordered that the Crown return the original
    report obtained from Mr. Ritchie, any copies that had been made of the report
    and any notes that related to the contents of the report.  The issue of whether
    the appellants were entitled to a stay of proceedings was put over to another
    day. </p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[25]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>In
    the second phase of the stay motion, counsel for the appellants framed the
    abuse of process argument on alleged breaches of ss. 7, 8 and 11 of the <i>Charter
    of Rights and Freedoms</i> in respect of the two individuals and ss. 8 and
    11 in respect of Bruce Power Inc.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[26]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    justice of the peace delivered her judgment in respect of abuse of process
    and a stay of proceedings on February 17, 2006.  The justice of the peace
    made the following findings of fact in respect of the conduct of the representatives
    of the Crown:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>(i)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    undisputed evidence presented during the course of the privilege application
    established that Inspector Martin was aware of the existence of the report
    as far back as early 2002.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>(ii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    in-house counsel for Bruce Power gave uncontra-dicted evidence that the Inspector
    agreed that the report was privileged and took no steps to order disclosure.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>(iii)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Inspector was present at the time the report was obtained from Mr. Ritchie
    and it is clear that not only was he aware the draft report existed, he was
    aware of the claim of privilege made by Bruce Power.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>(iv)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    Crown had taken no steps to limit access to the report and had provided no
    evidence that it had not used the report to assist in preparing the case
    against the appellants at trial.</p>

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>[The replacement Crown] appeared to concede that

    the peace noted: </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>There was a clear indication that some of the statements
    that he gave may well have been self-incriminating, and were provided, on
    the basis that those statements would be subject to solicitor-client and/or
    litigation privilege and would never be disclosed except to parties acting

    exclude the use of the report at trial.  However, it would not be possible
    to discern whether a witness’s knowledge of the report provided the basis
    for his or her evidence:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>There is evidence before this court that the prosecution
    not only reviewed and retained the privileged document in question for a
    lengthy period, but that the prosecution was well aware of the value of that
    document to their case and the prejudice of that document to the defendants.  Although
    this court is aware of the contents of the document and may be able to curtail
    its use in the trial proper it is apparent that other persons who will be
    called to give evidence have had possession of and reviewed the document
    in question.  It would seem to be a situation where it will not be possible
    for the court to make a determination in some instances whether the knowledge
    of the document specifically forms the basis for the evidence being presented.</p>

    justice of the peace further observed that the new counsel for the Crown
    had given an assurance that he had not discussed the case with the original
    Crown.  However, the justice of the peace concluded that “there is no accurate
    indication that the knowledge of the contents of [the report] have not been
    used in the preparation of the prosecution of this matter.”</p>

    respect of the appropriate remedy, the justice of the peace concluded as
    follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>All the defendants in this case have the right to
    a fair trial and the right to make full answer and defense, which includes
    the right to retain and instruct legal counsel in private.  Those rights
    have been infringed by the actions of the prosecution in this case.  Having
    regard to the evidence there is a real risk of prejudice and a strong inference
    that the fair trial rights of all of the defendants have been fundamentally
    and irremediably prejudiced.  Any steps that the court might take to alleviate
    the prejudice short of a stay will in my opinion not be sufficient in the
    circumstances of this particular case to adequately remedy the violation
    of the defendant’s fair trial interests. … </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>There is every indication that the prejudice caused
    by the abuse will be manifested, perpetuated, or aggravated by the conduct
    or outcome of the trial, and no other remedy is reasonably capable of removing
    that prejudice.  As a result the charges against the individual defendants
    Troy Ritchie and John Burley and the corporate defendant Bruce Power Inc.

  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Solicitor-client privilege is fundamental to the
    proper func-tioning of our legal system.  The complex of rules and procedures
    is such that, realistically speaking, it cannot be navigated without a lawyer’s
    expert advice.  It is said that anyone who represents himself or herself
    has a fool for a client, yet a lawyer’s advice is only as good as the factual
    information the client provides.  Experience shows that people who have a
    legal problem will often not make a clean breast of the facts to a lawyer
    without an assurance of confidentiality “as close to absolute as possible”:</p>

  <h2>THE QUESTIONS FOR THE COURT</h2>
  <h2 style='text-align:justify;'>(i)        When the Crown has come into possession
    of a defence document that is protected by solicitor-client and litigation
    privilege, does the accused bear the burden of proving actual prejudice or
    will prejudice be presumed?</h2>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[52]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    answer to this question is clearly found in the reasons for judgment of Binnie
    J. in <i>Celanese Canada Inc. v. Murray Demolition Corp.</i>, [2006] 2 S.C.R.
    189, at para. 3:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>This Court’s decision in <i>MacDonald Estate v.
      Martin</i>, [1990] 3 S.C.R. 1235, makes it clear that prejudice will be
      presumed to flow from an opponent’s access to relevant solicitor-client
      confidences.  The major difference between the minority and majority in
      that case is that while the majority considered the presumption of risk
      of prejudice open to rebuttal in some circumstances (pp. 1260-61), the
      minority would not have permitted even the opportunity of rebuttal (p.
      1266).</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[53]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><i>Celanese</i> involved
    the execution of an <i>Anton Piller</i> order that resulted in documents
    of the defendants, which were protected by solicitor-client privilege, falling
    into the hands of the lawyers for the plaintiffs.  Binnie J. distinguished
    the case from the “moving solicitor” situation in <i>MacDonald Estate</i>.  He
    discussed the kind of rebuttal evidence that would be expected from the party
    who obtained improper access to the privileged documents at para. 4.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The <i>Anton Piller</i> situation is somewhat different
    because the searching solicitors ought to have a record of exactly what was
    seized and what material, for which confidentiality is claimed, they subsequently
    looked at.  Here again, rebuttal should be permitted, but the rebuttal evidence
    should require the party who obtained access to disclose to the court what
    has been learned and the measures taken to avoid the presumed resulting prejudice.  While
    all solicitor confidences are not of the same order of importance, the party
    who obtained the wrongful access is not entitled to have the court assume
    in its favour that such disclosure carried no risk of prejudice to its opponent,
    and therefore does not justify the removal of the solicitors.  For the reasons
    that follow, I conclude, contrary to the view taken by the Court of Appeal,
    with respect, that Celanese and its lawyers <i>did</i> have the onus to rebut
    the presumption of a risk of prejudice and they failed to do so.  [Emphasis
    in original.]</p>

style='"Times New Roman"'>[54]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><i>Celanese</i> involved
    the removal of the solicitors for the plaintiffs from the case.  That said,
    I see no difference in principle between the situations in <i>MacDonald Estate</i> and <i>Celanese</i> and
    the case at bar.</p>

    for the Crown in this court sought to distinguish <i>Celanese</i> on the
    basis that it was a civil case in which the appellants were “attempting to
    utilize a civil onus to achieve a criminal result”.  I reject this submission.  In
    my view, the above cases support the proposition that when the Crown comes
    into possession of a defence document that is protected by solicitor-client
    and litigation privilege, prejudice to the defence will be presumed.  The
    presumption, however, is rebuttable.</p>

    is obvious that there is a significant public interest in proceeding to a
    trial of the merits in cases such as this.  A stay of proceedings is the

style='"Times New Roman"'>[57]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>LeBel
    J., writing for the majority in <i>R. v. Regan</i>, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 297,
    at paras. 54, 56 articulated the test for a stay as follows:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Regardless of whether the abuse causes prejudice
    to the accused, because of an unfair trial, or to the integrity of the justice
    system, a stay of proceedings will only be appropriate when two criteria
    are met:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>the
    prejudice caused by the abuse in question will be manifested, perpetuated
    or aggravated through the conduct of the trial, or by its outcome; and</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentSub-Quote><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>no
    other remedy is reasonably capable of removing that prejudice. </p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>The Court’s judgment in <i>Tobiass</i>, at para.
    91, emphasized that the first criterion is critically important.  It reflects
    the fact that a stay of proceedings is a prospective rather than a retroactive
    remedy.  A stay of proceedings does not merely redress a past wrong.  It
    aims to prevent the perpetuation of a wrong that, if left alone, will continue
    to trouble the parties and the community as a whole, in the future.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote align=center style='text-align:center'>…</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>Any likelihood of abuse which will continue to manifest
    itself if the proceedings continue then must be considered in relation to
    possible remedies less drastic than a stay.  Once it is determined that the
    abuse will continue to plague the judicial process, and that no remedy other
    than a stay can rectify the problem, a judge may exercise her or his discretion
    to grant a stay.  [Citation omitted.]</p>

    this point) in <i>Regan</i> at para. 139:</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>I agree with my colleague LeBel J. that the standard
    of review of the trial judge’s decision to grant a remedy under s. 24(1)

    stated by Gonthier J. in <i>Elsom v. Elsom</i>, [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1367, at
    p. 1375, as follows: “[A]n appellate court will be justified in intervening

    course in a different case.  However, given the record before the justice
    of the peace and, in particular, the failure of the Crown to rebut the presumption
    of prejudice, I am not persuaded that she misdirected herself on the appropriate
    test or that her decision is so clearly wrong as to amount to an injustice.  </p>

    I have already said, if the Crown had been able to lead evidence to rebut
    the presumption of prejudice, it would have done so.  To let the trial proceed
    in these circumstances is, in effect, to permit the Crown to have a second
    chance to disprove prejudice when the record to date suggests it is incapable
    of doing so.  </p>

    my view, the appeal judge erred in reversing the decision of the justice
    of the peace.  The appeal judge said her decision would have been different
    had the report contained advice or recommendations of legal counsel.  She
    failed to give any credit to the justice of the peace’s finding that the
    report clearly sets out items that could well be used to the disadvantage
    and prejudice of the appellants.  The appeal judge also gives little or no
    weight to the failure of the Crown to rebut the presumption of prejudice.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[65]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The
    appeal judge said there was no evidence to support the justice of the peace’s
    finding that the Crown failed to limit access to the report except to counsel
    for Vipond.  The fact is that the Crown’s witness list at trial contains
    the names of four employees from Vipond.  There is no evidence as to what
    distribution, if any, was made of the contents of the report by Vipond.  All
    we know is that counsel for Vipond retrieved the report from his client and
    returned it to counsel for Bruce Power.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[66]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>I
    would allow the appeal and restore the stay of the proceedings on the charges
    against the appellants.</p>
  <p class=HeadingNumber><span
style='"Times New Roman"'>[67]<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Finally,
    I return to the two questions raised by this appeal.  In respect of the first
    question, I would conclude that when the Crown has come into possession of
    a defence document that is protected by solicitor-client and litigation privilege,
    prejudice will be presumed.  The presumption is rebuttable by the Crown.  In
    respect of the second question, I would conclude that in such circumstances,
    it does not necessarily follow that the charges should be stayed where a
    lesser remedy can solve the problem.</p>
  <h2>COSTS</h2>

    appellants may make submissions as to costs in writing within 10 days – limited
    to three pages double spaced.  The Crown may make responding submissions
    as to costs within 10 days of the receipt of the appellants’ submissions – limited
    to three pages double spaced.  If necessary, the appellants may then make
    brief reply to the Crown’s costs submissions within three days of the receipt
    of the Crown’s submissions –
    limited to two pages double spaced.</p>
