  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant was injured in a car accident on June 3, 1996. Because he was a
    self-employed businessman he was entitled under the Bill 164, the <i>Statutory
    Accident Benefits Schedule</i> – <i>Accidents After December 31, 1993 and
    Before November 1, 1996 </i>(“<i>SABS”</i>), O.Reg. 776/93 to the <i>Insurance
    Act, </i>R.S.O. 1990, c.I.8, as amended by the <i>Insurance Statute Law Amendment
    Act, 1993, </i>S.O. 1993, c.10, to a weekly income replacement benefit (“IRB”),
    as well as to loss of earning capacity benefits (“LECB”) after 104 weeks.
    The respondent insurer calculated and paid IRBs. Ultimately, after 104 weeks,
    it made an offer of $0 in respect of the LECB. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant then commenced an action in 2001 for a declaration that he was
    entitled to an LECB in an amount calculated in accordance with the Residual
    Earning Capacity Assessment at a Designated Assessment Centre (“REC-DAC”)
    report of January 21, 2000. The respondent counterclaimed for a refund in
    respect of an overpayment of the IRB. Ultimately, the appellant’s counsel
    engaged an accountant to calculate the IRBs and the LECB. The accountant
    discovered that the insurer had made an error in its calculation and payment
    of the IRBs over the entire period by failing to properly take into account
    and pay the statutory minimum IRB. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant then sought to amend his claim in 2006. At the same time, he also
    amended the wording of his claim for a declaration regarding the LECB by
    adding a claim in the prayer for relief for payment of the declared amount
    of the LECB. The respondent pled that both claims were statute-barred.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge agreed that the IRB claim was statute-barred. She found that
    the delivery of the Statement of Defence and Counterclaim constituted a refusal
    to pay any further benefits to the appellant and thus triggered the two-year
    limitation period under s.&nbsp;72(1) of the <i>SABS</i> and s. 281 of the <i>Insurance
    Act</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge awarded pre-judgment interest in accordance with s. 68 of the <i>SABS</i> at
    2 percent per month compounded monthly, but post-judgment interest under
    s.&nbsp;129 of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i> at a lower rate. She did
    not address specifically the limitation issue raised by the respondent in
    respect of the LECB claim. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    our view, the trial judge erred in her conclusion that the appellant’s claim
    for IRBs was statute-barred. It is common ground that neither the appellant,
    nor the insured, nor their respective counsel, were aware of the error in
    calculation of the IRB until 2006 when the appellant’s expert accountant
    discovered it. It is also common ground that the insurer did not intend its
    Statement of Defence and Counterclaim to constitute a refusal to pay the
    minimum IRB component of the IRB claim as it was not aware of the error.
    In those circumstances, the Statement of Defence and Counterclaim could not
    constitute a refusal to pay an amount claimed or benefit claimed within the
    meaning of s. 72(1) of the <i>SABS</i> and s. 281 of the <i>Insurance Act</i>,
    or to meet the requirements of such a refusal as set out in <i>Smith v. Co-operators
    General Insurance Co</i>., [2002] 2 S.C.R. 129.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    also agree with the appellant that the trial judge erred by failing to award
    post-judgment interest in accordance with s. 68 of the <i>SABS</i>. That
    section is worded in a non-discretionary manner and there is no basis not
    to apply it to post-judgment as well as to pre-judgment interest. Consequently,
    s. 129(5) of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i> makes s. 129 inapplicable,
    therefore ousting the discretion referred to in s. 130 of the <i>Courts of
    Justice Act</i>. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not accept the cross-appellant’s argument that the original claim for
    declatory relief in respect of the LECB did not include a claim for monetary
    recovery. The prayer for relief included a claim for interest and the declaration
    was for an amount calculated in accordance with the findings of the REC-DAC
    report dated January 21, 2000. In our view, it was therefore clear that a
    claim for payment was subsumed in the original claim and is therefore not
    statute barred: see <i>Harrison v. Antonopoulos</i> (2002), 62 O.R. (3d)
    463 (S.C.). </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    the result, the appeal is allowed and the cross-appeal is dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Costs
    of the appeal are awarded to the appellant in respect of the appeal and cross-appeal
    in the amount of $20,582.20, inclusive of disbursements and G.S.T., which
    is on the partial indemnity scale.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Any
    required adjustments of the costs of the trial based on the result in this
    court are to be determined by the trial judge, if the parties cannot agree.</p>
