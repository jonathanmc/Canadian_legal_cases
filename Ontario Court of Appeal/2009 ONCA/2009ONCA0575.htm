    underlying application in this case involves a dispute between the parties
    as to the proper division of assets following the breakdown of their marriage
    over two years ago.  The appellant appeals the order of Paisley J., dated
    April 14, 2009, in which he ordered the division of assets, as well as two
    related orders of Backhouse J., dated April 2, 2009 and Ferrier J., dated
    April 9, 2009. </p>

    appellant brings two motions related to these three appeals.  On the first
    motion, the appellant seeks a stay of the order of Paisley J. pending appeal.  On
    the second motion, she seeks an extension of time to perfect her appeal of
    Paisley J.’s order, and an order consolidating the hearing of that appeal
    with her appeals from the orders of Backhouse J. and Ferrier J.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Facts</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    parties were married in
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      India</st1:country-region>
    in 1990 and have three children.  In addition to the matrimonial home, they
    own a second residence in
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario, as well as a restaurant known as India Paan House.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    parties’ marriage broke down over two years ago, and the respondent brought
    an application to have the assets properly divided.  A preservation order
    was made by Perkins J. on July 8, 2008.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant failed to file an answer or financial statement in response to
    the application.  As a result, an uncontested trial in the matter was initially
    scheduled to proceed on February 17, 2009.  Shortly before the date set for
    trial, the appellant appointed new counsel to represent her. As a result,
    Harvison Young J. granted an adjournment of the trial until April 6, 2009.  She
    ordered that the appellant be allowed to file her answer by March 17, 2009,
    provided that the appellant pay all outstanding costs orders against her.   On
    March 17, 2009, Allen J. adjourned the appellant’s motion to have Harvison
    Young J.’s order set aside until April 9, 2009, three days after the trial
    was scheduled to proceed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    April 2, 2009, Backhouse J. set aside the order of Allen J. and ordered that,
    if the appellant complied with the costs order of Harvison Young J., her
    answer and financial statement could still be filed.  On April 9, 2009, the
    appellant moved before Ferrier J. to have Harvison Young J.’s order set aside
    in its entirety.  Ferrier J. ruled that the motion was <i>res judicata</i> by
    virtue of the order made by Backhouse J.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant drafted a Notice of Appeal to the

w:st="on">

    Divisional Court, seeking to appeal the orders of Backhouse J. and Ferrier

'>[1]</span></span></span></a>  At this point, there remained outstanding costs
    orders against the appellant and she was not able to file her answer or financial
    statement.  The uncontested trial proceeded before Paisley J. on April 14,
    2009. He made the following order:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Judgment

  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Title
    to the matrimonial home to vest in the appellant once payment to the respondent
    for his share of the property is paid.
     Failing payment to the respondent, the matrimonial home be sold and the
    proceeds be payable to the respondent to the extent necessary to satisfy
    the equalization order;</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Title
    to the second property, located at 113 Hiawatha Rd., to vest in the respondent,
    including the sole exclusive right to collect all rents therefrom, subject
    to any rights of mortgages; and </p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><span style='font-family:Symbol;
'>·<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>The

  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    April 16, 2009, Paisley J. also made a non-harassment order, prohibiting
    the appellant from approaching the respondent, India Paan House, and the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Hiawatha Rd. property within 50 meters.  The order was to expire on April
    30, 2009 unless extended by the judge presiding at the hearing on that date.  That
    hearing was adjourned and the order remains in effect until the new hearing
    date.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    May 1, 2009, the appellant filed three appeals in the Court of Appeal: (1)
    from the order of Paisley J., dated April 14, 2009; (2) from the order of
    Backhouse J.; and (3) from the order of Ferrier J.  None of the appeals have
    been perfected, and the appeals from the orders of Backhouse J. and Ferrier
    J. are on the list to be purged pending the outcome of this motion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>On
    June 12, 2009, the appellant moved before Gillese J.A. for a stay of Paisley
    J.’s order, the consolidation of the three appeals and an extension of time
    to perfect them.  Gillese J.A. granted an adjournment of the motion to allow
    the respondent to file responding materials.  On June 24, 2009, Goudge J.A.
    adjourned the motions because the respondent had filed his materials too
    late for them to be properly considered by the appellant.  The terms of the
    adjournment granted by Goudge J.A. were, pending the motion to stay, that
    no further steps be taken by the respondent to implement Paisley J.’s order;
    that the respondent continue to pay, on consent, child support in the amount
    of $600.00 per month; and that no action be taken to dismiss the underlying
    appeal.  Goudge J.A. also ordered that the closing of the Hiawatha property
    be allowed to proceed and that no further material be filed in the motions
    without leave of the court.</p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Analysis</span></h4>
  <h3><i><span style='font-weight:normal'>Motion to stay Paisley J.’s order</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    order to succeed on this motion, the appellant must show that: (1) there
    is a serious question to be determined on the appeal; (2) she will suffer
    irreparable harm if the stay is not granted; and (3) on a balance of convenience
    analysis, the appellant would suffer greater harm if the stay is not granted
    than the respondent will suffer if the stay is granted.  This is the same
    as the test for an interlocutory injunction: see <i>Circuit World Corp. v.
    Lesperance et al.</i> <span style='color:windowtext;text-decoration:none;text-underline:
none'>(1997), 33 O.R. (3d) 674</span> (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
  ) at 676-677. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant has not met this burden.  Even if I assume that her appeal of Paisley
    J.’s order raises a serious question to be determined, I cannot conclude
    that she will suffer irreparable harm if a stay is not granted.  I am also
    unable to conclude that the balance of convenience weighs in her favour.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant submits that she is receiving social assistance and that her only
    source of income to support herself and her children flows from her work
    at India Paan House.  She claims that she is now in dire financial circumstances
    and will be further burdened if Paisley J.’s order is not stayed.
     I have no doubt that Paisley J.’s order has placed the appellant in a difficult
    financial situation.  However, there is some affidavit evidence to suggest
    that the appellant has opened a competing restaurant across the street from
    India Paan House in her sister’s name, and that she has paid the first and
    last month’s rent on these premises.  Further, I note that pursuant to Goudge
    J.A.’s order and on consent, the respondent has been paying the appellant
    $600.00 per month in child support.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant has not presented any evidence in her motion record to convince
    me that any harm flowing to her from Paisley J.’s order cannot be quantified
    in monetary terms or cured by an award of damages.  On this basis, I cannot
    conclude that the appellant will suffer irreparable harm if the stay is not
    granted.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent also claims to be in dire financial circumstances.  I recognize
    that the evidence with respect to the appellant’s alleged new restaurant
    operation has not been tested on cross-examination and is contested.  Nevertheless,
    I accepted it for purposes of the respondent’s cross-motion for security
    for costs and dismissed that motion.
     On the evidence presented, therefore, I cannot conclude that the balance
    of convenience weighs in favour of the appellant.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion to stay the order of Paisley J., dated April 14, 2009, is dismissed.  The
    respondent shall continue, on consent, to pay child support in the amount
    of $600.00 per month to the appellant pending determination of the appeal. </p>
  <h3><i><span style='font-weight:normal'>Motion for Extension of Time and Consolidation
        of Appeals</span></i></h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant seeks an order consolidating her appeal from the order of Paisley
    J. with the appeals from the orders of Backhouse J. and Ferrier J.  She also
    seeks an extension of time to perfect all three appeals.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    orders of Backhouse J. and Ferrier J. are clearly interlocutory.  Pursuant
    to s. 19(1)(b) of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, R.S.O. 1990, c. C.43,
    an appeal from an interlocutory order of a judge of the Superior Court of
    Justice lies to the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court with leave.  The appellant has not obtained leave to appeal
    with respect to these two orders.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
    the appellant has not been granted leave to appeal these orders in the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court, s. 6(2) of the <i>Courts of Justice Act</i>, which confers
    jurisdiction on this court to hear and determine an appeal that lies to the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    Divisional Court if an appeal in the same proceeding is also commenced in

    <st1:Street
w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court should have been served by the appellant within seven days
    of the orders being made: see rule 62.02(2) of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i>.  The
    appellant can no longer appeal those orders.  This court cannot short circuit
    the leave process by joining these appeals to the appeal of Paisley J.’s
    final order in this court.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>With
    respect to the extension of time to perfect the appeal from Paisley J.’s
    order, the appellant has indicated that transcripts from the trial will be
    available by August 28, 2009.  I therefore grant the motion and extend the
    time to perfect the appeal from Paisley J.’s order until September 28, 2009.   </p>
  <h4><span lang=EN-US>Conclusion</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motions to stay the order of Paisley J. and to consolidate the three appeals
    are dismissed.  The motion for an extension of time to perfect the appeal
    of Paisley J.’s order is granted to September 28, 2009.  The respondent shall,
    on consent, continue to pay child support to the appellant in the amount
    of $600.00 per month, pending the outcome of the appeal. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>I
    note that the respondent brought a motion for security for costs, which was
    dismissed with the following endorsement given orally:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Rule 61.06(1)(a) of the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i> provides
    that an order for security for costs may be made against an appellant where
    there is good reason to believe that the appeal is frivolous and vexatious
    and the appellant has insufficient assets in Ontario to pay the costs of
    the appeal.  I am not satisfied that the appeal appears to be frivolous and
    vexatious.  The trial judge refused to grant the appellant an adjournment
    until her appeals were heard by the
    <st1:Street w:st="on">
    <st1:address w:st="on">
    Divisional Court.  This raises an issue as to whether the appellant’s right
    to a fair trial was breached.  Additionally, the trial judge made no award
    for child support for the three children who are living with the appellant

    Ontario to pay a costs award as it is conceded that she spent over $30,000

    the respondent was unsuccessful on his cross-motion also heard this day,
