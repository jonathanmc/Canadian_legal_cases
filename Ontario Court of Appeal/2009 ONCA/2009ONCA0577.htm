  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant appeals his conviction by a jury of sexual assault and his sentence
    to 4½ years in custody followed by two years of probation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant had sexual intercourse with his 18-year old niece who was living
    with his family temporarily.  At trial, the sole issue was consent.  He testified
    that the complainant had consented to the sexual intercourse.  The theory
    of the Crown was that the complainant, after drinking heavily, was either
    so drunk she was not aware of what was happening to her or that she lacked
    the capacity to consent.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appellant abandoned the ground of unreasonable verdict set out in his notice
    of appeal, but raises four other grounds.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>At
    the outset, we note that this was a relatively short trial and that at no
    time did defence counsel raise or object to any of the issues upon which
    the appellant relies on appeal.  While not determinative of the merit of
    any of the grounds of appeal, the failure to object is of particular moment
    in this case given that defence counsel had several occasions to raise issues
    with the trial judge concerning the charge; during the pre-charge conference,
    when the trial judge provided counsel with copies of the charge before he
    gave it, and at the conclusion of the charge.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>First,
    counsel for the appellant submits that the trial judge failed to fully explain
    the defence position to the jury.  For example, she submits that the trial
    judge should have reviewed the evidence of the complainant that the defence
    relied on to suggest she was trying to deflect blame from her.  Counsel identified,
    as an example, a series of email between the complainant and the appellant’s
    wife the day following the alleged assault.  We disagree.  The trial judge
    more than adequately presented the theory of the defence to the jury.  It
    was within his discretion to decide the extent to which to review the evidence.  We
    would not give effect to this ground of appeal.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Second,
    appellant’s counsel submitted that the Crown, in closing, invited the jury
    to speculate that the complainant may have moved while she was completely
    passed out or sleeping, and that the trial judge not only failed to caution
    the jury to disregard the Crown’s submission but also compounded the error
    by repeating the submission in his summary of the Crown’s case.  This presented
    to the jury a mechanism to reconcile the complainant’s testimony that she
    was dead drunk during the sexual intercourse with the testimony of her aunt
    that she was awake.  We do not accept that the Crown’s submission or the
    trial judge’s instruction invited the jury to engage in baseless speculation.  Rather,
    it was permissible for the jury, using their collective life experience,
    to consider whether the complainant might have moved in the condition that
    the jury found her to be in, based on the testimony of all witnesses.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Third,
    counsel submits that the trial judge erred by giving the jury instructions
    that went beyond the standard <i><span style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New Roman"'>W.D.</span></i> charge.  After
    giving what the appellant recognizes as model <i><span
style='font-family:"Times New \(W1\)";"Times New Roman"'>W. D.</span></i> instructions,
    the trial judge told the jury that it was not their task to decide whether
    they believed the complainant, that if they disbelieved her they must acquit
    the appellant, and that even if they believed her evidence they had to go
    on to consider whether her testimony together with all of the rest of the
    evidence satisfied them beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was
    guilty of sexual assault.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    do not accept this submission.  The trial judge’s additional instruction
    did not undermine the <i>W.D.</i> instruction. Rather, the additional instruction
    emphasized to the jury that they had to consider all of the evidence in determining
    whether the Crown had proven its case beyond a reasonable doubt.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Fourth,
    counsel submits that the trial judge’s limiting instruction with regard to
    the appellant’s morally reprehensible conduct had the effect of highlighting
    that conduct.  She submits he should simply have told the jury that the appellant’s
    conduct in having sex with his niece and cheating on his wife is generally
    frowned upon and they should not punish him for this misbehaviour.  We do
    not agree.  The trial judge clearly instructed the jury not to allow the
    appellant’s discreditable conduct to affect their analysis of the key issues
    in the case.  We see nothing wrong with the instruction he gave. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal of conviction is dismissed.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    regard to the sentence appeal, the Crown concedes that the probation order
    in the sentence is illegal.  We grant leave to appeal sentence and set aside
    the probation order.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Crown also concedes that the trial judge misapprehended the length of sentence
    imposed on the appellant on his earlier dated convictions for sexual assault
    and forcible confinement.  The trial judge’s reasons make clear he took into
    account the length of those sentences in gauging the seriousness of his prior
    record.  This significant misapprehension is an error that allows us to reassess
    the fitness of the sentence and impose the sentence we think appropriate.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    trial judge regarded the appropriate sentence to be 4 ½ yrs in custody and
    he allowed 4 months for the time the appellant was in custody before trial.  In
    determining a fit sentence, we agree with the trial judge that specific and
    general deterrence are the paramount sentencing principles.  With this in
    mind and noting the aggravating factors as well as the mitigating factors
    the trial judge identified, we would set aside that sentence and replace
    it with a sentence of 3 years less 4 months time served.</p>
