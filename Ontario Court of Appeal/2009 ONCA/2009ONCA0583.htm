lang=EN-US>By the Court:</span></h4>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge allowed the respondent’s summary judgment motion because she
    found clause 11.16 of the pension plan to be clear and unambiguous. On her
    interpretation, a physician is appointed as an independent referee under
    that clause to determine “whether the Member is … Totally and Permanently
    Disabled” within the meaning of the plan.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>We
    take a different view. Clause 11.16 provides:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>11.16  Medical Appeals Process</b></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>If a:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(1)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Member’s
    application for accrual of Contributory Service under Section 11.3, or payment
    of a disability retirement pension under Section 11.6; or</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(2)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Disabled
    member’s continued accrual of Contributory Service; or</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>(3)<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Retired
    Member’s continued payment of a disability retirement pension,</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>is rejected after all available medical evidence
    and any required tests and assessments have been reviewed by the Administrator,
    the Member may appeal and request that an independent medical referee be
    appointed by the Administrator and the attending physician to resolve any
    dispute that may have arisen between the qualified physician appointed on
    behalf of the Administrator and the Member’s attending physician. The independent
    medical referee shall examine the Member’s medical evidence and any required
    tests or assessments, and make the determination as to whether the Member
    is Partially Disabled, Totally Disabled or Totally and Permanently Disabled,
    as applicable. The medical referee’s determination shall be final and conclusive
    and binding on both parties.</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>The Member must advise the Administrator within
    60 days of receipt of the letter from the Administrator rejecting the application
    for disability retirement or continued accrual of Contributory Service, that
    she wishes to appeal and request that an independent medical referee be appointed.
    At the discretion of the Administrator, the time limit may be extended in
    the case of extenuating circumstances.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>A
    basic principle of contract interpretation is that all of the contract’s
    terms must be given meaning. An interpretation that renders a term of the
    contract meaningless is to be avoided.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    respondent focuses on the wording in clause 11.16:  “The independent medical
    referee shall examine the Member’s medical evidence and any required tests
    or assessments, and make the determination as to whether the Member is … Totally
    and Permanently Disabled …. The medical referee’s determination shall be
    final and conclusive and binding on both parties”, and submits that the role
    of the independent referee is to revisit the entire question whether the
    member is “totally and permanently disabled”. We disagree. Such an interpretation
    would render meaningless the term of clause 11.16 that the independent referee
    is appointed to resolve the dispute between the plan physician and the member’s
    physician. The entire clause, when read as a whole, means that the independent
    referee’s opinion as to whether the member is “totally and permanently disabled” must
    flow from his or her resolution of the dispute between the plan physician
    and the member’s physician. The scheme of the plan and the characterization
    of the process under clause 11.16 as an “Appeal” confirm this interpretation.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    scheme of the appeal process under the plan is that if the two physicians,
    one for the member and one for the plan, agree on an issue, it is accepted
    for the purposes of determining eligibility for a pension. To the extent
    that the two disagree on an issue, then a third, independent physician is
    appointed effectively to break the tie by resolving the dispute between them.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    way the application judge has interpreted the provision, the third physician’s
    opinion on an issue would be determinative, even if it disagrees with the
    other two. This is not consistent with either the wording of the appeal provision,
    or with the concept of an appeal process.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    plan defines “Totally and Permanently Disabled” as follows:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote><b>2.24 “Total and Permanent Disability”</b> means,
    as determined based on the advice of a legally qualified medical doctor in
    Canada or where the member resides, a medical condition causing a physical
    or mental impairment that prevents the member from engaging in any employment
    and that can reasonably be expected to continue for the remainder of the
    member’s lifetime. <b>“Totally and Permanently Disabled”</b> has a corresponding
    meaning.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the appellant provided as part of her application for a disability
    pension, a full opinion letter from her physician, Dr. Ogilvie-Harris, which
    concluded that she was totally and permanently disabled.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    plan advised her by letter of January 27, 2005 that the plan physician had
    concluded that she was indeed totally disabled, but the physician was not
    satisfied that her condition was permanent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Therefore,
    the dispute between the two was whether the appellant’s total disability
    was permanent. Whether she was totally disabled was not in dispute.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>However,
    after following the process for choosing the independent medical referee,
    the plan administrator did not advise the referee that the dispute was whether
    the appellant’s condition was permanent, but instead asked him to determine
    whether the appellant was totally and permanently disabled. Furthermore,
    it does not appear that the referee was provided with the opinion of the
    plan’s physician.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In
    this case, the independent referee concluded that the appellant’s disability
    was not total, without addressing why he disagreed on that issue with either
    Dr. Ogilvie-Harris or the plan’s physician. However, he did conclude that
    her condition was not going to improve i. e., it was permanent.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Because
    the plan administrator did not ask the independent medical referee to provide
    an opinion in accordance with the relevant contractual provision, there is
    a genuine issue for trial as to the consequence of that failure and the remedy
    available for the member.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    appeal is therefore allowed and the summary judgment order is set aside.
    Costs of the appeal are to the appellant, fixed at $9,634.66. The parties
    have agreed that the amount of the costs ordered on the application would
    be payable to the successful party on the appeal. So ordered.</p>
