    <st1:address
 w:st="on">
    188 Eglinton Avenue East, by the registration on May 16, 1999 of the declaration
    required by the legislation in effect at the time, the <i>Condominium Act</i>,
    R.S.O. 1990, c.26, (the <i>Act</i>). </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>These
      issues are:</span></p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>1.        Whether the respondent Lomico 188 Inc.
    (Lomico), the owner of part of the building, whose interest was held by the
    respondent 188 Eglinton Inc. (Eglinton) as a bare trustee, is a “declarant” for
    the purposes of the <i>Act</i>.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>2.        Whether the lease under which the respondent
    S-99 Limited (S-99) purports to lease to the appellant (MTCC 1250) certain
    central heating, ventilating and air conditioning equipment (the HVAC equipment)
    that are said by MTCC 1250 to be part of the common elements of the condominium,
    is null and void.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>3.        Whether the respondents Eglinton, Lomico,
    and 188 Lofts Inc. (Lofts) breached the terms of the agreements of purchase
    and sale of the condominium units by failing to carry out repairs to the
    underground garage.</p>
  <p class=DoubleIndentQuote>4.        Whether Eglinton and Lomico breached the
    agreements of purchase and sale of the condominium units by failing to rent
    a parking space at market rates to each unit owner.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

      trial judge answered no to the first question, yes to the second question,
      no to the third question, and yes to the fourth question.  MTCC 1250 appeals
      the answers to the first three questions.  The Eglinton and Lomico cross
      appeal the answer to the fourth question.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

      will address each of these issues in turn.  In each instance it will be
      necessary to refer to the facts that are particularly relevant to that
      issue. To begin, however, a general review of the factual circumstances,
      none of which are significantly disputed, may be helpful.</span></p>
  <h3>II.        BACKGROUND</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      building in question, 188 Eglinton Avenue East in Toronto, was constructed
      in the late 1970s as a commercial building with retail facilities on the
      ground floor and two floors of underground parking for tenants and visitors.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      1997, the respondent Mastercraft Group Inc. (Mastercraft) entered into
      an agreement to purchase the building in order to convert it to a condominium.  Mastercraft
      incorporated three companies, Eglinton, Lofts, and Lomico to carry out
      this project.  Before the purchase closed, Mastercraft assigned its interest
      in the agreement to Eglinton, which took title to the building on May 22,
      1997.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Lofts
      and Lomico each immediately entered into agreements with Eglinton whereby
      Eglinton held the underground parking floors, the ground floor with its
      retail facilities, and the eighth floor, in trust for Lomico and floors
      two to seven in trust for Lofts.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Lofts
      carried out renovations on floors two to seven and began marketing the
      resulting residential units to purchasers in 1997. The first unit owners
      took possession in November 1998.  By that point, although work on the
      conversion was still going on, all of the building systems, including heating,
      ventilation and air conditioning, were operational.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
      May 16, 1999, Eglinton registered the declaration and description of the
      condominium, as required by the <i>Act</i>.  Pursuant to the <i>Act</i>,
      that created the appellant condominium corporation (MTCC 1250) and divided
      the freehold in the building into units and common elements.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      respondent Greenberg was the principal of Mastercraft and controlled Eglinton,
      Lofts, and Lomico. He, his accountant and another associate constituted
      the board of directors of MTCC 1250from its inception on May 16, 1999 to
      July 22, 1999, when the turnover meeting required by the <i>Act</i> was
      held, and a new board of three unit owners was elected.  Within a few months,
      the disputes began between the MTCC 1250 and the respondents that ultimately
      led to this litigation.</span></p>

  <h3>III.       ANALYSIS</h3>
  <h3>1.         The Declarant Issue</h3>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      first issue is whether Lomico is a “declarant” for the purposes of the <i>Act</i> and
      therefore is fixed with the statutory obligations of a declarant. </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The <i>Act</i> provides
      a statutory definition of “declarant”.  While it is true that the <i>Act </i>was
      repealed and replaced on May 5, 2001 by the <i>Condominium Act</i>, <i>1998</i>.
      S.O. 1998, c.19 (the new <i>Act</i>) it is not in dispute that its predecessor,
      the Act, applies, and that there are no changes in the new <i>Act</i> that
      affect the action.  The definition in s. 1(1) of the <i>Act</i> is:</span></p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>“declarant”
    means the owner or owners in fee simple of the land described in the description
      at the time of registration of a declaration and description of the land,
      and includes any successor or assignee of such owner or owners but does
      not include a purchaser in good faith of a unit who actually pays fair
      market value or any successor or assignee of such purchaser</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      facts of particular relevance to this issue are as follows.  On the day
      it acquired title to the property at 188 Eglinton Avenue East, namely May
      22, 1997, Eglinton acknowledged its grant of an option to Lomico to “to
      acquire the eighth floor of the property” for $346,000.  On the same day,
      Lomico exercised the option and acquired the eighth floor for that amount.  In
      return, Eglinton acknowledged that from that date it held the eighth floor
      in trust for Lomico.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      chartered accountant who assisted Mastercraft in structuring the entire
      transaction gave evidence that it was critical for tax purposes that Lomico
      own the eighth floor before the registration of the declaration on May
      16, 1999, which is why it purchased that part of the property on May 22,
      1997 for $346,000.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>On
      July 6, 2000, a deed executed on June 29, 2000 by Greenberg was registered
      purporting to transfer the 13 units on the eighth floor from Eglinton to
      Lomico for consideration of $2.00.  However, the accountant’s evidence
      was that on registration of the declaration, Lomico “surrendered its undivided
      interest [in the eighth floor] in exchange for the condominium units”
    and that it was a trade in kind of things of equal value rather than an exchange
    of funds.  He said this was required for tax purposes so that Lomico could
    be said to own that interest in the building all the way through, prior to
    and after registration.  </span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Since
      then Lomico has retained ownership of the units on the eighth floor, renting
      seven of them out as residential units, with the rest being used as offices
      for Greenberg’s companies.  Neither the agreements of purchase and sale
      of the residential units elsewhere in the building nor the disclosure statement
      provided to prospective purchasers disclosed that the declarant intended
      to retain and lease out any specific residential units.  It is clear, however,
      that the eighth floor units have never been offered for sale.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>At
      trial, MTCC 1250 argued, as it does here, that Lomico meets the statutory
      definition of “declarant” and as a declarant is fixed with the accompanying
      statutory obligations.  The main obligation that MTCC 1250 appears to rely
      on is found in s. 51(1)(b) of the <i>Act</i>, which MTCC 1250 says requires
      Lomico to promptly sell the eighth floor units that it has retained.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[18]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      trial judge dismissed MTCC 1250’s claim.  He found that Lomico was a
    “<i>bona fide</i> purchaser for value of the assets involved at fair market
    value”, and therefore was not a declarant, since it fell within the exclusion
    set out in the statutory definition.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[19]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>With
      respect, we do not agree with this reasoning. The statutory definition
      excludes “a purchaser in good faith <u>of a unit</u> who actually pays
      fair market value” (emphasis added).  Here Lomico purchased the eighth
      floor of the building from Eglinton at fair market value when it exercised
      its option on May 22, 1997.  As the evidence made clear, it was important
      for tax purposes that Lomico acquire that part of the property at that
      point, before registration of the declaration.  The transaction was not
      and did not purport to be a purchase by Lomico of the proposed units on
      the eighth floor.  That transaction therefore does not bring Lomico within
      the exclusion.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[20]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Nor
      could the “exchange” on May 16, 1999 serve to do so.  Post registration,
      Lomico could not and did not transfer its pre-registration ownership of
      the eighth floor to anyone “in exchange” for the units on the eighth floor.  No
      one acquired ownership of the eighth floor from Lomico on May 16, 1999.  Nor
      did anyone transfer the units to Lomico in return.  The change of Lomico’s
      ownership of the eighth floor into its ownership of the units on the eighth
      floor cannot qualify as a <i>bona fide</i> purchase of the units on the
      eighth floor at fair market value.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[21]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Rather,
      in assessing whether Lomico meets the statutory definition, the critical
      fact is that at the time of registration of the declaration, Lomico was
      the owner of the full interest in the eighth floor of the building subject
      only to Eglinton’s holding that interest for it as a bare trustee.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[22]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>The
      question is whether that qualifies Lomico as “the owner or owners in fee
      simple” of the eighth floor of the building as set out in the statutory
      definition.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[23]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>In
      our view it does.  The statutory definition must be read in light of the
      objective of the <i>Act </i>and the intention of the Legislature.  Fundamental
      to the purpose of the “declarant” concept in the <i>Act </i>is the objective
      of identifying the true owner or owners of the property at the time of
      registration of the declaration in order to place certain responsibilities
      on them as the property is converted to a condominium under the<i> Act</i>.  The
      meaning of the phrase “the owner or owners in fee simple of the land” must
      be informed by this policy objective even if the result may not exactly

      at the time of registration of the declaration, Lomico was the true owner
      of the eighth floor of the property, subject only to Eglinton’s holding
      that interest in trust as a bare trustee.  In light of the intent of the
      legislation, that qualifies Lomico as an owner in fee simple of the eighth
      floor of the property at the time of registration for the purposes of the
      statutory definition.  If there be any doubt about Lomico’s status as the
      owner of the eighth floor, then certainly, together with Eglinton, which
      holds the eighth floor in trust for it, Lomico and Eglinton are “the owners
      of the fee simple” of that part of the property as that phrase is used
      in the statutory definition, and therefore Lomico as well as Eglinton must

     We disagree.  Prior to registration, such a purchaser holds an interest
    that is different from that of Lomico.  If the condominium project did not
    proceed, Lomico’s ownership of the eighth floor would survive.  The interest
    held by the unit purchasers would not.  Thus, the purchaser of a proposed
    unit cannot be said to be an owner of the fee simple of the property. </span></p>

      of directors of MTCC 1250 and Greenberg, Lomico cancelled the parking privileges
      of the directors who were most involved in the disputes.  Accordingly,
      MTCC 1250, in this action, seeks an order requiring Lomico, Eglinton and

      considering this issue, the trial judge proceeded, at para. 53, on the
      basis that he was entitled to consider all relevant circumstances in attempting
      to make sense of the provisions in these various documents.  In addition
      to reviewing the documents already mentioned, he noted, at para. 54, that
      in order to obtain a building permit, Eglinton was required to undertake
      to the city that a minimum of 82 parking spaces would be provided, 71 for
      residents and 11 for visitors, and, at para. 55, that the “features sheet” provided
      to prospective purchasers indicated that owners would be given priority

      view of these factors, along with the <i>contra proferentem</i> rule, according
      to which an ambiguous term in a contract will be construed against the
      interests of the party who imposed it, the trial judge concluded, at para.
      59, that “[w]hen all of the evidence is considered, the irresistible inference
      to be drawn is that as long as they were prepared to pay market rates,
      a parking space would be available to unit owners.”</span></p>

      his original judgment ordered, at para. 4, “that [Lomico] shall lease available
      parking units to original purchasers of units at MTCC 1250 at market rate…”.
      In the endorsement, he clarified, at para. 9, that in his reasons he decided
      that “a unit owner who is prepared to pay the market rate was entitled
      to a parking space; <i>not</i> that original purchasers prepared to pay
      a market rate were entitled to a parking space” (emphasis in original).
      Accordingly, at para. 10, he amended his judgment to read: “This Court
      declares that [Eglinton] breached the parking agreement by failing to lease
      parking spaces to unit owners of [MTCC 1250] at market rates.”</span></p>

      does not appear to take issue with the trial judge’s finding that each
      original purchaser has such a right.  However, Lomico submits that the
      trial judge fell into error by relying on evidence that applied only to
      original purchasers in concluding that subsequent unit owners were entitled
      to lease a parking space.  To bolster their argument that the trial judge
      should have confined the right to lease a parking spot to original purchasers,
      Lomico and Eglinton also rely on the trial judge’s finding, at para. 49,
      that there was no evidence before him that subsequent purchasers had any
      expectation of an entitlement to parking.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

lang=EN-US>[78]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>  As
      previously mentioned, in interpreting a contract, the court must strive
      to give effect to the reasonable expectations of the parties, taking into
      consideration the words used, the entire contract and the surrounding circumstances.  This
      is precisely what the trial judge did.  In the original agreements of purchase
      and sale, Lofts represented to the original purchasers of units that they
      would be able to lease a parking space at market rates, and in the disclosure
      statement, the declarant represented owners would be entitled to lease
      a parking space.  According to the trial judge, “[t]hat representation
      meant something.”  In other words, the right to lease a parking space was
      part of the consideration in return for the payment of the purchase price
      of each condominium unit.  Turning to the surrounding circumstances, the
      trial judge noted that in order to obtain a building permit the developer
      gave an undertaking to the City of
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Toronto that parking spaces would be available for the condominium owners
    and their guests.  In addition, the promotional features sheet given to prospective
    purchasers represented that secure underground parking would be available
    at market rates, and that unit owners would be given priority for reserved
    spaces.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[79]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>These
      factors support the conclusion that the parties did not intend that the
      right to lease a parking spot would be merely a personal benefit.  Rather,
      it was an appurtenance to each residential unit.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span
lang=EN-US>[80]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>There
      is other evidence capable of supporting this conclusion. All of the relevant
      provisions in the documents refer to “owners” <i>simpliciter</i>, as opposed
      to “original owners”.  Furthermore, pursuant to article 5.1 of the declaration,
      MTCC 1250 was required to repair and maintain the parking units. It would
      not make sense to contemplate an arrangement where, over time, the condominium
      owners would maintain and repair a garage they were not allowed to use.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

      he did not specifically identify the right in issue as an easement, the
      trial judge’s findings of fact and analysis support the conclusion that
      the right to rent a parking spot is an easement appurtenant to each residential
      unit, which Lofts, as agent for Lomico, granted to initial owners of condominium
      units.  Since easements automatically run with the land, it follows that
      the right to rent the parking units is part of what is conveyed from residential
      unit owner to residential unit owner, and we would so declare.</span></p>

      and Lomico submit that the trial judge exceeded his jurisdiction by ordering
      that the market rate be determined by arbitration.  The parties did not
      agree to submit the matter to arbitration, and there is no provision in
      the Act conferring jurisdiction to refer the issue to arbitration. They
      contend that the trial judge was obliged to decide the issue based on the
      evidence before him.</span></p>

      1250 takes what may be referred to as a middle ground.  It admits that
      the <i>Rules of Civil Procedure</i> “do not specifically accord to [judges]
      the right to direct the parties to arbitration”. However, ordering parties
      to arbitrate is analogous to directing a reference and thus an arbitration
      order is available through a combination of Rule 54 and rule 1.04(2). Rule
      54 stipulates the circumstances under which a judge may direct a reference,
      and rule 1.04(2) states, “Where matters are not provided for in these rules,
      the practice shall be determined by analogy to them.” MTCC 1250 goes on
      to suggest that once a judge has ordered parties to arbitrate, they would
      simply utilize the procedures set forth in the <i>Arbitration Act, 1991</i>,
      S.O. 1991, c.17, instead of Rule 55, which sets out the procedure to be
      used on a reference.</span></p>

      problem with this approach is that the <i>Arbitration Act </i>applies to
      an arbitration conducted under an arbitration agreement (except in certain
      circumstances) and to an arbitration conducted in accordance with another
      act: ss. 2(1), 2(2) and 2(3). The parties have not executed an arbitration
      agreement and the Act does not provide for arbitration in this situation.</span></p>

      132(1) and (2) of the Act states that the following agreements will be

      a declarant and a corporation.</span></p>

      agreement in this case is between Eglinton and Lofts, on the one hand,
      and the condominium owners on the other.  Clause 98(1)(b) deals with an
      agreement between an owner and the condominium corporation to make alterations
      to the common elements, and thus is not applicable to this case.  Since
      there is nothing in the evidence to suggest that any of the condominium
      owners are corporations, this section does not apply.</span></p>

lang=EN-US>[88]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span><span lang=EN-US>Section
      134 also provides for arbitration when certain parties seek an order enforcing
      compliance with the Act or various other documents, but only if the mediation
      and arbitration processes described in s. 132 are available.  For the same
