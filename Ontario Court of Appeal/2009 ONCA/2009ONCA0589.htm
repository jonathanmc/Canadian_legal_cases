&quot;Times New Roman&quot;'>Taking into account the observations of
    the investigating police officers, the Crown's case with respect to the
    offences involving the four teenaged girls was overwhelming. The door frame to
    the home was broken and there was a visible pry mark on the door.  Moreover, contrary to the appellant’s claim, the
    officers observed no injuries to the appellant and no damage to his vehicle.
    Considered in this context, there was no air of reality to the appellant's
    version of events, which was introduced by filing a DVD of his testimony at the
    pre-enqu&#7879;te hearing held to determine whether process should issue in the
    appellant’s private complaint against the four teenaged girls. In our view, any
    references by the trial judge to Mr. Wilson's evidence in relation to these
    offences was peripheral to his reasons and we would not interfere with his
    findings on counts 1, 2, 3 and 4.</span></p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;However, we agree that the trial judge made a
    significant error when he referred to the evidence of Mr. Mann as confirming the
    evidence of Mr. Wilson. Mr. Mann did not testify at trial. The trial judge
    evidently confused some of Mr. Wilson's evidence as emanating from Mr.
    Mann.  We are unable to say that the
    trial judge's reliance on the non-existent evidence of Mr. Mann was not an
    essential part of his assessment of Mr.&nbsp;Wilson's evidence. Mr. Wilson's
    evidence was central to the obstruct justice, perjury and fabricating evidence
    offences. The convictions for these offences cannot stand.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;Accordingly, the conviction appeal is allowed in
    part, the convictions for obstructing justice, perjury, and fabricating
    evidence are set aside and a new trial is ordered on counts 5, 6 and 7. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&nbsp;Given that a mixture of concurrent and
    consecutive sentences were imposed with respect to the various offences and
    that we have allowed the conviction appeal in part, it is necessary that we
    revisit the issue of sentence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Having regard to the serious nature of the offences for
    which conviction has been upheld, including the fact that they involved a home invasion,
    in our view, a fit sentence is six months’ imprisonment.  The combination of death threats, forcible
    entry, and the use of a weapon that were present in this case make a
    conditional sentence inappropriate. In the circumstances of this case, a conditional
    sentence would not satisfy the sentencing goals of denunciation and deterrence.
    We would not interfere with the period of probation imposed. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Accordingly, the sentence appeal is allowed, the
    sentence imposed by the trial judge on counts 1, 2, 3, and 4 is set aside, and
    a global sentence of six months imprisonment is substituted with the original
    period of probation to remain </p>
