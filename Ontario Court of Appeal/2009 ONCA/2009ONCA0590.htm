  <p class=headingNUMBER>[1]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Royal Bank (the “Bank”) brings this motion for security for costs pursuant
    to rule 61.06(1).  Mr. Korman has made a consumer proposal in bankruptcy
    in which he states that his assets are estimated at $5,202, his earnings
    are approximately $10,000 a month, and he has unsecured liabilities estimated
    at $417,518.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[2]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>An
    appreciation of this motion requires consideration of the history of the
    litigation.  The Bank obtained default judgment against Korman in the amount
    of $52,730.85 plus interest and costs based on his personal guarantee of
    a loan it had made to his company, Futurecom Inc.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[3]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Bank then examined Korman in aid of execution of the judgment.  In his examination,
    Korman admitted to filling out a false personal statement of affairs.  As
    a result, the Bank brought a motion to convert its default judgment into
    a judgment in fraud pursuant to rule 59.06(2)(a).  That rule enables a party
    to bring a motion to vary an order “on the ground of fraud or of facts arising
    or discovered after it was made”.  Korman consented to the motion with the
    advice of his counsel, Mr. Horowitz.  The Bank obtained the consent order
    on February 27, 2008.  The effect of the order is that the Bank’s judgment
    will survive Korman’s bankruptcy and become a judgment against Korman personally.  After
    Korman made his proposal in bankruptcy, he moved to set aside the consent
    order.  Horowitz filed an affidavit in support of the motion.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[4]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Horowitz’s
    affidavit states that the Bank’s motion record to amend the default judgment
    was served on him, and that he did not meet with Korman in person to discuss
    the motion but instead spoke with him about it on the telephone.  Horowitz
    told Korman the Bank’s motion was to add to the default judgment the name “Israel
    Ian Korman” on the basis that Korman had fraudulently provided the name “Ian
    Israel Korman” instead.  Horowitz says that he told Korman that he did not
    believe that Korman would experience any prejudice if the Bank’s order was
    granted, and advised him to consent to it so as to avoid the prospect of
    an adverse cost award.  It appears that Korman did not see the Bank’s motion
    record.  Horowitz received a copy of the consent order on about March 13,
    2008, but did not provide Korman with a copy of it.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[5]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>After
    receiving the consent order, Horowitz realized that the name change was only
    part of the Bank’s motion.  His affidavit says that he misunderstood the
    motion and did not fully communicate to Korman either the nature of the order
    sought or the consequence that a judgment for fraud survives bankruptcy and
    remains a personal debt of Korman.  Horowitz wrote to the Bank indicating
    that Korman had “never abandoned his legal right to take action to set aside
    the judgment.”  The Bank replied that Korman had signed a consent to the
    order sought, and that “amongst other obstacles in his way to having the
    judgment set aside, there is now his Consent to the money owing under the
    Bank’s judgment as being monies owed in fraud.”  Horowitz did not advise
    Korman of the situation until approximately July 2008.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[6]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Korman’s
    motion to set aside the consent judgment was dismissed.  He has appealed
    and it is that appeal that has triggered the Bank’s motion for security for
    costs.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[7]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    Bank’s submissions in support of its motion for security for costs of the
    appeal may be summarized as follows.  First, pursuant to rule 61.06(1)(a),
    Korman’s appeal is frivolous and vexatious.  The Bank did nothing to induce
    Korman’s mistake and is not responsible for it.  Further, Korman has insufficient
    assets in
    <st1:State
w:st="on">
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    Ontario to pay the costs of the appeal.  Second, security for costs should
    be ordered pursuant to rule 61.06(1)(b) on the basis that Korman has two
    orders for costs in favour of the Bank outstanding against him in the combined
    amount of approximately $4,000 dating back to April 2007 and April 2008 that
    remain unpaid.  Third, fraud is an “other good reason” for making an order
    for security for costs pursuant to rule 61.06(1)(c): see <i>Hall-Chem Inc.
    v. Vulcan Packaging Inc.</i> (1994), 27 C.P.C. (3d) 104 (Ont. C.A.), at para.
    25. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[8]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Korman’s
    counsel on this motion acknowledges Korman’s impecuniosity.  However, he
    submits that justice demands that Korman be permitted to continue with his
    appeal, and that he meets the high threshold required to satisfy the court
    of his appeal’s chances of success. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[9]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Korman
    submits that, as fraud was never pleaded in the Bank’s statement of claim,
    the Bank cannot avail itself of rule 59.06(2)(a).  There is some support
    for this proposition in <i>Russell v. Brown</i>,<i> </i>[1948] O.R. 835 (C.A.).  However,
    the effect of any rule changes subsequent to this authority would need to
    be considered. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[10]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Korman
    further submits that he did not commit a fraud in that his admitted lie on
    his personal statement of affairs had no bearing on the Bank’s decision to
    lend money to Futurecom.  All of the money had already been advanced to Futurecom
    before Korman’s personal guarantee was given.  In addition, Korman argues
    that the personal statement of affairs was submitted for the purpose of the
    Bank assisting him to obtain money from an outside lender, and was not a
    representation to the Bank. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[11]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge dismissed both of these arguments.  On the second issue, the
    affidavit evidence of Korman and the Bank’s representative, Cutone, is in
    conflict as to the purpose of the statement of affairs.  The motion judge
    held that he did not need to make findings of credibility “because the records
    themselves show that funds were advanced to Mr. Korman on the accounts.”  Korman
    submits that, at the very least, the motion judge ought to have ordered a
    trial on this issue.  </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[12]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Korman
    also submits that, in dismissing his motion, the motion judge appears to
    have misapprehended the evidence.  The motion judge held, at para. 10 of
    his endorsement, that:</p>
  <p class=Doubleindent-quote>Mr. Korman says that his solicitor, Mr. Horowitz,
    misconstrued the Bank’s motion.  He says it was a mistake, but there was
    no reliable evidence before the Court that it was.  Mr. Korman has refused
    to permit a waiver of the privilege that might shed any light on what actually
    transpired between himself and the solicitor.  Neither is Mr. Korman willing
    to permit any insight into the basis of a claim he has apparently made against
    Law Pro regarding the solicitor.  Most importantly here, however, is that
    Mr. Korman’s protestations that the solicitor has admitted his mistake are
    of little value when there is no corroborative evidence before the Court
    that would add any reliability or weight to Mr. Korman’s assertion and complaint. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[13]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
    motion judge’s comments do not reference the affidavit filed by Horowitz
    in support of Korman’s motion, and thus appear to be a misapprehension of
    the evidence. </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[14]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Inasmuch
    as the motion judge appears to have misapprehended the evidence, the next
    question I must address is the effect of this error.  If, notwithstanding
    the motion judge’s error, the motion appears to have no chance of succeeding,
    it would be appropriate to order security for costs.   </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[15]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> A
    consent judgment is not a judicial determination on the merits of the case,
    but an agreement elevated to the status of an order on consent.  The basis
    of the order is the parties’
    agreement and not a judicial determination of what is fair and reasonable
    in the circumstances.  A consent order may be set aside on the same basis
    for setting aside a contract: <i>Teitelbaum v. Dyson</i> (2000), 7 CPC (5th)
    356 (
    <st1:place w:st="on">
    <st1:City w:st="on">
    Ont.
    <st1:State w:st="on">
    S.C.), at para. 38, aff’d (2001) 151 O.A.C. 399 (
    <st1:country-region w:st="on">
      <st1:place
 w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ).  A self-induced unilateral mistake is not ordinarily a basis for setting
    aside a contract.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[16]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>    The
    recent decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in <i>Rick v. Brandsema</i>,
    [2009] S.C.J. No. 10<i>, </i>dealt with the setting aside of a consent order
    incorporating the terms of a separation agreement.  Abella J., writing on
    behalf of the court, held that decisions about what constitutes an acceptable
    bargain can only be made if both parties come to the table with the information
    needed to consider what concessions to accept or offer.  Where an agreement
    is based on misinformation, it cannot be a true bargain entitled to judicial
    deference.  In that case, Abella J. held that the husband had a duty to make
    full disclosure to the wife of his financial condition when negotiating the
    settlement agreement, and that his failure to do so constituted exploitation
    of her.  Abella J. held, at para. 61, “exploitation is not rendered anodyne
    merely because a spouse has access to professional advice”.</p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER>[17]<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span> Korman
    does not, however, allege misconduct on the part of the Bank.  He does not
    allege that the Bank owed a duty of good faith and fair dealing to tell Korman
    that the effect of its motion would mean that he would remain personally
    liable to pay the debt owed to the Bank, notwithstanding any proposal in
    bankruptcy.  Rather, in his appeal factum, Korman submits that a client is
    not to be placed irrevocably in jeopardy by reason of the negligence of his
    solicitor, and relies on <i>Halton Community Credit Union Ltd. v. ICL Computers
    Canada </i>(1985)<i>, </i>1 C.P.C. (2d) 24 (Ont. C.A.), at p. 27, as support
    for this proposition.    </p>
  <p class=headingNUMBER><span

    the value that the law places on finality, there will be situations in which
    other legitimate interests outweigh finality concerns.  I<span lang=EN-US

    (Ont.

      <st1:place w:st="on">
      C.A.</st1:country-region>
    ), Blair J.A. refused to order security for costs despite the fact that the
    respondent was impecunious and had failed to pay previous costs awards.  He
    refused because a &quot;worthy but impecunious litigant&quot; should not
    be deprived of the opportunity to have his claim adjudicated &quot;when it
    is not plainly devoid of merit&quot;.  Blair J.A. was satisfied that ordering
    security for costs would prevent the appellant from continuing with the appeal.
     I am satisfied that this case presents a similar situation.</span></p>
